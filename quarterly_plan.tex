\title{Quarter Project Plan}

\maketitle

\section*{Instructions}
In this assignment, you will create a detailed plan for your final quarter of Senior Project.  
This plan must include:  
\begin{itemize}
    \item A clear summary of your project’s current state.  
    \item A roadmap describing your goals for this quarter and why they matter.  
    \item A list of specific deliverables to complete by the end of the quarter.  
    \item A customized rubric that will be used to assess your final deliverables.  
    \item Defined roles and responsibilities for each team member.  
    \item Documentation of your working spaces, communication tools, and meeting times.  
\end{itemize}

Your plan should be **concrete and measurable**—avoid vague goals like "improve code quality" and instead write "achieve 85\% test coverage on all modules."  


\section*{Project Current State}
This project has a frontend, backend database, integration, and a working search function. We currently have ~80\% code coverage regarding testing. Currently hosted by WWU at star.cs.wwu.edu. We have more to implement, primarily regarding database expansion, frontend completion (filling in non-critical gaps), and narrowing the search function for more acurrate results.

\section*{Project Roadmap}
\textbf{Weeks 1-3}: We will be playing catchup with eachother, as all of us had 3 months off. Most of us haven't had a chance to check the deployment, so there's a lot of knowledge that needs to be diffused regarding deployment techinque, what that directory looks like. We also hope to iron out some kinks regarding the frontend, and regain our footing with the Database to begin using it dynamically instead of showing a certain number of results live. 
\\\\
\textbf{Weeks 4-6}: Majority of work done here. Fully complete frontend-backend connection, fleshed out frontend. Automation worked on here to get updates automated from github to live server, instead of manual.
\\\\
\textbf{Weeks 7-10}: Ironing out kinks. Manual testing and quality control. Making sure server usage doesn't risk a crash under load. Certifying search function reports live, accurate results and our database is functional.

\section*{Project Deliverables}
% List out the specific things you will have completed by the end of the quarter.
\textbf{Examples of concrete deliverables:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fully functional event scheduling app deployed on AWS.  
    \item Minimum of 85\% unit test coverage for backend modules and 70\% for frontend components.  
    \item Documentation package including: user manual, developer guide, deployment instructions.  
    \item Final presentation slides and demo video.  
\end{itemize}



\section*{Final Deliverables Rubric}
Your rubric should include at least 5--6 criteria. Adapt the criteria to your project’s scope.  

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|X|X|X|X|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Criterion} & \textbf{Excellent} & \textbf{Good} & \textbf{Needs Improvement} & \textbf{No Submission}\\
    \hline
  Criterion 1 (e.g., Technical Execution) & [Define what constitutes excellent performance] & [Define what constitutes good performance] & [Define what constitutes performance needing improvement] & Did not demonstrate this criterion. \\
    \hline     
      Criterion 2 (e.g., Test Coverage) & $\geq$ 85\% backend and $\geq$ 70\% frontend test coverage & 70--84\% backend and 50--69\% frontend test coverage & Less than 70\% backend or 50\% frontend test coverage & No testing evidence. \\
    \hline
    Criterion 3 (e.g., Documentation) &  &  &  & Did not demonstrate this criterion. \\
    \hline
    % Add more rows as needed
    
\end{tabularx}



\section*{Team Roles}
% Define the roles for each team member, including responsibilities and expectations. Ensure that roles are aligned with the project's needs and each member's skills.


\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|X|X|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Team Member} & \textbf{Strength} & \textbf{Role and Responsibilities} \\
    \hline
    Member 1 & [Define Team Member Strength] & [Define role and responsibilities] \\
    \hline
    Member 2 & & \\
    \hline
    % Add more rows as needed
\end{tabularx}

\section*{Working Spaces, Communication, and Meeting Times}
\textbf{Examples:}  
\begin{itemize}
    \item GitHub Repository: \texttt{https://github.com/TipsyCanoe/Autism-Spectrum-Disorder-ASD-Treatment-Database}  
    \item Trello Board: \texttt{https://trello.com/b/project2025}  
    \item Google Drive (docs, slides): \texttt{https://drive.google.com/project2025}  
    \item Asynchronous Communication: Discord server (\texttt{https://discord.gg/team2025})
    \item Meeting Times: Mondays 4--5pm and Thursdays 11am--12pm.  
\end{itemize}

\section*{Role of AI}
%Describe whether you plan on using AI in your senior project and why. If yes, list the tools you intend to use and describe how you will use each of them. Reflect on the benefits and risks of using (or not using) AI.
