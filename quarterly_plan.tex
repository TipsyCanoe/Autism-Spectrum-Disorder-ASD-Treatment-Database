\title{Quarter Project Plan}
\author{[Sendan Center Autism Resource Database]}
\date{Fall 2025}

\begin{document}

\maketitle


\section*{Project Current State}
This project has a frontend, backend database, integration, and a working search function. We currently have around 80\% code coverage regarding testing. Currently hosted by WWU at star.cs.wwu.edu. We have more to implement, primarily regarding database expansion, frontend completion (filling in non-critical gaps), and narrowing the search function for more accurate results.

\section*{Project Roadmap}
\textbf{Weeks 1-3}: We will be using this time to reorganize ourselves with the project, and meeting with our customer to determine remaining requirements. Through initial meetings, we can also determine what current deployment modules are unsatisfactory. We also hope to iron out some kinks regarding the frontend, and regain our footing with the Database to begin using it dynamically instead of showing only a certain number of results live. 
\\\\
\textbf{Weeks 4-6}: Majority of work done here. Fully complete frontend-backend connection, fleshed out frontend. Automation worked on here to get updates automated from Github to live server, instead of manual. Refine our summary generated by our local LLAMA model to make it more accurate. 
\\\\
\textbf{Weeks 7-10}: Ironing out kinks. Manual testing and quality control. Ideally we have user testing to make sure that everything works correctly and how it should feel. Making sure server usage doesn't risk a crash under load, so that systems become dysfunctional. Certifying search function reports live, accurate results and our database is functional.

\section*{Project Deliverables}
% List out the specific things you will have completed by the end of the quarter.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Website deployed on WWU, accessible to all public.
    \item Database fully integrated with website, papers are relevant to searched topic and summary contains accurate info pertaining to statistics of research.
    \item Minimum of 85\% unit test coverage for backend modules and 70\% for frontend components.  
    \item Documentation package including: user manual, developer guide, deployment instructions.  
    \item Final presentation slides and demo video.  
\end{itemize}



\section*{Final Deliverables Rubric}
Your rubric should include at least 5--6 criteria. Adapt the criteria to your projectâ€™s scope.  

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|X|X|X|X|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Criterion} & \textbf{Excellent} & \textbf{Good} & \textbf{Needs Improvement} & \textbf{No Submission}\\
    \hline
    Accuracy & Search results pertain to the desired topic, summary is relevant and adds to the abstract, user testing is completed & Search results pertain to the desired topic, summary is relevant but does not add to abstract & Search results pertain to the desired topic, summary is not relevant & Search results are not relevant to the desired topic, summary is not relevant\\
    \hline     
    Performance & Results are obtained within 5 seconds, continues functioning when updating database & Results are obtained within 10 seconds, continues functioning when updating database & Results are obtained over 10 seconds, ceases functioning when updating database & Searches fail to return anything. \\
    \hline
    Automation & Updates for database and general codebase is fully automatic & Updates for database and general codebase is mostly automatic (e.g. manual restart for errors or unexpected shutdowns) & Updates for database is automatic, general codebase is not & Updates for database and general codebase must be done manually \\
    \hline     
     Test Coverage & $\geq$ 85\% backend and $\geq$ 70\% frontend test coverage & 70--84\% backend and 50--69\% frontend test coverage & Less than 70\% backend or 50\% frontend test coverage & No testing evidence. \\
    \hline
    Documentation & Documentation fully understandable for customer, able to use guide to troubleshoot problems, know how to reach support if needed &  Documentation mostly understandable for customer, sometimes reaches support for regular maintenance (errors or changing update criteria) &  Documentation largely not useful for customer, regularly reaches out for support & Did not demonstrate this criterion. \\
    \hline

\section*{Role of AI}
%Describe whether you plan on using AI in your senior project and why. If yes, list the tools you intend to use and describe how you will use each of them. Reflect on the benefits and risks of using (or not using) AI.
We have used generative AI to create boiler plate code (in regarding testing, typing out "name = main" methods, etc.), and have used it to brainstorm examples of existing systems similar to what we are doing now. These examples are manually reviewed, and always treated with caution to what info they provide. AI can be a large help in reducing time for research and typing out tedious code, but there is always a risk of it providing false information. And when using generated code, make sure that one knows what it is generating and what does it mean. \\\\ 
AI is also used to brainstorm potential features that would further the project along. For example, when working on testing features, We were unaware that the npm package provided a command to reflect a table of total code coverage after tests were run. A cursory AI ask regarding testing revealed this command and made testing much easier. Along with that, none of us have experience running a Virtual Machine and live server, and having a resource to guide us in the right direction is indispensable.\\\\
We also used AI to summarize articles in our database. The benefits of using AI is greatly expanding the amount of data we can show. We have about 100 human summarized articles but with AI we could summarize all the data we get from PubMed. The downside of AI will be the risk of AI summarizing the data incorrectly. To combat this we will, clearly mark all AI data, provide disclaimers on AI data, allow users to hide AI data from results, and finetune our LLM to give more accurate data.
