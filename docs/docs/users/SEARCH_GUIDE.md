# Search Guide

In this page, you will be able to learn how to search effectively in our database.

Upon entering the Search Page, you should be greeted with this:

## Results

To the left are the studies that pertain to your search. By default, all studies are loaded. You can click on a treatment title and bring up the relevant studies. Clicking on the study will bring up a brief summary, including the **primary outcome area**, **primary outcome measure**, **the treatment duration**, **publication date**, **authors**, **PMID** in Pubmed, and the **link** to the study in Pubmed.

## Filters

You can also include filters for your search. We have **age**, **symptoms and behaviors**, **gender**, and **medication type** as available filters, to narrow down the result.

## Most Recent Results

If you feel like the studies are out-of-date, please click the **Update Database** button on the Home Page. This will update our database and help detect the most up-to-date papers. The database can only be updated once per day due to the AI needing one day to finish. We appreciate your patience for the needed time.

We normally update our database once a week on Mondays, so if a paper came out after then, please feel free to update.
