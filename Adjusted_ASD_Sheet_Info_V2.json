Previous studies showed significantly less alpha activity in autism than normal children. Therefore, we studied the effects of anodal tDCS on peak alpha frequency (PAF) related to autism treatment evaluation checklist (ATEC). Twenty male children with autism were randomly assigned in a crossover design to receive a single session of both active and sham tDCS stimulation (11 mA) over F3 (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). Pre- to postsession changes in a measure of cortical activity impacted by tDCS (PAF) and ATEC were compared between groups. We also examined the associations between pre- and postsession changes in the PAF and ATEC. The results show significant pre- to postsession improvements in two domains of ATEC (social and health\/behavior domains) following active tDCS, relative to sham treatment. PAF also significantly increased at the stimulation site, and an increase in PAF was significantly associated with improvements in the two domains of ATEC impacted by tDCS. The findings suggest that a single session of anodal tDCS over the F3 may have clinical benefits in children with autism and that those benefits may be related to an increase in PAF.","1":"To evaluate the anti-spasticity effects of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in individuals with spastic cerebral palsy (CP). Forty-six children and adolescents with cerebral palsy were randomly assigned to either active (1 mA anodal) or sham (placebo) tDCS over the left primary motor cortex (Ml) on five consecutive days. Both group also received routine physical therapy. Measures of spasticity and passive range of motion (PROM) were administered before treatment, immediately after treatment, and at 24- and 48-hours follow-up. Participants assigned to active tDCS treatment evidenced significantly more pre- to immediately post-treatment reductions in spasticity than participants assigned to the sham (p = 0.004, p<O. 001l, andp = 0.004 for shoulder wrist, and fingers respectively) and these improvement in spasticity maintainedfor at least 48 hours for wrist joints (p = 0.023). There was only one participant in the active tDCS condition developed erythematous rash. However, all participants tolerated the tDCS well without any serious adverse events. Anodal tDCS appeared to reduce CP-relatedspasticity (but not PROM) in the short term. Researches examine the long term benefits of this intervention on spasticity are warranted.","2":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC), and Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) after anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in individuals with autism. Twenty patients with autism received 5 consecutive days of both sham and active tDCS stimulation (1 mA) in a randomized double-blind crossover trial over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (F3) for 20 minutes in different orders. Measures of CARS, ATEC, and CGAS were administered before treatment and at 7 days posttreatment. The result showed statistical decrease in CARS score (P < 0.001). ATEC total was decreased from 67.25 to 58 (P < 0.001). CGAS was increased at 7 days posttreatment (P = 0.042). Our study suggests that anodal tDCS over the F3 may be a useful clinical tool in autism.","3":"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has demonstrated efficacy for reducing neuropathic pain, but the respective mechanisms remain largely unknown. The current study tested the hypothesis that pain reduction with tDCS is associated with an increase in the peak frequency spectrum density in the theta-alpha range. Twenty patients with spinal cord injury and bilateral neuropathic pain received single sessions of both sham and anodal tDCS (2 mA) over the left primary motor area (M1) for 20 min. Treatment order was randomly assigned. Pre- to post-procedure changes in pain intensity and peak frequency of electroencephalogram spectral analysis were compared between treatment conditions. The active treatment condition (anodal tDCS over M1) but not sham treatment resulted in significant decreases in pain intensity. In addition, consistent with the study hypothesis, peak theta-alpha frequency (PTAF) assessed from an electrode placed over the site of stimulation increased more from pre- to post-session among participants in the active tDCS condition, relative to those in the sham tDCS condition. Moreover, we found a significant association between a decrease in pain intensity and an increase in PTAF at the stimulation site. The findings are consistent with the possibility that anodal tDCS over the left M1 may be effective, at least in part, because it results in an increase in M1 cortical excitability, perhaps due to a pain inhibitory effect of motor cortex stimulation that may influence the descending pain modulation system. Future research is needed to determine if there is a causal association between increased left anterior activity and pain reduction. The results provide new findings regarding the effects of tDCS on neuropathic pain and brain oscillation changes.","4":"Several lines of emerging data point to an imbalance between neuronal excitation and inhibition in at least a subgroup of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including in those with fragile X syndrome (FXS), one of the most common genetic syndromes within ASD. In animal models of FXS and of ASD, GABA-B agonists have improved both brain and behavioral phenotypes, including social behavior. A phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial found that the GABA-B agonist arbaclofen improved social avoidance symptoms in FXS. A pilot open-label trial of arbaclofen suggested similar benefits in ASD. We therefore evaluated arbaclofen in a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study of 150 participants, aged 5-21 years, with ASD. No difference from placebo was detected on the primary outcome measure, the parent-rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist Social Withdrawal\/Lethargy subscale. However, a specified secondary analysis found improvement on the clinician-rated Clinical Global Impression of Severity. An exploratory post hoc analysis of participants with a consistent rater across the trial revealed greater improvement in the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales II socialization domain in participants receiving arbaclofen. Affect lability (11%) and sedation (9%) were the most common adverse events. In this exploratory study, secondary analyses suggest that arbaclofen may have the potential to improve symptoms in some children with ASD, but further study will be needed to replicate and extend these initial findings.","5":"STX209 (arbaclofen), a selective GABA-B agonist, is hypothesized to modulate the balance of excitatory to inhibitory neurotransmission, and has shown preliminary evidence of benefit in fragile X syndrome. We evaluated its safety, tolerability, and efficacy in non-syndromic autism spectrum disorders, in an 8-week open-label trial enrolling 32 children and adolescents with either Autistic Disorder or Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified, and a score \u226517 on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC)-Irritability subscale. STX209 was generally well-tolerated. The most common adverse events were agitation and irritability, which typically resolved without dose changes, and were often felt to represent spontaneous variation in underlying symptoms. Improvements were observed on several outcome measures in this exploratory trial, including the ABC-Irritability (the primary endpoint) and the Lethargy\/Social Withdrawal subscales, the Social Responsiveness Scale, the CY-BOCS-PDD, and clinical global impression scales. Placebo-controlled study of STX209 is warranted.","6":"Research on animal models of fragile X syndrome suggests that STX209, a \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type B (GABA(B)) agonist, might improve neurobehavioral function in affected patients. We evaluated whether STX209 improves behavioral symptoms of fragile X syndrome in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in 63 subjects (55 male), ages 6 to 39 years, with a full mutation in the FMR1 gene (>200 CGG triplet repeats). We found no difference from placebo on the primary endpoint, the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability (ABC-I) subscale. In the other analyses specified in the protocol, improvement was seen on the visual analog scale ratings of parent-nominated problem behaviors, with positive trends on multiple global measures. Post hoc analysis with the ABC-Social Avoidance scale, a newly validated scale for the assessment of fragile X syndrome, showed a significant beneficial treatment effect in the full study population. A post hoc subgroup of 27 subjects with more severe social impairment showed improvements on the Vineland II-Socialization raw score, on the ABC-Social Avoidance scale, and on all global measures. STX209 was well tolerated, with 8% incidences of sedation and of headache as the most frequent side effects. In this exploratory study, STX209 did not show a benefit on irritability in fragile X syndrome. Nonetheless, our results suggest that GABA(B) agonists have potential to improve social function and behavior in patients with fragile X syndrome.","7":"We evaluated the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole in the treatment of irritability in children and adolescents (6-17\u00a0years) with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 8-week study in Japan. Patients received flexibly dosed aripiprazole (1-15\u00a0mg\/day) or placebo. Ninety-two patients were randomized to placebo (n\u2009=\u200945) or aripiprazole (n\u2009=\u200947). Aripiprazole produced a significant improvement in the mean parent\/caregiver-rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist Japanese Version irritability subscale score relative to placebo from week 3 through week 8. Administration of aripiprazole provided significantly greater improvement in the mean clinician-rated Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scores than placebo from week 2 through week 8. All patients randomized to aripiprazole completed the study, and no serious adverse events were reported. Three patients in placebo group discontinued. Aripiprazole was effective and generally safe and well-tolerated in the treatment of irritability associated with ASD in Japanese children and adolescents.","8":"<b><i>Introduction:<\/i><\/b> The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) is a widely accepted outcome measure for pediatric schizophrenia trials; however, it has notable limitations. Psychometric investigations have shown a multifactorial structure and some items have limited utility assessing symptom severity in children. To address these issues, we developed and evaluated optimized 10- and 20-item PANSS short-forms (PANSS10 and PANSS20) using patient-level clinical trial data. This study further assesses these optimized forms using independent clinical trial data. <b><i>Methods:<\/i><\/b> We examined patient-level data from a randomized pediatric schizophrenia trial comparing paliperidone ER to aripiprazole. Data were accessed through the Yale Open Data Access (YODA) secure platform. Analyses included confirmatory factor analyses, graded response models, \u03c9 score reliability, internal consistency, sensitivity to change, and criterion validity versus the Clinical Global Impressions of Severity (CGI-S). Bland-Altman analyses examined score calibration versus the 30-item PANSS and inclusion cut scores. <b><i>Results:<\/i><\/b> Participants (<i>N<\/i> = 288) were ages 12 to 17 years (<i>M<\/i> = 15.3, SD = 1.46; 66% male). Total scores for the PANSS10 and PANSS20 showed strong correlations with the 30-item PANSS (0.90 and 0.97, respectively). Average inter-item correlations were 0.10 and 0.14 and \u03c9<sup>Total<\/sup> reliabilities were 0.74 and 0.85. Both PANSS10 and PANSS20 scores showed reliability >0.80-2.3 to 4.5 SD and -3.0 to 6.0 SD about mean symptom severity, respectively. Sensitivity to treatment was also similar (partial <i>eta<\/i> squared 0.23 and 0.22), as was correlation with CGI-S at baseline (0.45 and 0.48; not significantly different). The mean item-average discrepancy with the 30-item PANSS was 0.095 for PANSS10 and 0.033 for PANSS20. <b><i>Conclusions:<\/i><\/b> The optimized PANSS forms continue to show impressive reliability, validity, and calibration compared with the 30-item PANSS. Researchers should consider replacing the 30-item PANSS with the PANSS10 as a clinical outcome and screening measure due to its length and psychometric performance.","9":"To determine if acute treatment with aripiprazole (APZ) would be superior to treatment with placebo in reducing dysfunctional symptoms of elevated mood and\/or irritability in symptomatic children and adolescents at familial high risk for bipolar disorder (BPD) whose mood episodes occur spontaneously. These are patients we have previously referred to as suffering from \"cyclotaxia.\" This was single-site, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled outpatient clinical trial in which youths aged 5-17 years who met diagnostic criteria for either cyclothymic disorder (CYC) or BPD not otherwise specified (BP-NOS) were randomly assigned to receive either APZ or placebo. Eligible participants had at least one parent with BPD, another first- or second-degree relative afflicted with a mood disorder, and also had not responded to psychotherapy. Treatment with APZ was initiated at a dose of approximately 0.1\u2009mg\/kg\/day and could be increased by approximately 0.05\u2009mg\/kg\/day at each study visit. Patients were seen weekly for 4 weeks and then every other week thereafter for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was mean change from baseline on Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score. A total of 59 patients (30 APZ, 29 placebo) aged 11.8 (SD\u2009=\u20092.7) years were randomized and returned for at least one postbaseline assessment. The mean total daily doses of active APZ and placebo were 7.1\u2009mg (SD\u2009=\u20093.7) and 7.4\u2009mg (SD\u2009=\u20094.2), respectively. At the 12-week time point, APZ was superior to placebo on the primary outcome measure (p\u2009<\u20090.005). Most adverse events were mild and transient in nature. There was a significant difference in weight gain from baseline between patients who received APZ (2.3\u2009kg [SD\u2009=\u20093.3]) and those who received placebo (0.7\u2009kg [SD\u2009=\u20091.8]). This double-blind trial found that APZ was significantly more efficacious than placebo in reducing symptoms of mania in children and adolescents with cyclotaxia.","10":"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole versus placebo in preventing relapse of irritability symptoms associated with autistic disorder in pediatric patients. This multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, relapse-prevention trial enrolled patients (6-17 years) who met the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DMS-IV-TR) criteria for autistic disorder and who also had serious behavioral problems (ie, tantrums, aggression, self-injurious behavior, or a combination of these behavioral problems) between March 2011 and June 2012. In phase 1, single-blind aripiprazole was flexibly dosed (2-15 mg\/d) for 13-26 weeks. Patients with a stable response (\u2265 25% decrease in Aberrant Behavior Checklist-irritability subscale score and a rating of \"much improved\" or \"very much improved\" on the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale) for 12 consecutive weeks were randomized into phase 2 to continue aripiprazole or switch to placebo. Treatment was continued until relapse or up to 16 weeks. The primary end point was time from randomization to relapse. Eighty-five patients were randomized in phase 2. The difference in time to relapse between aripiprazole and placebo was not statistically significant (P = .097). Kaplan-Meier relapse rates at week 16 were 35% for aripiprazole and 52% for placebo (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.57; number needed to treat [NNT] = 6). The most common adverse events during phase 1 were weight increase (25.2%), somnolence (14.8%), and vomiting (14.2%); and, during phase 2 (aripiprazole vs placebo), they were upper respiratory tract infection (10.3% vs 2.3%), constipation (5.1% vs 0%), and movement disorder (5.1% vs 0%). In this study, there was no statistically significant difference between aripiprazole and placebo in time to relapse during maintenance therapy. However, the HR and NNT suggest some patients will benefit from maintenance treatment. Patients receiving aripiprazole should be periodically reassessed to determine the continued need for treatment. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01227668.","11":"Published studies in adult and pediatric bipolar disorder have used different definitions of treatment response. This analysis aimed to compare different definitions of response in a large sample of children and adolescents. Anexploratory analysis of a 4-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled study assessed patients (n=296; ages, 10-17 years) with an acute manic\/mixed episode associated with BIPOLAR I disorder who were randomized to aripiprazole (10 or 30\u2009mg\/day) or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was mean change from baseline to week 4 in young mania rating scale (YMRS) total score. Additional assessments included: clinical global impressions-bipolar disorder (CGI-BP) Overall and mania scales, child global assessment scale (CGAS), and parent and subject general behavior inventory. Response was compared across seven operational definitions. Cohen's \u03ba and Spearman's correlation tested relationships between various response definitions or changes in outcome measures and clinically meaningful improvement (defined as a CGI-BP overall improvement score of 1 or 2). Response rates varied depending upon the operational definition, but were highest for 95% reliable change (statistical method used to determine individual change from previous assessment) and \u226533% reduction in YMRS total score. Response rate definitions with the highest validity in terms of predicting clinically meaningful improvement were: \u226550% reduction on YMRS (\u03ba=0.64), a composite definition of response (YMRS <12.5, children's depression rating scale-revised (CDRS-R) \u226440, and CGAS \u226551; \u03ba=0.59), and 95% reliable change on the CGAS or 33% reduction on YMRS (\u03ba=0.56). Parent ratings of symptoms were generally better at detecting symptom improvement than were subject ratings (\u03ba=\u223c0.4-0.5 vs. \u223c0.2 when compared with CGI-BP overall improvement score). Clinically meaningful definitions of response in acute treatment of a manic\/mixed episode in pediatric subjects include a 50% change in YMRS and a composite measure of response. Parent-reported measures of symptom improvement appear reliable for assessing symptom change.","12":"\u2002 To evaluate the long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of aripiprazole in pediatric subjects with bipolar I disorder. \u2002 A randomized, double-blind, 30-week, placebo-controlled study of aripiprazole (10 or 30\u2003mg\/day) in youths (10-17\u2003years) with bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed) \u00b1 psychotic features (n\u2003=\u2003296) was performed. After four weeks, acute treatment completers continued receiving \u226426\u2003weeks of double-blind treatment (n\u2003=\u2003210). The primary outcome was Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score change. \u2002 Of the 210 subjects who entered the 26-week extension phase, 32.4% completed the study (45.3% for aripiprazole 10\u2003mg\/day, 31.0% for aripiprazole 30\u2003mg\/day, and 18.8% for placebo). Both aripiprazole doses demonstrated significantly (p\u2003<\u20030.001) greater improvements in YMRS total score at endpoint compared with placebo in protocol-specified last observation carried forward analyses, but not in observed case or mixed-model repeated measures at week 30. Overall time to all-cause discontinuation was longer for aripiprazole 10\u2003mg\/day (15.6\u2003weeks) and aripiprazole 30\u2003mg\/day (9.5\u2003weeks) compared with placebo (5.3\u2003weeks; both p\u2003<\u20030.05 versus placebo). Both aripiprazole doses were significantly superior to placebo regarding response rates, Children's Global Assessment of Functioning and Clinical Global Impressions-Bipolar severity of overall and mania scores at endpoint in all analyses. Commonly reported adverse events included headache, somnolence, and extrapyramidal disorder. \u2002 Aripiprazole 10\u2003mg\/day and 30\u2003mg\/day were superior to placebo and generally well tolerated in pediatric subjects with bipolar I disorder up to 30\u2003weeks. Despite the benefits of treatment, completion rates were low in all treatment arms.","13":"Few studies have evaluated the value of a parent- and subject-rated scale in detecting symptom change in response to pharmacologic treatment. This was a post-hoc analysis of data from a 4-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate which informants detect response to treatment with aripiprazole in pediatric subjects experiencing a mixed or manic episode associated with bipolar I disorder. Efficacy assessments included clinician-rated scales and the parent- and subject-rated 10-item General Behavior Inventory Mania (GBI-M10) and Depression (GBI-D10) scales. Cohen's d quantified effect sizes for total scale scores and individual line items. Parent-GBI-M10 total, clinician-rated Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total, and Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar Disorder (CGI-BP) Mania scores produced similar effect sizes, suggesting that the parent-GBI-M10 is sensitive to treatment-related improvements in manic symptoms. Aripiprazole improved a broad spectrum of parent-rated mania symptoms; six parent-GBI-M10 line item effect sizes were moderate (>0.5) in at least one of the two aripiprazole treatment arms (10 or 30 mg\/day). Subject-completed GBI-M10 line item effect sizes were consistently smaller, indicating that the subjects' experience of treatment effects were less pronounced. Study inclusion\/exclusion criteria may limit generalizability of these findings. Parent ratings of mania severity were in agreement with clinician ratings, indicating that parent-rated assessments can be valuable in detecting symptom change over the course of treatment. These data support the use of the parent-GBI-M10 as an outcome measure in research and clinical settings.","14":"This study evaluates the long-term efficacy of aripiprazole compared to placebo in children with bipolar disorders. Outpatients aged 4 to 9 years meeting DSM-IV criteria for a bipolar disorder (I, II, not otherwise specified, cyclothymia) were eligible to receive up to 16 weeks of open-label treatment with aripiprazole (phase 1). Patients were randomized into the 72-week double-blind phase of the study once they met a priori response criteria for stabilization (phase 2). During phase 2, patients either remained on their current aripiprazole regimen or began a double-blind taper with aripiprazole discontinued and switched to placebo. The primary outcome measure for phase 2 was time to discontinuation due to a mood event. Patients were recruited between May 2004 and November 2008. Following phase 1, in which 96 patients received aripiprazole, 30 patients (mean age = 7.1 years) were randomly assigned to continue aripiprazole and 30 patients (mean age = 6.7 years) were randomly assigned to placebo. The mean (SD) dose of aripiprazole prior to randomization for these patients was 6.4 (2.1) mg\/d. Patients randomly assigned to aripiprazole were enrolled significantly longer until time to study discontinuation due to a mood event (6.14 median weeks, SE \u00b1 11.88 weeks; P = .005) and discontinuation for any reason (including mood events) (4.00 median weeks, SE \u00b1 3.91 weeks; P = .003) than those randomly assigned to placebo (mood event, 2.29 median weeks, SE \u00b1 0.38 weeks; any reason, 2.00 median weeks, SE \u00b1 0.31 weeks). Regardless of random assignment, both the aripiprazole and placebo groups showed substantial rates of withdrawal from maintenance treatment over the initial 4 weeks (15\/30 [50%] for aripiprazole; 27\/30 [90%] for placebo), suggesting a possible nocebo effect (ie, knowledge of possibly switching from active medication to placebo increasing concern about relapse). The most frequently reported adverse events during double-blind aripiprazole therapy included stomach pain (n = 10, 33%), increased appetite (n = 9, 30%), and headaches (n = 9, 30%). Despite the possibility of a nocebo effect, these results suggest that aripiprazole may be superior to placebo in the long-term treatment of pediatric patients following stabilization with open-label aripiprazole. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00194077.","15":"The purpose of this open-label study was to describe the effectiveness of aripiprazole (APZ) in the treatment of children with bipolar disorders suffering from manic symptomatology. Symptomatic outpatients (Young Mania Rating Scale [YMRS] score \u226515) meeting strict, unmodified, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, diagnostic symptom criteria for a bipolar disorder, ages 4-9 years, were eligible. Subjects were treated prospectively with flexible doses of APZ (maximum daily dose of 15\u2009mg\/day), for up to 16 weeks or until a priori response criteria were met. Outcome measures included the YMRS, Clinical Global Impressions Scale-Severity, Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS), and the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R). A priori response criteria consisted of 3 of 4 consecutive weeks with (1) CDRS-R <29; (2) YMRS <10; and (3) CGAS >50. Ninety-six children (62 males; mean age of 6.9 (SD\u2009=\u20091.7), received APZ for an average length of treatment of 12.5 (SD\u2009=\u20093.9) weeks. Significant improvements in YMRS, CDRS-R, CGAS, and Clinical Global Impressions Scale-Severity scores (p\u2009<\u20090.001) were noted at the end of study participation. Sixty of the subjects (62.5%) met a priori response criteria at study's end. The most common side effects noted were stomachache, increased appetite, and headache. Two subjects were removed from the study due to side effects [epistaxis (n\u2009=\u20091); akathisia (n\u2009=\u20091)]. Subjects experienced an average weight gain of 2.4 (SD\u2009=\u20091.9) kg. APZ may be effective in the acute treatment of symptoms of children with bipolar illnesses.","16":"Evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of aripiprazole in the treatment of irritability in pediatric subjects (6-17 years) with autistic disorder. A 52-week, open-label, flexibly dosed (2-15 mg\/d) study of the safety and tolerability of aripiprazole in outpatients with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of autistic disorder who either had completed 1 of 2 antecedent, 8-week randomized trials or were enrolled de novo (ie, not treated in the randomized trials). Safety and tolerability measures included incidences of adverse events, extrapyramidal symptoms, weight, metabolic measures, vital signs, and other clinical assessments. Subjects were enrolled between September 2006 and June 2009. Three hundred thirty subjects entered the treatment phase: 86 de novo, 174 prior aripiprazole, and 70 prior placebo. A total of 199 (60.3%) subjects completed 52 weeks of treatment. Adverse events were experienced by 286\/330 subjects (86.7%). Common adverse events included weight increase, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, increased appetite, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, and insomnia. Discontinuations due to adverse events occurred in 35\/330 randomized subjects (10.6%)-most commonly aggression and weight increase. One patient discontinued from the study due to a laboratory-related adverse event (moderately increased alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase). Nine subjects experienced serious adverse events-most frequently aggression. Extrapyramidal symptoms-related adverse events occurred in 48\/330 subjects (14.5%)-most commonly tremor (3.0%), psychomotor hyperactivity (2.7%), akathisia (2.4%), and dyskinesia (not tardive, 2.4%). At > 9 months' aripiprazole exposure (n = 220), mean change in body weight z score was 0.33 and body mass index z score was 0.31. The percentages of subjects with clinically significant fasting metabolic abnormalities at > 9 months were 2% for glucose, 5% for total cholesterol, 7% for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 30% for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and 5% for triglycerides. Aripiprazole was generally safe and well tolerated in the long-term treatment of irritability associated with autistic disorder in pediatric subjects. Weight should be proactively monitored during long-term treatment. clinical trials.gov Identifier: NCT00365859.","17":"The objective of this study was to evaluate short-term efficacy and safety of aripiprazole in the treatment of irritability in children and adolescents with autistic disorder who were manifesting behaviors such as tantrums, aggression, self-injurious behavior, or a combination of these. This 8-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was conducted of children and adolescents (aged 6-17 years) with autistic disorder. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to flexibly dosed aripiprazole (target dosage: 5, 10, or 15 mg\/day) or placebo. Efficacy outcome measures included the Aberrant Behavior Checklist irritability subscale and the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement score (CGI-I). Safety and tolerability were also assessed. Ninety-eight patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 51) or aripiprazole (n = 47). Mean improvement in Aberrant Behavior Checklist irritability subscale score was significantly greater with aripiprazole than with placebo from week 1 through week 8. Aripiprazole demonstrated significantly greater global improvements than placebo, as assessed by the mean CGI-I score from week 1 through week 8; however, clinically significant residual symptoms may still persist for some patients. Discontinuation rates as a result of adverse events (AEs) were 10.6% for aripiprazole and 5.9% for placebo. Extrapyramidal symptom-related AE rates were 14.9% for aripiprazole and 8.0% for placebo. No serious AEs were reported. Mean weight gain was 2.0 kg on aripiprazole and 0.8 kg on placebo at week 8.

This was a 52-week, open-label, flexible-dose (2-15 mg\/day) study of aripiprazole for the treatment of children and adolescents with irritability associated with autistic disorder. Eligible subjects were enrolled from two 8-week randomized trials or were enrolled as de novo subjects. \"Prior aripiprazole\" subjects had received treatment with aripiprazole for 8 weeks before entering this study. Evaluation of efficacy, a secondary objective after evaluation of safety and tolerability in this study, was conducted using the caregiver-rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability subscale and the clinician-rated Clinical Global Impression-Improvement score. Three hundred thirty subjects received treatment (de novo, n = 86; prior aripiprazole, n = 174; prior placebo, n = 70) and 199 subjects (60.3%) completed 52 weeks of treatment. At their last study visit, 38.2% of subjects were receiving concomitant central nervous system medications (commonly antidepressants, 13.4%; psychostimulants, 11.5%; antiepileptics, 5.9%). At week 52 (observed cases data set), the mean change from baseline in Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability subscale scores was -8.0 in de novo subjects and -6.1 in prior placebo subjects; prior aripiprazole subjects maintained symptom improvement that was achieved with treatment in the prior study. At endpoint, the majority of subjects had a Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement score of 2 (much improved) or 1 (very much improved). Aripiprazole reduced symptoms of irritability associated with autistic disorder in pediatric subjects ages 6-17 years who were studied for up to 1 year.","19":"These analyses aimed to examine the pattern of improvement in depression symptoms with adjunctive aripiprazole. Data were pooled (724 subjects: n = 356 placebo, n = 368 aripiprazole) from 2 double-blind, 6-week aripiprazole studies. Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were calculated between changes on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) line items and selected Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS) line items using last observation carried forward. The magnitude of change was expressed as a between-group effect size (ES). At end point, adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated significant improvement versus antidepressant therapy alone in 8 of the 10 MADRS items (MADRS total score Cohen effect size = 0.37) and 12 of the 30 IDS items (IDS total score Cohen ES = 0.18). Analysis of correlation data identified 5 MADRS items assessing mood, lassitude, inability to feel, self-worth, and suicidal thoughts that correlated with similar IDS items; these showed a similar pattern of rapid, sustained response to adjunctive aripiprazole and a similar ES. Other symptoms associated with depression (tension associated with feeling anxious, irritability, and lack of concentration) did not show statistically significant changes on either scale at end point. The IDS identified an additional 3 important depression-related symptoms (diminished libido, view of self, and interpersonal sensitivity) that showed significant rapid and sustained improvement with adjunctive aripiprazole. This cross-correlation analysis confirmed that improvement in core depressive symptoms with adjunctive aripiprazole was identified by both clinicians and patients. Clinically, these changes were maintained during the study. Theoretically, these findings lead to important questions regarding neurochemical changes produced by aripiprazole when used in combination with antidepressants.","20":"This study evaluated the long-term tolerability and effectiveness of aripiprazole adjunctive to lithium or valproate in partial responders with bipolar mania. Completers of a 6-week double-blind comparison of adjunctive aripiprazole versus placebo in bipolar mania partially responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy could enter a 46-week extension treatment with open-label adjunctive aripiprazole plus lithium (ARI + LI) or valproate (ARI + VAL). Safety, efficacy and functioning were assessed. CN138-134LT: Study of Aripiprazole in Patients With Bipolar I Disorder; ID number: NCT00257972; registry: www.clinicaltrials.gov. In total, 283 (ARI + LI n = 108; ARI + VAL n = 175) patients entered and 146 (ARI + LI n = 55; ARI + VAL n = 91) completed the 46-week, open-label extension. Frequently reported adverse events (AEs) that occurred with ARI + LI vs. ARI + VAL were: tremor (17.0% vs. 12.1%), akathisia (6.6% vs. 8.6%), headache (6.6% vs. 4.0%), insomnia (9.4% vs. 10.3%), depression (7.5% vs. 9.2%) and weight increase (11.3% vs. 8.6%). Extrapyramidal symptom-related AEs occurred in 24 (22.6%) ARI + LI- and 38 (21.8%) ARI + VAL-treated patients, with eight discontinuations. The majority of new-onset events of akathisia and insomnia occurred early. Mean (SE) weight change from double-blind endpoint to Week 46 (LOCF) was 2.3 (0.6) kg with ARI + LI and 2.0 (0.4) kg with ARI + VAL. Significant improvements from baseline over the 52 weeks (LOCF) occurred with ARI + LI and ARI + VAL on mean (95%CI) YMRS total score (-16.5 [-18.1; -14.8] and -17.6 [-18.9; -16.3], both p < 0.001 vs. baseline) and MADRS total score (-1.7 [-3.3; -0.1], p < 0.05 vs. baseline vs. -2.7 [-4.0; -1.4], p < 0.001 vs. baseline). Over the 46-week extension, continued aripiprazole provided continued YMRS improvement with ARI + LI (-2.9) and ARI + VAL (-3.3), while mean MADRS total changes were +1.1 and +1.0, respectively, and LIFE-RIFT changes were 0.2 and -0.5, respectively. Long-term aripiprazole adjunctive to lithium\/valproate in bipolar mania was safe and well tolerated. Improvements in manic symptoms and functioning were maintained. Aripiprazole, adjunctive to either lithium or valproate, appeared to be equally safe and effective combinations for the treatment of bipolar disorder. As an open-label extension study with a low completion rate, a conservative interpretation of the findings is warranted. Additionally, the study population was not randomly selected but chosen at the discretion of the investigator, and patients did not maintain therapeutic levels of their mood stabiliser consistently.","21":"To evaluate the short-term efficacy and safety of aripiprazole in the treatment of irritability in children and adolescents with autistic disorder. Two hundred eighteen children and adolescents (aged 6-17 years) with a diagnosis of autistic disorder, and with behaviors such as tantrums, aggression, self-injurious behavior, or a combination of these symptoms, were randomized 1:1:1:1 to aripiprazole (5, 10, or 15 mg\/day) or placebo in this 8-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Efficacy was evaluated using the caregiver-rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability subscale (primary efficacy measure) and the clinician-rated Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement score. Safety and tolerability were also assessed. At week 8, all aripiprazole doses produced significantly greater improvement than placebo in mean Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability subscale scores (5 mg\/day, -12.4; 10 mg\/day, -13.2; 15 mg\/day, -14.4; versus placebo, -8.4; all p < .05). All aripiprazole doses demonstrated significantly greater improvements in mean Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement score than placebo at week 8. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were as follows: placebo 7.7%, aripiprazole 5 mg\/day 9.4%, 10 mg\/day 13.6%, and 15 mg\/day 7.4%. The most common adverse event leading to discontinuation was sedation. There were two serious adverse events: presyncope (5 mg\/day) and aggression (10 mg\/day). At week 8, mean weight change (last observation carried forward) was as follows: placebo +0.3 kg, aripiprazole 5 mg\/day +1.3 kg, 10 mg\/day +1.3 kg, and 15 mg\/day +1.5 kg; all p < .05 versus placebo.

This trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of adjunctive aripiprazole versus antidepressant monotherapy in patients with MDD and independently replicated the positive findings of two similar trials. Patients (N=1,147) with MDD experiencing a major depressive episode and a history of inadequate response to antidepressant monotherapy were enrolled (week 0); 827 received single-blind adjunctive placebo plus open-label antidepressant (escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine controlled release, sertraline, or venlafaxine extended release) for 8 weeks to confirm inadequate response to antidepressants; 349 patients with inadequate response were randomized (1:1) to double-blind, adjunctive placebo (n=172) or adjunctive aripiprazole (n=177; 2-20 mg\/day). Primary outcome was the mean change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total score from baseline (week 8) to endpoint (week 14). Clinically significant improvements in depressive symptoms as assessed by decreases in the MADRS Total score were greater with adjunctive aripiprazole (-10.1) than placebo (-6.4; P<.001). Remission rates were greater for adjunctive aripiprazole than for adjunctive placebo (week 14, 36.8% vs 18.9%; P<.001). Completion rates with adjunctive aripiprazole and placebo were high (83% vs. 87%) and discontinuations due to adverse events were low (6.2% vs 1.7%). For some patients with MDD who do not obtain adequate symptom relief with antidepressant monotherapy, adjunctive therapies can significantly improve depressive symptoms. As reported, adjunctive aripiprazole was associated with a two-fold higher remission rate than adjunctive placebo. This, and previous studies, have shown that discontinuations due to adverse events were low and completion rates were high, and has indicated that both antidepressant and aripiprazole in combination were relatively well-tolerated and safe. This is the third consecutive clinical trial, in the absence of a failed trial, to demonstrate that aripiprazole augmentation to antidepressants is an efficacious and well-tolerated treatment for patients with MDD who do not respond adequately to standard antidepressant monotherapy (ClinicalTrials.gov study NCT00105196).","23":"To evaluate the efficacy of adjunctive aripiprazole to standard antidepressant therapy (ADT) for patients with DSM-IV major depressive disorder with anxious\/atypical features at baseline. Data from 2 identical 14-week studies (an 8-week prospective ADT treatment phase and a 6-week randomized, double-blind phase) of aripiprazole augmentation were pooled to evaluate efficacy and safety in the 2 subgroups. The primary efficacy endpoint was mean change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score from end of ADT treatment to end of randomized treatment (last observation carried forward). Anxious depression was defined by a Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression anxiety\/somatization factor score \u2265 7, and atypical depression was defined by previously described criteria on the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report. Both anxious and atypical subtypes were defined based on symptoms at entry into prospective ADT (week 0). Patients were enrolled between June 2004 and April 2006 in one study and from September 2004 to December 2006 in the other (total randomized population, N = 742; anxious\/nonanxious population, N = 740; atypical\/nonatypical population, N = 737). Completion rates were between 84% and 90% and comparable across all subgroups, with low discontinuations due to adverse events. Patients receiving adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated significantly greater improvement in MADRS total score versus patients receiving adjunctive placebo, starting at week 1 or week 2 and continuing through to endpoint (anxious: -8.72 vs. -6.17, p \u2264 .001; nonanxious: -8.61 vs. -4.97, p \u2264 .001; atypical: -9.31 vs. -5.15, p \u2264 .001; nonatypical: -8.08 vs. -6.22, p < .05). At endpoint, remission rates were also significantly higher with adjunctive aripiprazole versus adjunctive placebo (p < .05) in all subgroups. Treatment emergent adverse event profile was similar in all subgroups and comparable to the total population. Reporting of akathisia and weight gain on aripiprazole treatment did not differ between subgroups.

Remission was defined as YMRS total score\u226412. Safety and tolerability were also assessed. Of the 66 patients who entered the extension phase, only 20 patients (30.3%) completed the entire phase (aripiprazole n=7; lithium n=13). The significant improvement that occurred over the first 12 weeks was maintained over the 40 weeks of blinded continuation (from Week 12 through Week 52). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events in the extension phase for aripiprazole were akathisia, headache, somnolence, anxiety and nasopharyngitis (all 8%), and for lithium were insomnia (15.8%), headache (13.2%), diarrhea (13.2%) and vomiting (10.5%). Mean weight change was +2.71 kg for lithium and +5.66 kg for aripiprazole (p=0.46). This trial was not powered to statistically compare active treatments, and long-term completion rates were low in both groups. Aripiprazole monotherapy appears to be equivalently useful to lithium for the extended treatment of mixed or manic bipolar disorder patients.","26":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of aripiprazole in the treatment of discrete symptoms of irritability associated with autistic disorder, as well as other symptoms captured on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC). This was a post hoc analysis of data from two 8-week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trials to evaluate the efficacy of aripiprazole dosed flexibly (2-15 mg\/day, n=47) or fixed (5, 10, or 15 mg\/day, n = 166) versus placebo (flexibly dosed, n = 51; fixed dose, n = 52). The effects of treatment on the 58 ABC items were evaluated. Statistically significantly greater improvement was seen with aripiprazole versus placebo (p < 0.05) for all arms in both trials on the ABC-Irritability total subscale score and on the following individual ABC-Irritability items: Mood changes quickly, cries\/screams inappropriately, and stamps feet\/bangs objects. Several additional items measuring tantrum-like behaviors improved in the flexibly dosed trial and at least one arm of the fixed-dose trial (p < 0.05). Measures of self-injurious behavior, which had low baseline values, demonstrated numerical, but not statistically significant, improvement in both trials. Statistically significantly greater improvement in ABC Stereotypic Behavior and Hyperactivity total subscale scores was also consistent across all arms in both trials. In particular, there was a cluster of items related to hyperkinesis that were consistently sensitive to treatment. Aripiprazole is efficacious in the treatment of irritability in children and adolescents with autistic disorder, particularly with respect to symptoms associated with tantrum behavior.","27":"The authors evaluated the efficacy and safety of adjunctive aripiprazole in bipolar I patients with mania partially nonresponsive to lithium\/valproate monotherapy. This multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study included outpatients experiencing a manic or mixed episode (with or without psychotic features). Patients with partial nonresponse to lithium\/valproate monotherapy (defined as a Young Mania Rating Scale total score >\/=16 at the end of phases 1 and 2, with a decrease of <\/=25% between phases) with target serum concentrations of lithium (0.6-1.0 mmol\/liter) or valproate (50-125 mug\/ml) were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to adjunctive aripiprazole (N=253; 15 or 30 mg\/day) or placebo (N=131) for 6 weeks. Mean improvement from baseline in Young Mania Rating Scale total score at week 6 (primary endpoint) was significantly greater with aripiprazole (-13.3) than with placebo (-10.7). Significant improvements in Young Mania Rating Scale total score with aripiprazole versus placebo occurred from week 1 onward. In addition, the mean improvement in Clinical Global Impression Bipolar Version (CGI-BP) severity of illness (mania) score from baseline to week 6 was significantly greater with aripiprazole (-1.9) than with placebo (-1.6). Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were higher with aripiprazole than with placebo (9% versus 5%, respectively). Akathisia was the most frequently reported extrapyramidal symptom-related adverse event and occurred significantly more frequently among those receiving aripiprazole (18.6%) than among those receiving placebo (5.4%). There were no significant differences between treatments in weight change from baseline to week 6 (+0.55 kg and +0.23 kg for aripiprazole and placebo, respectively; last observation carried forward). Adjunctive aripiprazole therapy showed significant improvements in mania symptoms as early as week 1 and demonstrated a tolerability profile similar to that of monotherapy studies.","28":"Although most treatment research on bipolar disorder has focused on mania, depressive episodes occur more frequently among patients with bipolar disorder. Here, we report the results of 2 identically designed, 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (CN138-096 and CN138-146) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole monotherapy in outpatients with bipolar I disorder experiencing a major depressive episode without psychotic features. Patients were randomized to placebo or aripiprazole (initiated at 10 mg\/d, then flexibly dosed at 5-30 mg\/d based on clinical effect and tolerability). The primary end point was mean change from baseline to Week 8 (last observation carried forward) in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale total score. In Studies 1 and 2, respectively, 186 and 187 patients were randomized to aripiprazole, and 188 and 188 to placebo. Although statistically significant differences were observed during Weeks 1 to 6, aripiprazole did not achieve statistical significance versus placebo at Week 8 in either study in the change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale total (primary end point). In addition, despite early statistical separation on the Clinical Global Impressions Bipolar Version Severity of Illness-Depression score (key secondary end point), aripiprazole was not superior to placebo at end point. Aripiprazole was associated with a higher incidence of akathisia, insomnia, nausea, fatigue, restlessness, and dry mouth versus placebo. More patients discontinued with aripiprazole versus placebo in Study 1 (46.8% vs 35.1%) and Study 2 (41.2% vs 29.8%). Aripiprazole monotherapy-as dosed in this study design-was not significantly more effective than placebo in the treatment of bipolar depression at end point (Week 8).","29":"Cognitive deficits are a core feature of schizophrenia. As a target of intervention, improvements in cognition may lead to improvements in functional outcome. The present paper is the first report, to our knowledge, on the neurocognitive effects of aripiprazole. Unlike other second-generation antipsychotics, aripiprazole is a D(2) and D(3) receptor partial agonist. It is unknown what effects this unusual pharmacological profile may yield on neurocognition. The present open-label study included data on 169 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were randomly treated with aripiprazole or olanzapine. Subjects received a neurocognitive battery at baseline, week 8, and 26. The aripiprazole group had a significantly greater dropout rate than the olanzapine group. Neurocognitive data were reduced through a principal components analysis that yielded a three-factor solution. The factors were general cognitive functioning, executive functioning, and verbal learning. For general cognitive functioning, both groups improved from baseline and the effects were relatively stable over the 26-week protocol. There were no differential treatment effects. For executive functioning, neither group improved significantly from baseline. For verbal learning, the aripiprazole group improved significantly from baseline to the 8th and 26th week of assessment, and there was a between-group effect favoring aripiprazole over olanzapine that was largely attributable to the differences in performance within the 8th week. Separate analyses were conducted for a measure of sustained attention (Continuous Performance Test-Identical Pairs). There were no differential treatment effects on this measure. The findings from this open-label study suggest that the neurocognitive effects of aripiprazole are at least as good as those of olanzapine.","30":"The objective of this trial, Biomarkers in Autism of Aripiprazole and Risperidone Treatment (BAART), was to provide support and guidance for an evidence-based approach for the selection and monitoring of initial pharmacotherapy in patients with autism by assessing predictors of efficacy, tolerability, and safety. This randomized double-blind parallel-group study was conducted in three academic medical centers and a single private pediatric practice. Eighty children or adolescents (aged 6-17\u00a0yrs) with autistic disorder were enrolled, and 61 patients were randomized to the study drug. Of those patients, 51 completed the 10-week trial, and 31 completed an optional 12-week blinded extension phase. All patients were treated with 2\u00a0weeks of placebo before random assignment to receive aripiprazole (31 patients) or risperidone (30 patients) for 10\u00a0weeks. Sixteen placebo responders (20%) were excluded from further analysis. Drug dosing followed U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling, and weekly dosage adjustments were allowed until week 4; patients were then maintained on a fixed dose for 6 additional weeks. Safety, physical, and psychological assessments were recorded weekly or every 2 weeks. No significant differences in severity of illness between the aripiprazole and risperidone groups were noted at baseline. All patients significantly improved on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability subscale after 1 week and continued for the remaining 9\u00a0weeks and the extension phase. Improvement was greatest in the risperidone group at every assessment period and was statistically significantly better than that in the aripiprazole group at weeks 3 and 6 (p<0.05). No dose-limiting adverse events occurred during the dose-titration period. Mean weight gain in the aripiprazole group was significantly less than that in the risperidone group at week 4 (0.62 vs 1.38\u00a0kg, p=0.033) and week 10 (1.61 vs 3.31\u00a0kg, p<0.001), but the difference became nonsignificant for the 31 patients completing the 3-month extension phase (4.36 vs 5.55\u00a0kg, p=0.26). Pharmacotherapy of patients with autism spectrum disorder resulted in behavioral improvement within 1 week and lasted at least 22\u00a0weeks. Weight gain occurred to a greater degree with risperidone than aripiprazole initially, but the differences became nonsignificant by the end of the trial. Our trial supports previous results of drug efficacy and safety in patients with autism spectrum disorder from other trials and extends the evidence-based support for choosing an FDA-approved drug for initial pharmacotherapy for autism spectrum disorder.","31":"Abstract Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the short-term treatment effects of atomoxetine on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms in children and adolescents with both ASD and attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A total of 97 patients 6-17 years of age, with ASD and ADHD, were treated with 1.2\u2009mg\/kg\/day of atomoxetine during an 8 week double-blind placebo-controlled period. Here, we investigated effects on two parent-based secondary outcome measures, the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and the Children's Social Behavior Questionnaire (CSBQ). After 8 weeks of double-blind treatment, atomoxetine administration was associated with significant treatment effects on the ABC subscales Hyperactivity, Inappropriate Speech, and Stereotypic Behavior, and on the CSBQ subscale Fear for Changes. Our study results indicate no beneficial effects of atomoxetine on social functioning. However, atomoxetine may ameliorate restricted and stereotyped behaviors and communication.

In this study, 88 patients 6-17 years of age, with ADHD and ASD, were treated with 1.2 mg\/kg\/day atomoxetine for 20 weeks as follow-up of an 8 week double-blind placebo-controlled period. Primary endpoint was the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS). After 8 weeks of initial treatment, the mean total, inattention, and hyperactivity-impulsivity ADHD-RS further decreased significantly from 34.9 to 27.0 for the total ADHD-RS, from 18.3 to 14.5 for the ADHD-RS inattention subscale, and from 16.5 to 12.6 for the hyperactivity-impulsivity subscale. Adverse events were mild and tended to diminish over time during continued treatment, especially regarding nausea and fatigue. There were no serious adverse events. The results of the present analysis suggest that continued treatment with atomoxetine up to 28 weeks further improve ADHD symptoms in children and adolescents with ASD, while adverse events tend to subside. Future studies investigating the long-term efficacy of atomoxetine in children and adolescents with ASD should be randomized and placebo controlled.

The primary endpoint was the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) score; secondary endpoints were the Clinical Global Impression of ADHD-Improvement (CGI-I) and the Conners Teacher Rating Scale-Revised: Short Form (CTRS-R:S) score. Baseline mean ADHD-RS scores for atomoxetine versus placebo were 40.7 and 38.6; after 8 weeks, mixed-effect model repeated-measure means were 31.6 (95% confidence interval 29.2-33.9) and 38.3 (36.0-40.6), respectively, with a difference in least square means of -6.7 (-10.0 to -3.4; p < .001). The CTRS-R:S Hyperactivity subscore also improved significantly for atomoxetine compared with placebo, but not the other CTRS-R:S subscores. However, there were not significantly more patients on atomoxetine (20.9%) who improved much, or very much according to the CGI-I, than on placebo (8.7%; p = 0.14). Adverse events (mostly nausea, decrease in appetite, fatigue, and early morning awakening) were reported in 81.3% of atomoxetine patients and 65.3% of placebo patients (p > .1). There were no serious adverse events. Atomoxetine moderately improved ADHD symptoms in patients with ASD and was generally well tolerated.

In a 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 design, 128 children with ASD and attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were randomly assigned ATX, PT+placebo, PT+ATX, or placebo alone. PT was weekly for 10 weeks, and then monthly. ATX\/placebo was titrated over 6 weeks [\u22641.8\u2009mg\/kg\/d], and then maintained until week 10. Responders continued to week 34 or nonresponse. Placebo nonresponders had a 10-week ATX open trial; ATX nonresponders were treated clinically. All continued to week 34. With no further treatment from the study, all were invited to follow-up (FU) at 1.5 years postbaseline; 94 (73%) participated. Changes from Week 34 to FU and from baseline to FU were tested by one-way analysis of variance or chi-squared test. PT versus no PT was tested by chi-squared test, Fisher's exact test, Welch's t-test, Student's t-test, and Mann-Whitney's U test. For the whole sample, the primary outcomes (parent-rated ADHD on the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham [SNAP] scale and noncompliance on the Home Situations Questionnaire [HSQ]) deteriorated mildly from week 34 to FU, but were still substantially better than baseline (SNAP: t\u2009=\u200912.177, df\u2009=\u200993, p\u2009<\u20090.001; HSQ: t\u2009=\u20098.999, df\u2009=\u200993, p\u2009<\u20090.001). On the SNAP, 61% improved \u226530% from baseline (67% did at week 34); on noncompliance, 56% improved \u226530% from baseline (77% did at week 34). Outcomes with PT were not significantly better than without PT (SNAP p\u2009=\u20090.30; HSQ p\u2009=\u20090.27). Originally assigned treatment groups did not differ significantly. Only 34% still took ATX; 27% were taking stimulants; and 25% took no medication. The majority retained their 34-week end-of-study improvement 10 months later, even though most participants stopped ATX. For some children, ATX continuation may not be necessary for continued benefit or other drugs may be necessary. Cautious individual clinical experimentation may be justified. Twelve sessions of PT made little long-term difference.

Psychostimulant medications used to treat ADHD symptoms can exacerbate this problem. For children with ASD and ADHD, atomoxetine (ATX) is a viable alternative to psychostimulants. We investigated the effects of ATX and a manualized parent training (PT) program targeting noncompliance, on the sleep quality of children with ASD and ADHD. Participants in a randomized clinical trial were treated with ATX + PT, ATX alone, PT alone, or placebo (PBO) alone, for 10 weeks. Fifty-four of 128 (42%) caregivers completed the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) at baseline and endpoint. Analysis of covariance was used to investigate possible differences between treatment groups. There were no significant differences between treatment groups, including PBO on the CSHQ 33-Item total score, total hours of sleep per day, and total minutes awake after sleep onset at the study endpoint. ATX appears sleep neutral. Clinicians who treat ADHD symptoms in children and adolescents with ASD may prefer ATX over psychostimulants when sleep disturbance is an issue.","37":"We previously reported a 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 randomized clinical trial of atomoxetine (ATX) and parent training (PT) for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms and behavioral noncompliance in 128 children with autism spectrum disorder, ages 5-14\u00a0years. Children were randomized to one of four conditions: ATX alone, placebo alone, ATX\u2009+\u2009PT, or PT\u2009+\u2009placebo. Both ATX and PT improved some indices of ADHD and behavioral compliance. In this report, we describe parent stress over time and across conditions. All four treatments improved parent self-rated stress from baseline to week 10.

We describe the rate and duration of adverse events in a randomized controlled trial of atomoxetine (ATX) and parent training (PT) for ADHD symptoms and noncompliance in children with ASD. We conducted a 10-week, double-blind, 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 trial of ATX and PT with 128 children (ages 5-14) randomized to ATX alone, ATX+PT, placebo+PT, or placebo alone. For 6 weeks, ATX (or placebo) doses were clinically adjusted to a maximum of 1.8\u2009mg\/(kg\u00b7day) and maintained for an additional 4 weeks. An average of seven PT sessions were conducted in the two PT arms. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed through parent ratings of common symptoms on a seven-point Likert severity scale and through direct interviews with study medical staff. ATX was associated with decreased appetite and fatigue, but was otherwise well tolerated. Most reported AEs lasted 4 weeks or less. Unlike reports with typically developing (TD) children, there were no concerns with QTc changes or suicidal ideation.

In the present report, they describe a 24-week extension of treatment responders and nonresponders. One-hundred seventeen participants from the acute trial (91%) entered the extension; 84 of these were in 2 subgroups: \"treatment responders\" (n\u00a0= 43) from all 4\u00a0groups in the acute trial, seen monthly for 24 weeks, and \"placebo nonresponders\" (n\u00a0= 41), treated with open-label ATX for 10 weeks. Participants originally assigned to PT continued PT during the extension; the remainder served as controls. Primary outcome measurements were the parent-rated Swanson, Nolan and Pelham ADHD scale and the Home Situations Questionnaire. Sixty percent (26 of 43) of treatment responders in the acute trial, including 68% of responders originally assigned to ATX, still met the response criteria at the end of the extension. The response rate of placebo nonresponders treated with 10-week open-label ATX was 37% (15 of 41), similar to the acute trial. Children receiving open-label ATX\u00a0+ PT were significantly more likely to be ADHD responders (53% versus 23%) and noncompliance responders (58% versus 14%) than those receiving open-label ATX alone. Most ATX responders maintained their responses during the extension. PT combined with ATX in the open-label trial appeared to improve ADHD and noncompliance outcomes more than ATX alone.

The Children with Hyperactivity and Autism Research Treatment Study (CHARTS) randomly assigned 128 children 5.00-14.11 years of age to four treatment groups (ATX + PT, ATX alone, PT + placebo[PBO], and PBO). Caregivers completed an 18 item questionnaire about their satisfaction with the research experience. We summarized caregiver responses with descriptive statistics and examined whether the responses were associated with demographic variables, treatment assignment, or the child's response to treatment (positive or negative). Ninety-three percent of caregivers (119) completed the questionnaire. When asked if they would join the study again if given the chance, 87% (103) responded \"yes,\" 13% (15) responded \"maybe,\" and 1% (1) responded \"no.\" When asked if they would recommend the study to other caregivers of children with similar problems, 92% (109) responded \"yes\" and 8% responded (10) \"maybe.\" Of the 59 Parent Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ) respondents who received PT, 75% (44) felt more confident in managing current child behaviors, 24% (14) felt that their level of confidence was unchanged, and 2% (1) felt less confident. Most caregivers expressed satisfaction with the study procedures, including the number of visits and the safety monitoring protocols.

However, ADHD response to stimulants is well below rates in typically developing children, with frequent side effects. Group studies of treatments for noncompliance are rare in ASD. We examined individual and combined-effectiveness of atomoxetine (ATX) and parent training (PT) for ADHD symptoms and noncompliance. In a 3-site, 10-week, double-blind, 2 \u00d7 2 trial of ATX and PT, 128 children (ages 5-14 years) with ASD and ADHD symptoms were randomized to ATX, ATX+PT, placebo+PT, or placebo. ATX was adjusted to optimal dose (capped at 1.8 mg\/kg\/day) over 6 weeks and maintained for 4 additional weeks. Nine PT sessions were provided. Primary outcome measures were the parent-rated DSM ADHD symptoms on the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham (SNAP) scale and Home Situations Questionnaire (HSQ). On the SNAP, ATX, ATX+PT and placebo+PT were each superior to placebo (effect sizes 0.57-0.98; p values of .0005, .0004, and .025, respectively). For noncompliance, ATX and ATX+PT were superior to placebo (effect sizes 0.47-0.64; p values .03 and .0028, respectively). ATX was associated with decreased appetite but was otherwise well tolerated. Both ATX and PT resulted in significant improvement on ADHD symptoms, whereas ATX (both alone and combined with PT) was associated with significant decreases on measures of noncompliance. ATX appears to have a better side effects profile than psychostimulants in the population with ASD.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of balovaptan, an oral selective vasopressin 1a receptor antagonist, compared with placebo in children and adolescents with ASD. The aV1ation study was a randomized, double-blind, 24-week, parallel-group, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial. Between November 22, 2016, and September 3, 2019, individuals were screened and randomly assigned to treatment groups. The primary efficacy analysis population comprised participants taking age-adjusted balovaptan equivalent to a 10-mg adult dose and participants from the concurrently randomized placebo group. This multicenter trial took place across 41 sites in the US. Participants were aged 5 to 17 years with diagnosed ASD and an IQ of 70 or greater. Data were analyzed from April 8 to November 16, 2020. Participants were randomly assigned to daily 4-mg or 10-mg adult-equivalent balovaptan or placebo, until the 4-mg group was discontinued. The primary end point was change from baseline on the Vineland-II two-domain composite (2DC; socialization and communication domains) score at week 24. Between November 2016 and September 2019, a total of 599 individuals were screened and 339 participants were randomly assigned to receive 4-mg balovaptan adult-equivalent dose (91 [26.8%]), 10-mg balovaptan adult-equivalent dose (126 [37.2%]), or placebo (122 [36.0%]). Primary analysis included 86 participants assigned to receive 10-mg balovaptan adult-equivalent dose and 81 assigned to receive placebo (mean [SD] age, 12.1 [3.4] years; 139 male participants [83.2%]). No statistically significant differences were observed between the balovaptan and placebo groups in change from baseline on the Vineland-II 2DC score at week 24 (difference in adjusted least-squares mean, -0.16; 90% CI, -2.56 to 2.23; P\u2009=\u2009.91). No improvements for balovaptan vs placebo were observed at week 24 for any secondary end points. Balovaptan was well tolerated with no emerging safety concerns. Similar proportions of participants reported adverse events (balovaptan, 66 of 86 [76.7%] vs placebo, 61 of 81 [75.3%]) and serious adverse events (balovaptan, 1 of 86 [1.2%] vs placebo, 4 of 81 [4.9%]). In this randomized clinical trial, balovaptan did not demonstrate efficacy in improvement of socialization and communication in this population with pediatric ASD. Balovaptan was well tolerated in children 5 years or older. Further development of robust, sensitive, and objective outcome measures may help to improve future studies in the assessment of therapies targeting communication and socialization in pediatric ASD.

Here, in a proof of concept pilot study, we demonstrate that administration of bumetanide (a NKCC1 chloride importer antagonist that restores GABAergic inhibition) normalizes the level of amygdala activation during constrained eye contact with dynamic emotional face stimuli in autism. In addition, eye-tracking data reveal that bumetanide administration increases the time spent in spontaneous eye gaze during in a free-viewing mode of the same face stimuli. In keeping with clinical trials, our data support the Excitatory\/Inhibitory dysfunction hypothesis in autism, and indicate that bumetanide may improve specific aspects of social processing in autism. Future double-blind placebo controlled studies with larger cohorts of participants will help clarify the mechanisms of bumetanide action in autism.","44":"In animal models of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the NKCC1 chloride-importer inhibitor bumetanide restores physiological (Cl<sup>-<\/sup>)<sub>i<\/sub> levels, enhances GABAergic inhibition and attenuates electrical and behavioral symptoms of ASD. In an earlier phase 2 trial; bumetanide reduced the severity of ASD in children and adolescents (3-11 years old). Here we report the results of a multicenter phase 2B study primarily to assess dose\/response and safety effects of bumetanide. Efficacy outcome measures included the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), the Social Responsive Scale (SRS) and the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Improvement scale (CGI-I). Eighty-eight patients with ASD spanning across the entire pediatric population (2-18 years old) were subdivided in four age groups and randomized to receive bumetanide (0.5, 1.0 or 2.0\u2009mg twice daily) or placebo for 3 months. The mean CARS value was significantly improved in the completers group (P: 0.015). Also, 23 treated children had more than a six-point improvement in the CARS compared with only one placebo-treated individual. Bumetanide significantly improved CGI (P: 0.0043) and the SRS score by more than 10 points (P: 0.02). The most frequent adverse events were hypokalemia, increased urine elimination, loss of appetite, dehydration and asthenia. Hypokalemia occurred mainly at the beginning of the treatment at 1.0 and 2.0\u2009mg twice-daily doses and improved gradually with oral potassium supplements. The frequency and incidence of adverse event were directly correlated with the dose of bumetanide. Therefore, bumetanide improves the core symptoms of ASD and presents a favorable benefit\/risk ratio particularly at 1.0\u2009mg twice daily.","45":"Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated synapses and the oscillations they orchestrate are altered in autism. GABA-acting benzodiazepines exert in some patients with autism paradoxical effects, raising the possibility that like in epilepsies, GABA excites neurons because of elevated intracellular concentrations of chloride. Following a successful pilot study,(1) we have now performed a double-blind clinical trial using the diuretic, chloride-importer antagonist bumetanide that reduces intracellular chloride reinforcing GABAergic inhibition. Sixty children with autism or Asperger syndrome (3-11 years old) received for 3 months placebo or bumetanide (1 mg daily), followed by 1-month wash out. Determination of the severity of autism was made with video films at day 0 (D0) and D90 by blind, independent evaluators. Bumetanide reduced significantly the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) (D90-D0; P<0.004 treated vs placebo), Clinical Global Impressions (P<0.017 treated vs placebo) and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule values when the most severe cases (CARS values above the mean \u00b1 s.d.; n=9) were removed (Wilcoxon test: P-value=0.031; Student's t-test: P-value=0.017). Side effects were restricted to an occasional mild hypokalaemia (3.0-3.5 mM\u2009l(-1) K(+)) that was treated with supplemental potassium. In a companion study, chronic bumetanide treatment significantly improved accuracy in facial emotional labelling, and increased brain activation in areas involved in social and emotional perception (Hadjikhani et al., submitted). Therefore, bumetanide is a promising novel therapeutic agent to treat autism. Larger trials are warranted to better determine the population best suited for this treatment.","46":"With the current limited drug therapy for the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), we herein report a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy, safety, and potential neural mechanism of bumetanide in children with ASD aged 3-6\u00a0years old. A total of 120 children were enrolled into the study and randomly assigned to either 0.5\u00a0mg bumetanide or placebo. In the final sample, 119 children received at least one dose of bumetanide (59 children) or placebo (60 children) were included in the final analysis. The primary outcome was a reduction in the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) score, and the secondary outcomes were the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI) -Global Improvement (CGI-I) score at 3\u00a0months and the change from baseline to 3-month in the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to measure \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate neurotransmitter concentrations in the insular cortex (IC) before and after the treatment. As compared with the placebo, bumetanide treatment was significantly better in reducing the severity. No patient withdrew from the trial due to adverse events. The superiority of bumetanide to placebo in reducing insular GABA, measured using MRS, was demonstrated. The clinical improvement was associated with a decrease in insular GABA in the bumetanide group. In conclusion, this trial in a large group of young children with predominantly moderate and severe ASD demonstrated that bumetanide is safe and effective in improving the core symptoms of ASD. However, the clinical significance remains uncertain, and future multi-center clinical trials are required to replicate these findings and confirm the clinical significance using a variety of outcome measures.","47":"Bumetanide has been reported to alter synaptic excitation-inhibition (E-I) balance by potentiating the action of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), thereby attenuating the severity of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in animal models. However, clinical evidence of its efficacy in young patients with ASD is limited. This was investigated in the present clinical trial of 83 patients, randomised to the bumetanide group (bumetanide treatment, 0.5\u2009mg twice daily) or the control group (no bumetanide treatment). Primary [Children Autism Rating Scale (CARS)], secondary [Clinical Global Impressions (CGI)], and exploratory [inhibitory (\u03b3-aminobutyric acid, GABA) and excitatory (glutamate, Glx) neurotransmitter concentrations measured in the insular cortex (IC) and visual cortex (VC) by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)] outcome measures were evaluated at baseline and at the 3-month follow-up. Side effects were monitored throughout the treatment course. Compared with the control group, the bumetanide group showed significant reduction in symptom severity, as indicated by both total CARS score and number of items assigned a score\u2009\u2265\u20093. The improvement in clinical symptoms was confirmed by CGI. GABA\/Glx ratio in both the IC and VC decreased more rapidly over the 3-month period in the bumetanide group than that in the control group. This decrease in the IC was associated with the symptom improvement in the bumetanide group. Our study confirmed the clinical efficacy of bumetanide on alleviating the core symptoms of ASD in young children and it is the first demonstration that the improvement is associated with reduction in GABA\/Glx ratios. This study suggests that the GABA\/Glx ratio measured by MRS may provide a neuroimaging biomarker for assessing treatment efficacy for bumetanide.","48":"We present the secondary-analysis of neurocognitive tests in the 'Bumetanide in Autism Medication and Biomarker' (BAMBI;EUDRA-CT-2014-001560-35) study, a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled (1:1) trial testing 3-months bumetanide treatment (\u2264\u20091\u00a0mg twice-daily) in unmedicated children 7-15 years with ASD. Children with IQ\u2009\u2265\u200970 were analyzed for baseline deficits and treatment-effects on the intention-to-treat-population with generalized-linear-models, principal component analysis and network analysis. Ninety-two children were allocated to treatment and 83 eligible for analyses. Heterogeneous neurocognitive impairments were found that were unaffected by bumetanide treatment.

We recently reported beneficial effects on repetitive behavioral symptoms that might be related to regulating excitation-inhibition (E\/I) balance in the brain. Here, we tested the neurophysiological effects of bumetanide and the relationship to clinical outcome variability and investigated the potential for machine learning-based predictions of meaningful clinical improvement. Using modified linear mixed models applied to intention-to-treat population, we analyzed E\/I-sensitive electroencephalography (EEG) measures before and after 91 days of treatment in the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Bumetanide in Autism Medication and Biomarker study. Resting-state EEG of 82 subjects out of 92 participants (7-15 years) were available. Alpha frequency band absolute and relative power, central frequency, long-range temporal correlations, and functional E\/I ratio treatment effects were related to the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) and the Social Responsiveness Scale 2 as clinical outcomes. We observed superior bumetanide effects on EEG, reflected in increased absolute and relative alpha power and functional E\/I ratio and in decreased central frequency. Associations between EEG and clinical outcome change were restricted to subgroups with medium to high RBS-R improvement. Using machine learning, medium and high RBS-R improvement could be predicted by baseline RBS-R score and EEG measures with 80% and 92% accuracy, respectively. Bumetanide exerts neurophysiological effects related to clinical changes in more responsive subsets, in whom prediction of improvement was feasible through EEG and clinical measures.","50":"Recent trials have indicated positive effects of bumetanide in autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Unmedicated children aged 7 to 15 years with ASD and IQ \u226555 were block-randomized 1:1 to oral-solution bumetanide versus placebo, titrated to a maximum of 1.0 mg twice daily for 91 days (D91), followed by a 28-day wash-out period. The primary outcome was difference in Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2) total score at D91, analyzed by modified intention-to-treat with linear mixed models. A total of 92 participants (mean age 10.5 [SD 2.4] years) enrolled between June 2016 and December 2018. In all, 47 children were allocated to bumetanide and 45 to placebo. Two participants dropped out per treatment arm.

TSC is strongly associated with broad neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder symptomatology. Preclinical TSC studies have indicated altered neuronal chloride homeostasis affecting the polarity of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) ergic transmission as a potential treatment target. Bumetanide, a selective NKCC1 chloride importer antagonist, may attenuate depolarizing GABA action, and in that way reduce disease burden. In this open-label pilot study, we tested the effect of bumetanide on a variety of neurophysiological, cognitive, and behavioral measures in children with TSC. Participants were treated with bumetanide (2dd 0.5-1.0\u2009mg) for 13\u2009weeks in an open-label trial. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability (ABC-I) subscale was chosen as the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included other behavioral questionnaires in addition to event-related potentials (ERP) and neuropsychological tests if tolerated. Additionally, the treatment effect on seizure frequency and quality of life was assessed. Endpoint data were collected at baseline, after 91\u2009days of treatment and after a 28-day wash-out period. Fifteen patients (8-21-years old) with TSC were included of which 13 patients completed the study. Treatment was well-tolerated with only expected adverse events due to the diuretic effects of bumetanide. Irritable behavior (ABC-I) showed significant improvement after treatment in 11 out of 13 patients (t(12) = 4.41, p = .001, d = .773). A favorable effect was also found for social behavior (Social Responsiveness Scale) (t(11) = 4.01, p = .002, d = .549) and hyperactive behavior (ABC-hyperactivity subscale) (t(12) = 3.65, p = .003, d = .686). Moreover, patients rated their own health-related quality of life higher after treatment. At baseline, TSC patients showed several atypical ERPs versus typically developing peers of which prepulse inhibition was significantly decreased in the TSC group. Neuropsychological measurements showed no change and bumetanide had no effect on seizure frequency. The sample size and open-label design of this pilot study warrant caution when interpreting outcome measures. Bumetanide treatment is a potential treatment to alleviate the behavioral burden and quality of life associated with TSC.

Children 2-6 years of age with ASD (N = 166) were randomized to receive placebo or 2.5 or 5.0 mg of buspirone twice daily. The primary objective was to evaluate the effects of 24 weeks of buspirone on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) Composite Total Score. Secondary objectives included evaluating the effects of buspirone on social competence, repetitive behaviors, language, sensory dysfunction, and anxiety and to assess side effects. Positron emission tomography measures of tryptophan metabolism and blood serotonin concentrations were assessed as predictors of buspirone efficacy. There was no difference in the ADOS Composite Total Score between baseline and 24 weeks among the 3 treatment groups (P = .400); however, the ADOS Restricted and Repetitive Behavior score showed a time-by-treatment effect (P = .006); the 2.5-mg buspirone group showed significant improvement (P = .003), whereas placebo and 5.0-mg buspirone groups showed no change. Children in the 2.5-mg buspirone group were more likely to improve if they had fewer foci of increased brain tryptophan metabolism on positron emission tomography (P = .018) or if they showed normal levels of blood serotonin (P = .044).

Autistic children (13 boys, 7 girls) were given a single oral dose of 2.5 mg (2-3 years) or 5.0 mg (4-6 years). Blood was collected for 8 hours, and plasma was assayed for buspirone and its metabolite 1-pyrimidinylpiperazine (1-PP). The peak concentration of buspirone averaged 1141 +\/- 748 pg\/mL with a time to maximum concentration of 0.8 hours. Half-life was 1.6 +\/- 0.3 hours. Peak concentrations of 1-PP were 4.5-fold higher than for buspirone. Girls had higher peak concentrations (1876 vs 746 pg\/mL) for buspirone and a lower peak 1-PP\/buspirone concentration ratio. These results suggest that buspirone is rapidly absorbed and eliminated in young children with extensive metabolism to 1-PP.

Twelve weeks of treatment with citalopram (10 mg\/5 mL) or placebo. The mean (SD) maximum dose of citalopram was 16.5 (6.5) mg by mouth daily (maximum dose, 20 mg\/d). A positive response was defined as having a score of at least much improved on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale at week 12. Baseline measures included demographic (sex, age, weight, and pubertal status), clinical, and family measures. Clinical variables included baseline illness severity ratings (the Aberrant Behavior Checklist, the Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised, and the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale). Family measures included the Caregiver Strain Questionnaire. Several baseline predictors of response were identified, and a principal component analysis yielded 3 composite measures (disruptive behavior, autism\/mood, and caregiver strain) that significantly predicted response at week 12. Specifically, participants in the placebo group were significantly less likely than participants in the citalopram group to respond at week 12 if they entered the study more symptomatic on each of the 3 composite measures, and they were at least 2 times less likely to be responders.

Fifty-two outpatients with DSM-IV borderline personality disorder were randomly assigned to receive divalproex (N=20) or placebo (N=32), double-blind, for 12 weeks. Trait impulsivity symptoms were determined by using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, and state aggression symptoms were determined by using the Overt Aggression Scale modified for outpatients. Affective stability was determined by using the Young Mania Rating Scale and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Analyses were performed to identify possible baseline symptom domains that predict treatment response. Divalproex was superior to placebo in reducing impulsive aggression in patients with borderline personality disorder. Divalproex-treated patients responded better than placebo-treated patients among those with higher baseline trait impulsivity symptoms and state aggression symptoms. The effects of baseline trait impulsivity and state aggression appear to be independent of one another. However, baseline affective instability did not influence differential treatment response. Both pretreatment trait impulsivity symptoms and state aggression symptoms predict a favorable response to divalproex relative to placebo for impulsive aggression in patients with borderline personality disorder.","66":"Impulsive aggressive behavior is common in psychiatric disorders and accounts for significant morbidity and mortality. However, little systematic treatment data exist from placebo-controlled trials for this symptom domain. This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which outpatients with a score of > or =15 on the Aggression scale of the Overt Aggression Scale-Modified (OAS-M) and who fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for Cluster B personality disorder (n=96), intermittent explosive disorder (n=116), or post-traumatic stress disorder (n=34) were randomized to divalproex sodium or placebo for 12 weeks duration. Based on average OAS-M Aggression scores over the last 4 weeks of treatment, a treatment effect was not observed in the intent-to-treat data set (combined across the three psychiatric disorders), but was observed in both intent-to-treat and evaluable data sets for patients with Cluster B personality disorders. In the Cluster B evaluable data set, statistically significant treatment differences favoring divalproex were also observed for component items of the OAS-M Aggression score, including verbal assault and assault against objects, as well as OAS-M Irritability score, and Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-Severity at multiple time points throughout the study. No treatment group difference was noted for overall premature discontinuation rate; however, across psychiatric diagnoses, 21 (17%) patients in the divalproex group prematurely discontinued because of an adverse event, as compared to 4 (3%) patients in the placebo group (p <0.001). While a treatment effect was not observed when all diagnostic groups were combined, in a large subgroup of patients with Cluster B disorders, divalproex was superior to placebo in the treatment of impulsive aggression, irritability, and global severity.","67":"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lithium and valproate in nonbipolar pathological gamblers. Forty-two subjects with DSM-IV-defined pathological gambling entered a 14-week single-blind trial with lithium (N = 23) or valproate (N = 19). A total of 15 subjects on lithium treatment and 16 patients on valproate treatment completed the 14-week protocol. At the end of the 14-week treatment period, both the lithium and the valproate groups showed significant (p <.01) improvement in mean score on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for pathological gambling. This improvement did not significantly differ between groups. Fourteen (60.9%) of the 23 patients taking lithium and 13 (68.4%) of the 19 patients taking valproate were responders based on a Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement score of much or very much improved. Findings from the present study suggest the efficacy of both lithium carbonate and valproate in the treatment of pathological gambling. This is the first controlled trial of the efficacy of mood stabilizers in pathological gambling. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is required to confirm these findings.","68":"Autism spectrum disorders are characterized by core deficits in social interaction and speech\/communication skills, repetitive behaviors, and restricted interests. Other abnormalities include seizures, electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities, affective instability, impulsivity, and aggression. Divalproex sodium is indicated as both an anticonvulsant in epilepsy and a mood stabilizer in bipolar illness and thus might be useful for these complicating symptoms in autism. A retrospective pilot study was conducted to determine whether divalproex sodium was effective in treating core dimensions and associated features of autism. Fourteen patients who met DSM-IV criteria for autism, Asperger's disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, both with and without a history of seizure disorders or EEG abnormalities, were openly treated with divalproex sodium. Improvement was assessed via the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale. Of 14 patients who completed a trial of divalproex sodium, 10 (71%) were rated as having sustained response to treatment. The mean dose of divalproex sodium was 768 mg\/day (range, 125-2500 mg\/day), and it was generally well tolerated. Improvement was noted in core symptoms of autism and associated features of affective instability, impulsivity, and aggression. Divalproex sodium may be beneficial to patients with autism spectrum disorders, particularly those with associated features of affective instability, impulsivity, and aggression as well as those with a history of EEG abnormalities or seizures. Of note, all patients with an abnormal EEG and\/or seizure history were rated as responders. However, these findings must be interpreted with caution, given the open retrospective nature of the study. Controlled trials are needed to replicate these preliminary findings.","69":"Borderline personality disorder is characterized by affective instability, impulsivity, and aggression and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Since anticonvulsant agents may be helpful in such symptomatology, we compared divalproex sodium with placebo in patients with borderline personality disorder. A 10-week, parallel, double-blind design was conducted. Sixteen outpatients meeting Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders criteria for borderline personality disorder were randomly assigned to receive placebo (N = 4) or divalproex sodium (N = 12). Change was assessed in global symptom severity (Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement Scale [CGI-I]) and functioning (Global Assessment Scale [GAS]) as well as in specific core symptoms (depression, aggression, irritability, and suicidality). There was significant improvement from baseline in both global measures (CGI-I and GAS) following divalproex sodium treatment. A high dropout rate precluded finding significant differences between the treatment groups in the intent-to-treat analyses, although all results were in the predicted direction. Treatment with divalproex sodium may be more effective than placebo for global symptomatology, level of functioning, aggression, and depression. Controlled trials with larger sample sizes are warranted to confirm these preliminary results.","70":"Target symptoms in pharmacotherapy of borderline personality disorder include mood instability, anxiety, and impulsivity. Valproate appears useful for the treatment of these target symptoms in several disorders, and carbamazepine has been found effective for such symptoms in borderline personality disorder. We therefore conducted a preliminary open-label trial of valproate in borderline personality disorder. Eleven patients who met DSM-III-R criteria for borderline personality disorder were entered into an 8-week study of valproate. Exclusion criteria included current major depression or major medical disorder. All patients were in psychotherapy at least once a week for a minimum of 8 weeks prior to starting medication. Valproate was increased as tolerated to reach blood levels of 50 to 100 micrograms\/mL. Clinician- and self-rated scales were completed each week. Three patients did not complete the study. Of completers, 4 of 8 patients were responders (\"much less\" or \"less\") on clinician-rated change scores for overall pathology and for mood. Three of 8 patients were responders on change scores for anxiety, anger, impulsivity, and rejection sensitivity. There was a significant (p = .03) decrease in total Symptom Checklist-90 scores between the start and end of the trial. On the Overt Aggression Scale (Modified), total other-directed assault did not significantly decrease, but there was a significant (p = .02) decrease in global subjective irritability. Valproate led to overall improvement in 50% of a small sample of borderline personality disorder patients who completed an 8-week open trial. The medication was modestly helpful for mood and irritability as well as for anxiety, anger, rejection sensitivity, and impulsivity, but specific therapeutic effects varied from patient to patient. More extensive controlled trials of anticonvulsants for impulsive personality disorders are warranted.","71":"There has been recent interest in the use of cognitive enhancing drugs, such as cholinesterase inhibitors, as a possible treatment for executive functioning (EF) deficits in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The goal of this study was to assess the tolerability, safety, and efficacy of donepezil on EF in a sample of children and adolescents with ASD. Thirty-four children and adolescents with ASD (age range 8-17 years; IQ >75) were enrolled in a 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of donepezil (doses of 5 and 10\u2009mg), followed by a 10-week open label trial for placebo nonresponders. The effect of donepezil treatment on EF was examined. Despite improvement on a number of EF measures, no statistically significant between-group differences were found (with gains observed for both the placebo and donepezil groups). The results suggest that short-term treatment with donepezil may have limited impact on cognitive functioning in ASD. Future controlled trials may need to consider a longer treatment period to detect significant gains on EF measures.","72":"The objective of our study was to assess the efficacy and safety of donepezil in young adults with Down syndrome (DS) but no evidence of Alzheimer disease (AD). A 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a 12-week, open-label extension was conducted. The intervention consisted of donepezil (5-10 mg\/day) in young adults (aged 18-35 years) with DS, but no AD. The primary measure was the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) test and secondary measures were the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS), the Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test for Children, and the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals, Third Edition. At baseline, 123 subjects were randomly assigned treatment with donepezil or placebo. During the double-blind phase, SIB scores improved significantly from baseline in both groups, with no significant between-group differences. During the open-label phase, SIB scores in the original donepezil group remained stable; the original placebo group showed an improvement similar to that seen in the double-blind phase. VABS scores improved for donepezil, but not placebo, during the double-blind phase (observed cases, P = 0.03; last observation carried forward, P = 0.07). Post hoc responder analyses were significant for donepezil using three of five response definitions (P < or = 0.045). Adverse event rates were comparable to AD studies. In this first large-scale, multicenter trial of a pharmacological agent for DS, donepezil appears safe. Efficacy interpretation was limited for the primary measure due to apparent learning\/practice and ceiling effects. Outcomes in post hoc analyses suggested efficacy in some, but not all subjects, consistent with phenotypic variability of DS. Additional studies are required to confirm potential benefits of donepezil in this population.","73":"Fifteen children with autism were treated with 60 mg d,l-fenfluramine (FEN) or placebo in a double-blind A-B-A protocol followed immediately by double-blind placebo-controlled crossover administration of FEN (total duration 62 weeks). Both biochemical and clinical outcomes were examined. Biochemically, FEN led to an increase in dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and decreases in whole-blood serotonin (5-HT), plasma norepinephrine (NE), and plasma 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG). The decrease in whole-blood 5-HT was seen only during treatment with FEN. However, NE levels did not return to baseline as long as 8 weeks after the first FEN treatment period. Increases in DOPAC were greater during the second FEN treatment period than the first. Persistent changes in catecholamine regulation may be related to previously reported long-term effects on central nervous system 5-HT after FEN. Clinically, FEN led to a modest decrease in parent, but not teacher, ratings of hyperactivity and to a small reduction in sensorimotor abnormalities. Abnormal social and affectual responses also decreased, but this was not directly related to FEN treatment. Effects on cognition were equivocal. Hyperserotonemic subjects did not differ from normoserotonemic subjects in clinical response. Overall, no significant advantage for the use of FEN could be established.","74":"Modifications in serotonin and dopamine metabolism were evaluated in 13 children with autistic behavior and related to their responsiveness to fenfluramine treatment. A double-blind medication-placebo crossover design was used. Each patient received 1.5 mg\/kg fenfluramine daily for 3 months followed and preceded by placebo for 1 month. Clinical improvement was observed in 6 children (responders). It included reduction of behavioral symptoms such as motor activity, anxiety, mood disturbances, and distractibility. Modifications of serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and DA metabolites [homovanillic acid (HVA) and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC)] were assessed at urinary levels. Responders and nonresponders showed a significant decrease of urinary 5-HT levels on fenfluramine. The main differences between the two groups of subjects were found with HVA, the major metabolite of DA. Fenfluramine significantly increased HVA levels in responders whereas no significant modification was found in nonresponders. Moreover the initial level of HVA (lower in responders) significantly differentiated the two groups. These results suggest that the clinical response to fenfluramine could be related to the dopaminergic action of this drug and that urinary DA metabolite levels could be considered as indicators of the responsiveness to fenfluramine treatment in children with autistic behavior.","75":"Evoked potentials to auditory stimulations varying in intensity were studied in 13 children with autistic behavior treated with fenfluramine. Modifications of both amplitude and single-trial potential variability were considered according to the clinical and biochemical responsiveness to this drug. Six children (responders) were clinically improved by the treatment. Electrophysiological data were affected according to the clinical and biochemical responsiveness to fenfluramine: the auditory evoked potential amplitude increased, and the single-trial potential variability decreased at each intensity level only in responders whose dopaminergic metabolism was significantly modified by fenfluramine treatment. No modification was found in nonresponders. Both biochemical and electrophysiological results argued for an amphetamine-like action of fenfluramine in those autistic children whose attention deficits are associated with motor disturbances including hyperactivity.","76":"The effects of fluoxetine and placebo on repetitive behaviors and global severity were compared in adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Adults with ASDs were enrolled in a 12-week double-blind placebo-controlled fluoxetine trial. Thirty-seven were randomly assigned to fluoxetine (N=22) or placebo (N=15). Dosage followed a fixed schedule, starting at 10 mg\/day and increasing as tolerated up to 80 mg\/day. Repetitive behaviors were measured with the compulsion subscale of the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale; the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) improvement scale was used to rate improvement in obsessive-compulsive symptoms and overall severity. There was a significant treatment-by-time interaction indicating a significantly greater reduction in repetitive behaviors across time for fluoxetine than for placebo. With overall response defined as a CGI global improvement score of 2 or less, there were significantly more responders at week 12 in the fluoxetine group than in the placebo group. The risk ratio was 1.5 for CGI global improvement (responders: fluoxetine, 35%; placebo, 0%) and 1.8 for CGI-rated improvement in obsessive-compulsive symptoms (responders: fluoxetine, 50%; placebo, 8%). Only mild and moderate side effects were observed. Fluoxetine treatment, compared to placebo, resulted in significantly greater improvement in repetitive behaviors, according to both the Yale-Brown compulsion subscale and CGI rating of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, as well as on the CGI overall improvement rating. Fluoxetine appeared to be well tolerated. These findings stand in contrast to findings in a trial of citalopram for childhood autism.","77":"Repetitive behaviors are a core symptom domain in autism that has been linked to alterations in the serotonin system. While the selective serotonin-receptive inhibitor fluvoxamine has been shown to be effective in adults with autism, as yet no published placebo controlled trials with these agents document safety and efficacy in children with autism. This study examines the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor liquid fluoxetine in the treatment of repetitive behaviors in childhood and adolescent autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). In total, 45 child or adolescent patients with ASD were randomized into two acute 8-week phases in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study of liquid fluoxetine. Study design included two randomized 8-week fluoxetine and placebo phases separated by a 4-week washout phase. Outcome measures included measures of repetitive behaviors and global improvement. Low-dose liquid fluoxetine (mean final dose: 9.9+\/-4.35 mg\/day) was superior to placebo in the treatment of repetitive behaviors by CY-BOCS compulsion scale. The effect size was in the moderate to large range, and the doses used were low. Liquid fluoxetine was only slightly, and not significantly, superior to placebo on CGI autism score partially due to a phase order effect. However, fluoxetine was marginally superior to placebo on a composite measure of global effectiveness. Liquid fluoxetine did not significantly differ from placebo on treatment emergent side effects. Liquid fluoxetine in low doses is more effective than placebo in the treatment of repetitive behaviors in childhood autism. Limitations include small sample size and the crossover design of the study. Further replication and long-term maintenance trials are needed.","78":"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are often comorbid and have both performance and brain dysfunctions during motor response inhibition. Serotonin agonists modulate motor response inhibition and have shown positive behavioural effects in both disorders. We therefore used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the so far unknown shared and disorder-specific inhibitory brain dysfunctions in these two disorders, as well as the effects of a single dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. Age-matched boys with ADHD (18), ASD (19) and healthy controls (25) were compared with fMRI during a stop task measuring motor inhibition. Patients were scanned twice, under either an acute dose of fluoxetine or placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised design. Repeated measures analyses within patients assessed drug effects. To test for potential normalisation effects of brain dysfunctions, patients under each drug condition were compared to controls. Under placebo, relative to controls, ASD boys showed overactivation in left and right inferior frontal cortex (IFC), while ADHD boys showed disorder-specific underactivation in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and basal ganglia. Under fluoxetine, the prefrontal dysfunctions were no longer observed, due to inverse effects of fluoxetine on these activations: fluoxetine downregulated IFC and OFC activation in ASD but upregulated them in ADHD. The findings show that fluoxetine normalises frontal lobe dysfunctions in both disorders via inverse effects, downregulating abnormally increased frontal activation in ASD and upregulating abnormally decreased frontal activation in ADHD, potentially reflecting inverse baseline serotonin levels in both disorders.","79":"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) share brain function abnormalities during cognitive flexibility. Serotonin is involved in both disorders, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can modulate cognitive flexibility and improve behavior in both disorders. Thus, this study investigates shared and disorder-specific brain dysfunctions in these 2 disorders during reward reversal, and the acute effects of an SSRI on these. Age-matched boys with ADHD (15), ASD (18), and controls (21) were compared with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a reversal task. Patients were scanned twice, under either an acute dose of Fluoxetine or placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized design. Repeated-measures analyses within patients assessed drug effects. Patients under each drug condition were compared with controls to assess normalization effects. fMRI data showed that, under placebo, ASD boys underactivated medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), compared with control and ADHD boys. Both patient groups shared decreased precuneus activation. Under Fluoxetine, mPFC activation was up-regulated and normalized in ASD boys relative to controls, but down-regulated in ADHD boys relative to placebo, which was concomitant with worse task performance in ADHD. Fluoxetine therefore has inverse effects on mPFC activation in ASD and ADHD during reversal learning, suggesting dissociated underlying serotonin abnormalities.","80":"Selective serotonin receptor inhibitors are prescribed to reduce the severity of core behaviors of autism spectrum disorders, but their efficacy remains uncertain. To determine the efficacy of fluoxetine for reducing the frequency and severity of obsessive-compulsive behaviors in autism spectrum disorders. Multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Participants aged 7.5-18 years with autism spectrum disorders and a total score of 6 or higher on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, modified for pervasive developmental disorder (CYBOCS-PDD) were recruited from 3 tertiary health centers across Australia. Enrollment began November 2010 and ended April 2017. Follow-up ended August 2017. Participants were randomized to receive fluoxetine (n\u2009=\u200975) or placebo (n\u2009=\u200971). Study medication was commenced at 4 or 8 mg\/d for the first week, depending on weight, and then titrated to a maximum dose of 20 or 30 mg\/d over 4 weeks. Treatment duration was 16 weeks. The primary outcome was the total score on the CYBOCS-PDD (scores range from 0-20; higher scores indicate higher levels of maladaptive behaviors; minimal clinically important difference, 2 points) at 16 weeks postrandomization, analyzed with a linear regression model adjusted for stratification factors (site, age at baseline, and intellectual disability), with an additional prespecified model that included additional adjustment for baseline score, sex, communication level, and imbalanced baseline and demographic variables. Among the 146 participants who were randomized (85% males; mean age, 11.2 years), 109 completed the trial; 31 in the fluoxetine group and 21 in the placebo group dropped out or did not complete treatment. The mean CYBOCS-PDD score from baseline to 16 weeks decreased in the fluoxetine group from 12.80 to 9.02 points (3.72-point decrease; 95% CI, -4.85 to -2.60) and in the placebo group from 13.13 to 10.89 points (2.53-point decrease; 95% CI, -3.86 to -1.19). The between-group mean difference at 16 weeks was -2.01 (95% CI, -3.77 to -0.25; P\u2009=\u2009.03) (adjusted for stratification factors), and in the prespecified model with further adjustment, it was -1.17 (95% CI, -3.01 to 0.67; P\u2009=\u2009.21). In this preliminary study of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders, treatment with fluoxetine compared with placebo resulted in significantly lower scores for obsessive-compulsive behaviors at 16 weeks. Interpretation is limited by the high dropout rate, null findings of prespecified analyses that accounted for potentially confounding factors and baseline imbalances, and CIs for the treatment effect that included the minimal clinically important difference. anzctr.org.au Identifier: ACTRN12608000173392.","81":"We studied the correlation between response to fluvoxamine and serotonin transporter gene promoter region polymorphism (5-HTTLPR). Eighteen children with autistic disorder completed a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover study of fluvoxamine. Behavioral assessments were obtained before and at 12 weeks of treatment. 5-HTTLPR (long (l) or short(s)), was analyzed by the PCR method. Ten out of 18 patients responded to fluvoxamine treatment; allele type analysis revealed that clinical global effectiveness was noted significantly more in the l allele than in the s allele. However, with respect to language use, a significant effectiveness was noted in the s allele. 5-HTTLPR may influence the individual responses to fluvoxamine administration.","82":"Fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor which modulates serotoninergic activities, is a useful drug for patients with an autistic disorder. Genetic variation of the serotonin receptor may influence the efficacy of fluvoxamine treatment. We studied the correlation between clinical responses to fluvoxamine and serotonin receptor gene polymorphism (5-HT2AR) in children with an autistic disorder. Eighteen patients completed a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover study. Clinical global impression (CGI) by child neurologists and interviews for parents were assessed after 12 weeks of fluvoxamine treatment. Behavioral assessments consisting of 20 items by newly created Behavioral Assessment Scale (BAS) were obtained before as well as 6 and 12 weeks after treatment. For genotyping of 5-HT2AR, 102 T\/C polymorphism was analyzed by the PCR method. Seven cases of T\/T, 6 of T\/C and 5 of C\/C were identified. The patients with the genotype T\/C responded more favorably when estimated by CGI and parents' report at 12 weeks of treatment. Although not significant statistically (p = 0.0578), the number of improved BAS items in these patients were larger after fluvoxamine than placebo treatment. On analyses of individual BAS items, the patients with the genotype C\/C showed improvement of unnatural facial expression, which was significant at 6 weeks, but not at 12 weeks, of fluvoxamine treatment. In the patients with the genotype T\/C, eye movements and emotional changes were significantly improved at 12 weeks of treatment. Our results suggested that genetic polymorphism of 102 T\/C in the 5-HT2AR gene may have influence on the response to fluvoxamine treatment for patients with an autistic disorder. Because of the small numbers of subject studied here, further studies are needed. The methods of fluvoxamine treatment, such as appropriate dosage and treatment duration, should also be clarified.","83":"To observe the clinical efficacy of dopamine modulator methylphenidate (MPH) of extended-release formulations (MPH-ER) augmentation of ongoing fluvoxamine treatment in refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and its effects on patient's anxiety and sleep quality.\u2029 Methods: A pilot randomized, placebo-controlled, and double-blind trial was conducted at an outpatient, single-center academic setting. Participants included 44 adults with serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment-refractory OCD and they received a stable fluvoxamine pharmacotherapy with Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores higher than 20. The 44 patients were randomly assigned into a study group and a control group, with 22 patiencs in each group. Fluvoxamine and MPH-ER were given to the study group, while fluvoxamine and placebo were given to the control group, with 8 weeks of the treatment course. Y-BOCS, Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) were used to assess the efficacy, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to evaluate the sleep quality, and Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS) was used to evaluate the side effects. Data were analyzed in the intention-to-treat sample.\u2029 Results: The improvement in the Y-BOCS total score, Y-BOCS obsession subscale score and HAMA score were more prominent in the study group than those in the control group (P<0.001). There was no significant difference in PSQI score and TESS score between the two groups. MPH-ER was well tolerated.\u2029 Conclusion: Fluvoxamine combined with MPH-ER is effective in the treatment of refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder. It can improve anxiety and has no adverse effect on sleep quality.","84":"We sought to determine whether high-dose folinic acid improves verbal communication in children with non-syndromic autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and language impairment in a double-blind placebo control setting. Forty-eight children (mean age 7 years 4 \u2009months; 82% male) with ASD and language impairment were randomized to receive 12 weeks of high-dose folinic acid (2\u2009mg\u2009kg<sup>-1<\/sup> per day, maximum 50\u2009mg per day; n=23) or placebo (n=25). Children were subtyped by glutathione and folate receptor-\u03b1 autoantibody (FRAA) status. Improvement in verbal communication, as measured by a ability-appropriate standardized instrument, was significantly greater in participants receiving folinic acid as compared with those receiving placebo, resulting in an effect of 5.7 (1.0,10.4) standardized points with a medium-to-large effect size (Cohen's d=0.70). FRAA status was predictive of response to treatment. For FRAA-positive participants, improvement in verbal communication was significantly greater in those receiving folinic acid as compared with those receiving placebo, resulting in an effect of 7.3 (1.4,13.2) standardized points with a large effect size (Cohen's d=0.91), indicating that folinic acid treatment may be more efficacious in children with ASD who are FRAA positive. Improvements in subscales of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, the Aberrant Behavior Checklist, the Autism Symptom Questionnaire and the Behavioral Assessment System for Children were significantly greater in the folinic acid group as compared with the placebo group. There was no significant difference in adverse effects between treatment groups. Thus, in this small trial of children with non-syndromic ASD and language impairment, treatment with high-dose folinic acid for 12 weeks resulted in improvement in verbal communication as compared with placebo, particularly in those participants who were positive for FRAAs.","85":"This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of folinic acid\/placebo as an adjuvant to risperidone on inappropriate speech and other behavioral symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Galantamine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and an allosteric potentiator of nicotinic receptors. This study aimed to evaluate the possible effects of galantamine as an augmentative therapy to risperidone, in autistic children. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, 40 outpatients aged 4-12 years whom had a diagnosis of autism (DSM IV-TR) and a score of 12 or higher on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) Irritability subscale were equally randomized to receive either galantamine (up to 24 mg\/day) or placebo, in addition to risperidone (up to 2 mg\/day), for 10 weeks.

Based on these studies, we decided to assess the effectiveness of Ginkgo biloba extract (Ginko T.D., Tolidaru, Iran) as an adjunctive agent to risperidone in the treatment of autism. Forty-seven outpatients with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of autism ages between 4 and 12 years were assigned to this double blinded clinical trial and were randomly divided into two groups. One group received risperidone plus Ginko T.D and the other received risperidone plus placebo. The dose of risperidone was 1-3 mg\/day and the dose of Ginko T.D. was 80 mg\/day for patients under 30 kg and 120 mg\/day for patients above 30 kg. Patients were assessed using Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) rating scale and the side effect check list every 2 weeks until the endpoint. None of the 5 subscales of ABC-C rating scale showed significant differences between the two groups. Incidents of side effects were not significantly different between the two groups. Adding Ginkgo biloba to risperidone did not affect the treatment outcome of ADs. Nevertheless, further observations are needed to confirm this result.","89":"This study compared live ratings with ratings of videotapes and compared response to clomipramine with response to haloperidol in 8 subjects, mean age 5.62 years, who met criteria for autism. They were consecutive admissions to a pilot study of clomipramine (n = 4) or a double-blind, placebo controlled study of haloperidol (n = 4). Live ratings were performed by two raters at the end of the pre-treatment placebo baseline period and at the end of the drug treatment period on the CPRS and the CGI and were videotaped. Employing the same instruments, these videotapes were rated by two raters who did not know the subjects and were blind to study design, treatment, and study phase. Ratings of videotapes significantly differed from live ratings. A treatment effect for haloperidol was detected only on live ratings and not on ratings of videotapes. No treatment effect was detected for clomipramine in either live or videotape ratings.","90":"This article presents data on the diagnosis and phenomenology of schizophrenia in 16 hospitalized children, ages 5.5 to 11.75 years. These 16 subjects are the first to complete an ongoing double-blind, placebo-controlled study of haloperidol in children with schizophrenia diagnosed by DSM-III-R criteria. We describe the pharmacologic treatment response of this subsample and compare our diagnostic, phenomenologic, and treatment findings with those of other investigators. Our results show that children under age 12 can be diagnosed with schizophrenia by the same criteria used for adults, that they show comparable clinical symptoms, and that on haloperidol they show improvement in target psychotic symptoms, at least in a short-term inpatient setting.","91":"Plasma beta-endorphin levels were measured in 13 autistic children, aged 3.67 to 11.67 years at the end of treatment (naltrexone, haloperidol, pimozide, or placebo) and in 5 of the 13 children also at baseline. Baseline plasma beta-endorphin levels were lower than those reported in the literature. There was a strong correlation between plasma beta-endorphin levels and severity of sterotypies in all children. Naltrexone did not seem to have a specific effect on plasma beta-endorphin levels; short-term haloperidol treatment was associated with an increase, whereas long-term haloperidol treatment seemed to have a depressive effect on plasma beta-endorphin levels, which rose after withdrawal of haloperidol.","92":"This report presents preliminary findings in an ongoing double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the safety and efficacy of haloperidol in hospitalized schizophrenic children. The subjects are diagnosed schizophrenic by DSM-III-R criteria and admitted to the Bellevue Hospital Children's Inpatient Psychiatric Unit. The study is 10 weeks in duration and employs a crossover design. After a 2-week placebo baseline period, the subjects enter double-blind treatment for 8 weeks, by random assignment receiving either haloperidol for 4 weeks followed by placebo for 4 weeks, or alternatively, placebo for 4 weeks followed by haloperidol for 4 weeks. Dosage, regulated individually, ranges from 0.5 to 10.0 mg\/day. To date, of an anticipated 20 subjects, 12 have completed the study. These children, 9 boys and 3 girls, were ages 5.5 to 11.75 years upon study entry. Haloperidol was superior to placebo for reduction of target symptoms with optimal haloperidol dose of 0.5 to 3.5 mg\/day (0.02-0.12 mg\/kg\/day).","93":"This double-blind and placebo-controlled clinical trial in autistic children had three objectives: (a) to replicate earlier findings that haloperidol administration is associated with a significant reduction of behavioral symptoms; (b) to further assess its safety when given on a short-term basis; and (c) to assess whether it has an effect on discrimination learning. Forty-five children, 2.02 to 7.58 years old (M = 4.49), completed this crossover design, with random assignment to treatment sequences. Haloperidol was shown to be a powerful therapeutic agent when administered for 4 weeks and free of side effects; at doses ranging from 0.25 to 4.0 mg\/day (M = 0.844), there was a clinically and statistically significant reduction of a variety of symptoms. Under the given conditions, the children failed to learn on either haloperidol or placebo.","94":null,"95":"In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study the administration of haloperidol resulted in significant decreases in behavioral symptoms and in general clinical improvement in 40 autistic children ages 2.33 to 6.92 years. Haloperidol also produced greater facilitation and retention of discrimination learning in the laboratory. No adverse effects were observed at therapeutic doses, which ranged from 0.5 to 3.0 mg\/day or 0.019 to 0.217 mg\/kg per day.","96":"The reliability of saliva lithium levels in monitoring serum lithium levels in children taking lithium has rarely been studied, despite the potential usefulness of such a study and despite a number of adult studies focusing on the technique. In a study of 61 aggressive school-age children diagnosed as undersocialized, aggressive conduct disorder, a subsample of 21 children received lithium. Saliva lithium levels aided in monitoring side effects, and in 15 of the 21 children simultaneous saliva and serum lithium levels were done. These were highly correlated (r = 0.83) and the saliva to serum ratio was 2.53 across subjects. The results indicate that future work with larger numbers of children should study the ratio of saliva to serum lithium levels. Adult studies have shown that there is too great a variability in saliva to serum lithium level ratios to support the use of a fixed saliva to serum lithium ratio. This may not be the case in children. Seventeen children from the lithium subsample experienced 41 lithium-related side effects. Most children suffered side effects on relatively high doses of lithium, and those few who experienced side effects on low dosage had saliva lithium levels that were proportionately high. However, it remains unclear whether saliva lithium can be used to monitor side effects.","97":"The effects of lithium carbonate and haloperidol on cognition were examined in a placebo-controlled, double-blind study of 61 treatment-resistant, hospitalized school-aged children. They all had a DSM-III diagnosis of conduct disorder-- undersocialized , aggressive, with a profile of highly explosive and aggressive behavior. Children were assessed at the end of a two-week placebo-baseline period and again after four weeks of treatment. Drug effects on cognition were mild. Haloperidol (mean dose, 2.95 mg\/day) caused significant decreases in Porteus Maze test quotient scores and a slowing of reaction time (RT) on a simple RT task. Lithium carbonate (mean dose, 1,166 mg\/day) adversely affected qualitative scores on the Porteus Maze test. No significant treatment effects were found for the Matching Familiar Figures Test, short-term recognition memory and concept attainment tasks, or the Stroop Test.","98":"The efficacy and safety of haloperidol, lithium carbonate, and placebo were critically assessed in 61 treatment-resistant, hospitalized children aged 5.2 to 12.9 years with diagnoses of conduct disorder, aggressive type. In this double-blind and well-controlled study, the optimal dosages of haloperidol ranged from 1.0 to 6.0 mg\/day and those of lithium carbonate from 500 to 2,000 mg\/day. For the assessment of behavioral changes and untoward effects, various rating scales were used in different settings. Both haloperidol and lithium carbonate were found to be significantly superior to placebo in decreasing behavioral symptoms. Although both medications were clinically effective, haloperidol was associated more often with untoward effects than was lithium carbonate.","99":"Agitated delirium is common and highly distressing. Medications are often needed to reduce agitation, but it is unclear what the desired level of sedation is. This study assessed personalized sedation goals (PSGs) and their predictors for patients in a delirium clinical trial and in clinical vignettes. This was a preplanned secondary analysis of a double-blind randomized clinical trial examining the sedative effect of chlorpromazine and\/or haloperidol in patients with agitated delirium. At the baseline, caregivers and nurses were independently asked to select the PSG for the trial patient from 5 choices corresponding to Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) scores of 0 or higher (no sedation), -1 to -2, -3, -4, and -5 (deep sedation). Respondents also selected a PSG for 6 vignettes that differed by the level of agitation, ability to communicate, and survival. Forty-two caregivers and 39 nurses answered questions regarding PSGs. For the trial patient, caregivers preferred RASS scores of -1 to -2 most often (36%), whereas nurses preferred an RASS score of -3 most often (51 %). Caregivers were significantly more likely than nurses to choose lighter sedation (odds ratio [OR], 4.8; P = .01) despite reporting greater delirium-related distress (P = .0006). Patients were undersedated 33% to 53% of the time and oversedated 0% to 15% of the time according to the PSG response criteria. In the case vignettes, deeper sedation was preferred by nurses (P < .0001) and for patients who were unable to communicate (OR, 3.1-4.4; P < .0001) and had a shorter life expectancy (OR, 1.7; P = .002). Caregivers often preferred lighter sedation than nurses. Many patients were undersedated in comparison with caregivers' PSGs, and this highlights room for improvement. In the last days of life, many patients with cancer develop delirium and become restless\/agitated; this can be highly distressing. Caregivers and physicians alike are often concerned about the use of sedatives for agitated delirium and try to find a balance between maximizing comfort and maintaining communication. This study examined the concept of a personalized sedation goal for setting an individualized target for the level of sedation. Caregivers often preferred lighter sedation than nurses. Many patients were undersedated in comparison with caregivers' stated goals, and this highlights room for improvement.","100":"Few studies have examined how the use of rescue medications could be used to inform on the efficacy of interventions in delirium clinical trials. The objective of this study was to determine the association among rescue medication use, Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS), and perceived comfort by the nurses and caregivers. This was a pre-planned secondary analysis of a double-blind, randomized clinical trial comparing the use of a single dose of lorazepam plus haloperidol versus placebo plus haloperidol in patients with agitated delirium. Rescue medications were considered the gold standard for this analysis. The optimal cutoff for RASS analysis was calculated by using general linear regression models and determining the area of the curve and using the top left approach. We used 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 tables to examine the association between rescue medication use and perceived comfort. Fifty-eight patients received the study medications and 52 (89%) completed the 8-h observation period. There were 26 (50%) patients in each arm. The lorazepam\/haloperidol arm required fewer rescue doses (4\/26 (15%)) vs. 16\/26 (62%), p\u2009=\u20090.004). Patients with a greater initial RASS reduction required fewer rescue doses. The cutoff value for RASS improvement was 4 points, area under the curve (AUC) 0.64 (95% CI 0.49-0.79) for those who required no rescue doses, and 3 points, AUC 0.74 (95% CI 0.52-0.96) for those who required more than one rescue dose. Rescue medication use was responsive to change and associated with both RASS scores and perceived patient comfort by the nurse and caregiver.","101":"The role of neuroleptics for terminal agitated delirium is controversial. We assessed the effect of three neuroleptic strategies on refractory agitation in patients with cancer with terminal delirium. In this single-centre, double-blind, parallel-group, randomised trial, patients with advanced cancer, aged at least 18 years, admitted to the palliative and supportive care unit at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA), with refractory agitation, despite low-dose haloperidol, were randomly assigned to receive intravenous haloperidol dose escalation at 2 mg every 4 h, neuroleptic rotation with chlorpromazine at 25 mg every 4 h, or combined haloperidol at 1\u2008mg and chlorpromazine at 12\u00b75 mg every 4 h, until death or discharge. Rescue doses identical to the scheduled doses were administered at inception, and then hourly as needed. Permuted block randomisation (block size six; 1:1:1) was done, stratified by baseline Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) scores. Research staff, clinicians, patients, and caregivers were masked to group assignment. The primary outcome was change in RASS score from time 0 to 24 h. Comparisons among group were done by modified intention-to-treat analysis. This completed study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03021486. Between July 5, 2017, and July 1, 2019, 998 patients were screened for eligibility, with 68 being enrolled and randomly assigned to treatment; 45 received the masked study interventions (escalation n=15, rotation n=16, combination n=14). RASS score decreased significantly within 30 min and remained low at 24 h in the escalation group (n=10, mean RASS score change between 0 h and 24 h -3\u00b76 [95% CI -5\u00b70 to -2\u00b72]), rotation group (n=11, -3\u00b73 [-4\u00b74 to -2\u00b72]), and combination group (n=10, -3\u00b70 [-4\u00b76 to -1\u00b74]), with no difference among groups (p=0\u00b771). The most common serious toxicity was hypotension (escalation n=6 [40%], rotation n=5 [31%], combination n=3 [21%]); there were no treatment-related deaths. Our data provide preliminary evidence that the three strategies of neuroleptics might reduce agitation in patients with terminal agitation. These findings are in the context of the single-centre design, small sample size, and lack of a placebo-only group.

The objective of the current study was to identify the MCID for RASS using 2 anchor-based approaches. The current study was a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial to compare the effect of lorazepam versus placebo as an adjuvant to haloperidol for persistent agitation in patients with delirium. The primary outcome was change in RASS (10-point numeric rating scale ranging from -5 [unarousable] to +4 [combative]) from baseline to 8 hours after treatment administration. The sensitivity-specificity and within-patient change methods were used to identify the MCID, with the anchor being patient comfort after the study intervention as perceived by caregivers and nurses. A total of 90 patients were randomized and 58 (64%) received the study medication for restlessness\/agitation (mean baseline RASS, 1.6). A total of 23 caregivers (61%) and 23 nurses (55%) perceived that the patient was more comfortable after treatment. Using the sensitivity-specificity method, the optimal RASS reduction was \u22654 points according to both caregivers (sensitivity of 61% and specificity of 80%; area under the curve, 0.71) and nurses (sensitivity of 73% and specificity of 84%; area under the curve, 0.78). The RASS cutoff value based on the within-patient change method was similar (-4.2 for caregivers and -4.0 for nurses). For patients with persistent restlessness\/agitation, a reduction of \u22654 points in RASS was considered to be the MCID for both nurses and caregivers. These preliminary findings may have implications for sample size calculation and the interpretation of treatment effect in future delirium trials.

To compare the effect of lorazepam vs placebo as an adjuvant to haloperidol for persistent agitation in patients with delirium in the setting of advanced cancer. Single-center, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial conducted at an acute palliative care unit at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, enrolling 93 patients with advanced cancer and agitated delirium despite scheduled haloperidol from February 11, 2014, to June 30, 2016, with data collection completed in October 2016. Lorazepam (3 mg) intravenously (n\u2009=\u200947) or placebo (n\u2009=\u200943) in addition to haloperidol (2 mg) intravenously upon the onset of an agitation episode. The primary outcome was change in Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) score (range, -5 [unarousable] to 4 [very agitated or combative]) from baseline to 8 hours after treatment administration. Secondary end points were rescue neuroleptic use, delirium recall, comfort (perceived by caregivers and nurses), communication capacity, delirium severity, adverse effects, discharge outcomes, and overall survival. Among 90 randomized patients (mean age, 62 years; women, 42 [47%]), 58 (64%) received the study medication and 52 (90%) completed the trial. Lorazepam\u2009+\u2009haloperidol resulted in a significantly greater reduction of RASS score at 8 hours (-4.1 points) than placebo\u2009+\u2009haloperidol (-2.3 points) (mean difference, -1.9 points [95% CI, -2.8 to -0.9]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). The lorazepam\u2009+\u2009haloperidol group required less median rescue neuroleptics (2.0 mg) than the placebo\u2009+\u2009haloperidol group (4.0 mg) (median difference, -1.0 mg [95% CI, -2.0 to 0]; P\u2009=\u2009.009) and was perceived to be more comfortable by both blinded caregivers and nurses (caregivers: 84% for the lorazepam\u2009+\u2009haloperidol group vs 37% for the placebo\u2009+\u2009haloperidol group; mean difference, 47% [95% CI, 14% to 73%], P\u2009=\u2009.007; nurses: 77% for the lorazepam\u2009+\u2009haloperidol group vs 30% for the placebo\u2009+\u2009haloperidol group; mean difference, 47% [95% CI, 17% to 71%], P\u2009=\u2009.005). No significant between-group differences were found in delirium-related distress and survival. The most common adverse effect was hypokinesia (3 patients in the lorazepam\u2009+\u2009haloperidol group [19%] and 4 patients in the placebo\u2009+\u2009haloperidol group [27%]). In this preliminary trial of hospitalized patients with agitated delirium in the setting of advanced cancer, the addition of lorazepam to haloperidol compared with haloperidol alone resulted in a significantly greater reduction in agitation at 8 hours. Further research is needed to assess generalizability and adverse effects. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01949662.","104":"Gastroparesis is a debilitating condition that causes nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Management includes analgesics and antiemetics, but symptoms are often refractory. Haloperidol has been utilized in the palliative care setting for similar symptoms. The study objective was to determine whether haloperidol as an adjunct to conventional therapy would improve symptoms in gastroparesis patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adult ED patients with acute exacerbation of previously diagnosed gastroparesis. The treatment group received 5 mg of haloperidol plus conventional therapy (determined by the treating physician). The control group received a placebo plus conventional therapy. The severity of each subject's abdominal pain and nausea were assessed before intervention and every 15 minutes thereafter for 1 hour using a 10-point scale for pain and a 5-point scale for nausea. Primary outcomes were decreased pain and nausea 1 hour after treatment. Of the 33 study patients, 15 were randomized to receive haloperidol. Before treatment, the mean intensity of pain was 8.5 in the haloperidol group and 8.28 in the placebo group; mean pretreatment nausea scores were 4.53 and 4.11, respectively. One hour after therapy, the mean pain and nausea scores in the haloperidol group were 3.13 and 1.83 compared to 7.17 and 3.39 in the placebo group. The reduction in mean pain intensity therapy was 5.37 in the haloperidol group (p \u2264 0.001) compared to 1.11 in the placebo group (p = 0.11). The reduction in mean nausea score was 2.70 in the haloperidol group (p \u2264 0.001) and 0.72 in the placebo group (p = 0.05). Therefore, the reductions in symptom scores were statistically significant in the haloperidol group but not in the placebo group. No adverse events were reported. Haloperidol as an adjunctive therapy is superior to placebo for acute gastroparesis symptoms.","105":"To demonstrate the feasibility of a placebo-controlled trial of antipsychotics for delirium in the intensive care unit and to test the hypothesis that antipsychotics would improve days alive without delirium or coma. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Six tertiary care medical centers in the US. One hundred one mechanically ventilated medical and surgical intensive care unit patients. Patients were randomly assigned to receive haloperidol or ziprasidone or placebo every 6 hrs for up to 14 days. Twice each day, frequency of study drug administration was adjusted according to delirium status, level of sedation, and side effects. The primary end point was the number of days patients were alive without delirium or coma. During the 21-day study period, patients in the haloperidol group spent a similar number days alive without delirium or coma (median [interquartile range], 14.0 [6.0-18.0] days) as did patients in the ziprasidone (15.0 [9.1-18.0] days) and placebo groups (12.5 [1.2-17.2] days; p = 0.66). No differences were found in secondary clinical outcomes, including ventilator-free days (p = .25), hospital length of stay (p = .68), and mortality (p = .81). Ten (29%) patients in the haloperidol group reported symptoms consistent with akathisia, compared with six (20%) patients in the ziprasidone group and seven (19%) patients in the placebo group (p = .60), and a global measure of extrapyramidal symptoms was similar between treatment groups (p = .46). A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of antipsychotics for delirium in mechanically ventilated intensive care unit patients is feasible. Treatment with antipsychotics in this limited pilot trial did not improve the number of days alive without delirium or coma, nor did it increase adverse outcomes. Thus, a large trial is needed to determine whether use of antipsychotics for intensive care unit delirium is appropriate.","106":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by core social deficits. Prognosis is poor, in part, because existing medications target only associated ASD features. Emerging evidence suggests that the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) may be a blood-based biomarker of social functioning and a possible treatment for ASD. However, prior OXT treatment trials have produced equivocal results, perhaps because of variability in patients' underlying neuropeptide biology, but this hypothesis has not been tested. Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design, we tested the efficacy and tolerability of 4-wk intranasal OXT treatment (24 International Units, twice daily) in 32 children with ASD, aged 6-12 y. When pretreatment neuropeptide measures were included in the statistical model, OXT compared with placebo treatment significantly enhanced social abilities in children with ASD [as measured by the trial's primary outcome measure, the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS)]. Importantly, pretreatment blood OXT concentrations also predicted treatment response, such that individuals with the lowest pretreatment OXT concentrations showed the greatest social improvement. OXT was well tolerated, and its effects were specific to social functioning, with no observed decrease in repetitive behaviors or anxiety. Finally, as with many trials, some placebo-treated participants showed improvement on the SRS. This enhanced social functioning was mirrored by a posttreatment increase in their blood OXT concentrations, suggesting that increased endogenous OXT secretion may underlie this improvement. These findings indicate that OXT treatment enhances social abilities in children with ASD and that individuals with pretreatment OXT signaling deficits may stand to benefit the most from OXT treatment.","107":"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a rare inherited genetic disorder causing severe intellectual disability and autistic-like symptoms. Individuals with FXS, males in particular, often exhibit extreme eye gaze avoidance and hyperarousal when they encounter stressful social situations. We investigated whether oxytocin (OT), a hormone with prosocial and anxiolytic effects, could alleviate symptoms of social anxiety in this population. A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled single-dose trial was performed with intranasal administration of placebo, 24 IU OT and 48 IU OT. Measures of eye gaze frequency, heart rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), heart rate variability (HRV) and salivary cortisol were obtained during a structured social challenge conducted 50 min following OT administration. Ten low-functioning males with FXS (aged 13-28 years) traveled to Stanford for the initial visit: 8 completed the study. Eye gaze frequency improved significantly in response to the 24 IU OT dose and salivary cortisol levels decreased significantly in response to the 48 IU OT dose. There was no effect of OT on heart rate, RSA or HRV although individual plots of the heart rate data suggested that OT increased heart rate in some participants and decreased heart rate in others. These findings suggest that intranasal administration of OT may ameliorate some symptoms of social anxiety in patients with FXS. Further double-blind placebo-controlled studies of OT, conducted in combination with behavioral treatment programs, may be warranted.","108":"Sleep disorders are frequently reported in autistic patients. Evidences suggest that increased oxidative stress and reduced antioxidants may play a major role in the pathogenesis of these disorders. Carnosine acts as an antioxidant, antitoxic and neuroprotective agent. The aim of this trial study was to examine the effects of carnosine supplementation on the sleep disorders and severity of autism core symptoms in autistic patients. In this double-blind, randomized clinical trial, 43 autistic patients (31 boys and 12 girls; aged 4 to 16 years) were divided into two groups of carnosine and control that received 500 mg of carnosine and 500 mg of placebo per day for 2 months, respectively. Sleep disorders were measured using Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaires. Gilliam Autism Rating Scale 2 was used to assess the effects of carnosine supplementation on the autism severity. Carnosine supplementation did not change anthropometric indices (p > 0.05) and showed no effect on autism severity (p > 0.05), whereas it significantly reduced sleep duration (p = 0.04), parasomnias (p = 0.02) and total sleep disorders score by 7.59% (p = 0.006) when compared with the control group. The results suggest that carnosine supplementation could be effective in improving sleep disturbances, in particular sleep duration and parasomnias subscales.","109":"L-carnitine was proposed as a potential treatment for patients diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder to improve mitochondrial dysfunction, but no prior randomized controlled trials have been conducted. Thirty subjects diagnosed with an ASD were randomly assigned to receive a standardized regimen (50 mg L-carnitine\/kg bodyweight\/day) of liquid L-carnitine (n=19) or placebo (n=11) for 3-months. Measures included changes in professionally completed Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), hand muscle testing, and modified clinical global impression (CGI) forms; parent completed Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC), treatment adherence measurement (TAM), frequency and intensity of side effect rating (FISER)\/global rating of side effect burden (GRSEB)\/patient report of incidence of side effects (PRISE) forms; and lab testing. Significant improvements were observed in CARS (-2.03, 95% CI=-3.7 to -0.31), CGI (-0.69, 95% CI=-1.1 to -0.06), and ATEC scores. Significant correlations between changes in serum free-carnitine levels and positive clinical changes were observed for hand muscle strength (R2=0.23, P=0.046), cognitive scores (R2=0.27, P=0.019), and CARS scores (R2=0.20, P=0.047). Study subjects were protocol-compliant (average adherence was >85%) and generally well-tolerated the L-carnitine therapy given. L-carnitine therapy (50 mg\/kilogram-bodyweight\/day) administered for 3-months significantly improved several clinical measurements of ASD severity, but subsequent studies are recommended.","110":"The purpose of this study was to conduct a 20-week controlled trial of lovastatin (10 to 40\u2009mg\/day) in youth with fragile X syndrome (FXS) ages 10 to 17\u2009years, combined with an open-label treatment of a parent-implemented language intervention (PILI), delivered via distance video teleconferencing to both treatment groups, lovastatin and placebo. A randomized, double-blind trial was conducted at one site in the Sacramento, California, metropolitan area. Fourteen participants were assigned to the lovastatin group; two participants terminated early from the study. Sixteen participants were assigned to the placebo group. Lovastatin or placebo was administered orally in a capsule form, starting at 10\u2009mg and increasing weekly or as tolerated by 10\u2009mg increments, up to a maximum dose of 40\u2009mg daily. A PILI was delivered to both groups for 12\u2009weeks, with 4 activities per week, through video teleconferencing by an American Speech-Language Association-certified Speech-Language Pathologist, in collaboration with a Board-Certified Behavior Analyst. Parents were taught to use a set of language facilitation strategies while interacting with their children during a shared storytelling activity. The main outcome measures included absolute change from baseline to final visit in the means for youth total number of story-related utterances, youth number of different word roots, and parent total number of story-related utterances. Significant increases in all primary outcome measures were observed in both treatment groups. Significant improvements were also observed in parent reports of the severity of spoken language and social impairments in both treatment groups. In all cases, the amount of change observed did not differ across the two treatment groups. Although gains in parental use of the PILI-targeted intervention strategies were observed in both treatment groups, parental use of the PILI strategies was correlated with youth gains in the placebo group and not in the lovastatin group. Participants in both groups demonstrated significant changes in the primary outcome measures. The magnitude of change observed across the two groups was comparable, providing additional support for the efficacy of the use of PILI in youth with FXS.

The moderating effects of these bridge symptoms on the response to flexibly dosed lurasidone 20-80 mg\/d compared to placebo treatment was analyzed in children and adolescents with bipolar I depression in a six-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind study followed by a 2-year, openlabel extension study of lurasidone. Sleep disturbances, assessed by \"difficulty with sleep\" (Children's Depression Rating Scale, Revised [CDRS-R] item 4) and \"decreased need for sleep\" (Young Mania Rating Scale [YMRS] item 4), and \"irritability\" (CDRS-R item-8, YMRS item 5) were identified as \"bridge\" symptoms and found to have replicable causal associations with depressive (CDRS-R total) and manic symptom clusters (YMRS total) at baseline and week-6. A greater improvement in overall depression severity at week 6 with lurasidone (vs. placebo) treatment was observed in the presence (vs. absence) of decreased need for sleep at study baseline, mediated in part by significant reductions from study baseline in decreased need for sleep and manic symptom severity. The absence of sleep disturbance and irritability in patients at open-label extension study baseline was associated with higher rates of sustained recovery (symptomatic and functional remission) over 6 months compared to patients with those symptoms at baseline (68% vs. 50%, Number Needed to Treat=6). Our findings suggest that sleep disturbance and irritability are cardinal symptoms that \"bridge\" between depressive and manic symptom clusters and influence treatment outcomes in youth with bipolar depression.","112":"To investigate the symptom network structure of major depressive disorder (MDD) with mixed features and implications for treatment. In this post-hoc analysis of a previously reported randomized trial, patients meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for MDD presenting with two or three manic symptoms (DSM-5 mixed features specifier) were randomized to 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with lurasidone 20-60\u00a0mg\/d (N\u00a0=\u00a0109) or placebo (N\u00a0=\u00a0100). The network structure of symptoms at baseline and their treatment moderating effects were investigated. Network analyses showed that both ``elevated mood'' (YMRS item 1) and ``increased motor activity-energy'' (YMRS item 2) were associated with ``sleep disturbance'' (\"bridge\" symptom) and the depressive symptom cluster. Presence of both \"elevated mood\" and \"increased motor activity-energy\" at baseline predicted significantly less improvement in MADRS and CGI-S score at week 6 with lurasidone (vs. placebo) compared to patients without these manic symptoms at baseline. The network model also showed \"rapid\/pressured speech\" (YMRS item 6) at baseline predicted improvement in both manic and depressive symptoms with lurasidone vs. placebo treatment. This was a post-hoc analysis where findings need to be confirmed by prospective controlled studies. This post-hoc analysis describes the symptom network structure of MDD with mixed features in a patient sample at study baseline. Specific manic symptoms were found to be linked to sleep disturbance (characterized as a \"bridge\" symptom), which in turn linked the manic and depressive symptom clusters. The presence (vs. absence) of the specific manic symptoms we identified moderated the antidepressant and antimanic effects of lurasidone in the treatment of MDD with mixed (subthreshold hypomanic) features.","113":"Patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia are at an increased risk for developing metabolic syndrome, which is associated with greater cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Treatment with some commonly used antipsychotic medications may increase the risk of developing metabolic syndrome. The aim of the study was to evaluate the safety of lurasidone in patients who continued lurasidone or switched from risperidone to lurasidone. A secondary aim was assessment of the effect of long-term lurasidone on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The treatment sample in the current study consisted of clinically stable patients with schizophrenia (N\u2009=\u2009223) who had completed a 12-month, double-blind study of lurasidone vs. risperidone. In the current extension study, all patients received 6\u2009months of open-label treatment with lurasidone, either continuing lurasidone assigned during the preceding double-blind trial, or switching from double-blind risperidone to lurasidone. Safety and tolerability parameters included body weight, prolactin, and metabolic laboratory tests. Six months of OL treatment with lurasidone was generally well-tolerated, with a low incidence of parkinsonism (4.5%) and akathisia (3.1%). Overall, few adverse events were rated as severe (4.9%), and discontinuation due to an adverse event was low in the lurasidone continuation vs. risperidone switch groups (3.7% vs. 6.9%). In the lurasidone continuation versus risperidone switch groups, change from OL baseline to 6-month endpoint (observed case) was observed in mean body weight (-\u20090.6 vs. -2.6\u2009kg), median total cholesterol (-\u20094.0 vs. +\u20094.5\u2009mg\/dL), triglycerides (-\u20094.5 vs. -5.5\u2009mg\/dL), glucose (0.0 vs. -3.0\u2009mg\/dL) and prolactin (males, +\u20090.15 vs. -11.2\u2009ng\/mL; females, +\u20091.3 vs. -30.8\u2009ng\/mL). Improvement in PANSS total score was maintained, from OL baseline to endpoint in the continuation vs. switch groups (+\u20091.0 vs. -1.0; OC). In this 6-month extension study, lurasidone treatment was generally well-tolerated and associated with minimal effects on weight, metabolic parameters, and prolactin levels. Patients who switched from risperidone to lurasidone experienced reductions in weight, metabolic parameters and prolactin levels commensurate with increases in these safety parameters experienced during the previous 12\u2009months of treatment with risperidone. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00641745 (Date of Registration: March 24, 2008).","114":"This study sought to investigate associations between levels of high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsCRP) prior to treatment and change in depressive symptoms and cognition in a short-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of lurasidone in children and adolescents with bipolar I depression. Patients 10-17\u00a0years of age with a DSM-5 diagnosis of bipolar I depression were randomized to 6\u00a0weeks of double-blind treatment with flexibly dosed lurasidone (20-80\u00a0mg\/day) (n\u00a0=\u00a0173) or placebo (n\u00a0=\u00a0170). The primary efficacy measure was change from baseline to week 6 in the Children's Depression Rating Scale, Revised (CDRS-R). Treatment response was defined as 50% or greater improvement on the CDRS-R from baseline to week 6. Cognitive function was evaluated with the computerized Brief Cogstate Battery at baseline and week 6. Analyses were adjusted for baseline BMI, as well as age. HsCRP was evaluated as a logarithmically transformed continuous variable and as a categorical variable dichotomized into lower (<1 mg\/L) and higher (\u22651 mg\/L) subgroups. A significant interaction was found between baseline hsCRP and treatment group for change in CDRS-R score at study endpoint, with larger placebo-corrected effect sizes for lurasidone in the higher baseline hsCRP group (\u22651 mg\/L). A significant BMI-by-hsCRP-by-treatment interaction was found for response rate with higher baseline hsCRP levels associated with greater antidepressant response to lurasidone (vs. placebo) in the normal BMI range subgroup (NNT\u00a0=\u00a02 in higher hsCRP vs. NNT\u00a0=\u00a05 in lower hsCRP groups) but not in the overweight\/obese patients (NNT\u00a0=\u00a06 in higher hsCRP vs. NNT\u00a0=\u00a05 in lower hsCRP). Similarly, a significant interaction effect was observed for the combination of hsCRP and BMI on the procognitive effect of lurasidone, with higher baseline hsCRP levels being associated with improvement in cognitive function for lurasidone (vs placebo) in the normal BMI range subgroup but not in overweight\/obese patients. These results suggest that young patients with bipolar depression with normal weight and higher levels of pre-treatment CRP may show a greater placebo-adjusted improvement in depressive symptoms and cognitive performance when treated with lurasidone. If these findings are confirmed in future prospective studies, CRP and BMI may prove to be useful diagnostic and predictive biomarkers in the treatment with lurasidone of children and adolescents with bipolar depression.","115":"The aim of this secondary analysis was to evaluate whether treatment with lurasidone was associated with impairment in sexual functioning in major depressive disorder (MDD) patients with subthreshold hypomanic symptoms (mixed features). Patients meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for MDD, who presented with 2 or 3 protocol-specified manic symptoms, were randomized to 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with flexible doses of either lurasidone 20-60 mg\/d (n = 109) or placebo (n = 100). The study was conducted between September 2011 and October 2014. Change in sexual functioning was assessed utilizing the 14-item self-report Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire (CSFQ-14) administered at baseline and week 6 endpoint. Change from baseline to week 6 in depression severity was assessed utilizing the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. Lurasidone significantly reduced mean MADRS total scores at week 6 endpoint (-20.5 vs -13.0; P < .001). Treatment with lurasidone was associated with significant endpoint improvement in CSFQ total scores versus placebo (+5.1 vs +3.1; P < .05). Fewer patients treated with lurasidone versus placebo shifted from normal to abnormal sexual function. The proportion of patients with a baseline-to-endpoint shift from normal to abnormal sexual function was smaller for lurasidone versus placebo (1.9% vs 4.3%; CSFQ criteria) at study endpoint. Use of higher lurasidone doses was not associated with greater impairment in sexual functioning. No treatment-emergent adverse events related to sexual function were reported during lurasidone treatment. In this secondary analysis of a placebo-controlled trial involving patients with MDD and mixed features, lurasidone was not associated with treatment-related sexual dysfunction. These findings were consistent across both structured assessments using a validated sexual functioning questionnaire (CSFQ) as well as adverse event reporting. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01421134.","116":"Site-independent ratings surveillance assessed ratings reliability in a clinical trial. Inter-rater reliability was assessed at the screen visit in a 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of lurasidone for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) with subthreshold hypomanic (\"mixed\") symptoms (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01421134). Site-based Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) interviews were paired with 184 site-independent ratings derived from audio-digital recordings. The paired MADRS and YMRS scores were highly correlated (r\u00a0=\u00a00.708 and 0.885, respectively) and generated minimal scoring discordance. The surveillance program identified 14 MADRS scores (7.6% of this sample) that were below the study entry criterion (MADRS \u226526) and resulted in screen failure. When present, paired scoring discordance was associated with symptom severity, interview length, interview quality, and the level of patient cooperation. Higher severity scores (MADRS \u226540 and YMRS \u226515) were associated with greater paired scoring discordance. Further, MADRS scores <30 and short MADRS interviews conducted in \u226412\u00a0min revealed significantly more pairs of discordant outliers (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04 and 0.009, respectively). The findings suggest that MDD patients with mixed features can be reliably assessed, that paired site-based and site-independent assessments were generally concordant, and that ratings surveillance may reinforce ratings precision.","117":"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of lurasidone in children and adolescents with bipolar depression. Patients 10 to 17 years old with a DSM-5 diagnosis of bipolar I depression were randomized to 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with flexible doses of lurasidone 20 to 80 mg\/day. The primary endpoint was change from\u00a0baseline to week 6 in the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) total score,\u00a0evaluated by a\u00a0mixed-model repeated-measures analysis. A total of 347 patients were randomized and received at least 1 dose of lurasidone (n\u00a0= 175; mean age 14.2 years; mean dose 33.6 mg\/day) or placebo (n\u00a0= 172; mean age 14.3 years). At week 6, treatment with lurasidone was associated with statistically significant improvement compared with placebo in CDRS-R total score (-21.0 versus\u00a0-15.3; p\u00a0< .0001; effect size 0.45). Lurasidone also was associated with statistically significant improvement in the Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar Severity depression score (key secondary measure) and in measures of anxiety, quality of life, and global functioning. Study completion rates were 92.0% in the lurasidone group and 89.7% in the placebo group; discontinuation rates due to adverse events were the same for the 2 groups (1.7%). The 2 most common adverse events on lurasidone were nausea and somnolence. Treatment with lurasidone was associated with few effects on weight and metabolic parameters. In this placebo-controlled study, monotherapy with lurasidone, in the dose range of 20 to 80 mg\/day, significantly decreased depressive symptoms in children and adolescents with bipolar depression. Lurasidone was well tolerated, with minimal effects on weight and metabolic parameters.

Patient-level data were pooled from five 6-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of fixed-dose, once-daily, oral lurasidone (40, 80, 120, or 160 mg\/d). Agitation was assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Excited Component (PANSS-EC) score, utilizing a mixed model for repeated measurement analysis. In patients with higher levels of agitation at baseline (PANSS-EC score\u226514; n=773), lurasidone was associated with significantly greater improvement in least-squares (LS) mean PANSS-EC scores versus placebo at Day 3\/4 (-1.6 vs -1.0; p<0.05), Day 7 (-2.3 vs -1.6; p<0.05), and at Week 6 endpoint (-5.5 vs -3.8; p<0.001; effect size=0.43). In patients with lower agitation at baseline (PANSS-EC score<14; n=754), LS mean PANSS-EC score change was significantly greater for lurasidone compared with placebo at Day 7 (-0.8 vs -0.1; p<0. 01) through Week 6 endpoint (-1.9 vs -0.9; p<0.001; effect size=0.31). Higher doses of lurasidone were notably more effective than lower doses in patients with more severe agitation at study baseline. In this pooled analysis of 5 short-term studies, lurasidone provided early and sustained reduction in agitation, assessed using the PANSS-EC score, in patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. Higher doses of lurasidone were particularly effective in patients with more severe agitation at study baseline. Overall, these results suggest that lurasidone may be a useful treatment option for patients exhibiting agitation associated with acute psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia.

To evaluate the recurrence prevention efficacy of lurasidone for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder, patients received up to 20 weeks of open-label lurasidone (20-80mg\/d) combined with lithium or valproate during an initial stabilization phase. A total of 496 patients met stabilization criteria and were randomized to 28 weeks of double-blind treatment with lurasidone (20-80mg\/d) or placebo, in combination with lithium or valproate. Based on a Cox proportional hazard model, treatment with lurasidone reduced the probability of recurrence of any mood episode by 29% (primary endpoint), however, the reduction did not achieve statistical significance. Probability of recurrence on lurasidone was significantly lower in patients with an index episode of depression (HR, 0.57; P=0.039), in patients with any index episode who were not rapid-cycling (HR, 0.69; P=0.046), and when recurrence was based on MADRS, YMRS, or CGI-BP-S severity criteria (HR, 0.53; P=0.025; sensitivity analysis). Long-term treatment with lurasidone combined with lithium or valproate was found to be safe and well-tolerated, with minimal effects on weight or metabolic parameters.","120":"Several studies have found that depressed, post-menopausal females may respond differently to antidepressants compared to pre-menopausal females. The atypical antipsychotic lurasidone, whose mechanism of action differs from SSRIs and other standard antidepressants, was shown in a 6-week randomized, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled study (n=209), to be effective in treating major depressive disorder (MDD) with mixed features (subthreshold hypomanic symptoms). This post-hoc analysis assessed the efficacy of lurasidone in this study by menopausal status. The main outcome measure for this post-hoc analysis was change in MADRS score from baseline to week 6 endpoint for two lurasidone-treated subgroups: presumptive pre-menopausal (<52years) and presumptive post-menopausal (\u226552years) patients, compared to placebo treatment, using a mixed-model for repeated-measures analysis, and calculation of the effect size for each subgroup. Additional efficacy assessments included the CGI-S, HAM-A and YMRS. An exploratory analysis was also conducted removing presumptive peri-menopausal women (ages 45-51years) to allow for clearer definition of pre- and post-menopausal status. A total of 56 lurasidone-treated and 47 placebo-treated pre-menopausal females, and 17 lurasidone-treated and 25 placebo-treated post-menopausal females were available from the larger study for comparison on key outcome measures. The pre- and post-menopausal subgroups had similar demographic and clinical characteristics at study baseline (other than age), including number of past major depressive episodes as well as depressive and manic symptom severity. Mean daily lurasidone dose was similar for each subgroup during the study. Both the primary and exploratory analyses showed that both lurasidone-treated post-menopausal and pre-menopausal females responded significantly compared to placebo (p=0.016 or less) on the MADRS, and that post-menopausal patients had a numerically larger response (effect size=0.96) than pre-menopausal patients (effect size=0.64). All other secondary outcome measures for lurasidone compared with placebo treatment were significant (p=0.045 or less) for both subgroups. In this post-hoc analysis, lurasidone was found to be effective in treating post-menopausal MDD patients with mixed features (subthreshold hypomanic symptoms).","121":"To explore possible benefits of a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agent for autistic symptoms based on postmortem observation of nAChR abnormalities (deficient \u03b14\u03b22 nAChRs, excess \u03b17 nAChRs) in brains of patients with autism. Mecamylamine, because of its safety record in children with other disorders, was chosen for this first exploration. Twenty children with autism spectrum disorder age 4-12 years were randomly assigned for 14 weeks to placebo (n=8) or mecamylamine (n=12) in ascending fixed doses: 0.5 mg\/day for 6 weeks, 2.5 mg for 2 weeks, then 5 mg\/day for 6 weeks. Improvement was rated by a blinded independent evaluator. Because of small sample, data analysis was descriptive. Eighteen participants (10 mecamylamine, 8 placebo) completed the study. All doses were well tolerated; the only side effect of note was constipation (50% compared with 25% of placebo group). Three children had clinically nonsignificant electrocardiographic QT prolongation. Both groups showed modest to moderate improvement, but differences between groups were negligible. On the primary outcome measure, the Ohio Autism Clinical Impressions Scale, 90% of the active treatment group showed improvement at some point (but only 40% sustained it), compared with 62% on placebo. Of the four in active treatment that sustained improvement, three had a maximum dose of 0.13-0.15 mg\/kg\/day, while those who regressed had doses \u22650.18 mg\/kg\/day. Graphed means suggested better outcome with lower mg\/kg and longer medication duration. Four parents spontaneously reported reduced hyperactivity and irritability and better verbalization and continued mecamylamine at their own expense. Mecamylamine appeared to be safe, but not very effective in autism. The suggestion of better results at lower doses and longer exposure warrants consideration for future trials. The next step would be exploration of a more specific \u03b14\u03b22 nAChR agonist, such as varenicline.","122":"Robust clinical evidence has not been available for melatonin, a drug commonly administered for treating sleep problems of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In a phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, we administered 1-mg melatonin (n\u2009=\u200965), 4-mg melatonin (n\u2009=\u200965), or placebo (n\u2009=\u200966) to196 children with ASD once daily before bedtime under adequate sleep hygiene interventions. The primary outcome was sleep onset latency (SOL) assessed with the electronic sleep diary. SOL shortened significantly in the 1- and 4-mg melatonin groups compared to the placebo group (-\u00a022.0, -\u00a028.0, and -\u00a05.0\u00a0min, respectively; p\u2009<\u20090.0001 each). This therapeutic regimen of melatonin is a reasonable clinical approach to cope with ASD-emergent difficulties in children with ASD.","123":"Clinical evidence is required about the long-term efficacy and safety of melatonin treatment for sleep problems in children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) who underwent adequate sleep hygiene interventions. We conducted a 26-week, multicenter, collaborative, uncontrolled, open-label, phase III clinical trial of melatonin granules in children 6 to 15\u2009years of age who had NDDs and sleep problems. The study consisted of the 2-week screening phase, the 26-week medication phases I and II, and the 2-week follow-up phase. Children received 1, 2, or 4\u2009mg melatonin granules orally in the medication phases. Variables of sleep status including sleep onset latency (SOL), aberrant behaviors listed on the Aberrant Behavior Check List-Japanese version (ABC-J), and safety were examined. The primary endpoint was SOL in the medication phase I. Between June 2016 and July 2018, 99 children (80 males and 19 females, 10.4\u2009years in mean age) were enrolled at 17 medical institutions in Japan-74, 60, 22, 9, 6, and 1 of whom had autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder, intellectual disabilities, motor disorders, specific learning disorder, and communication disorders, respectively, at baseline. Fifteen children received the maximal dose of 4\u2009mg among the prespecified dose levels. SOL recorded with the electronic sleep diary shortened significantly (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation [SD], -\u200936.7\u2009\u00b1\u200946.1\u2009min; 95% confidence interval [CI], -\u200945.9 to -\u200927.5; P\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.0001) in the medication phase I from baseline, and the SOL-shortening effect of melatonin persisted in the medication phase II and the follow-up phase. Temper upon wakening and sleepiness after awakening improved significantly (P\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.0001 each) in the medication phase I from baseline and persisted in the follow-up phase. The following subscales of the ABC-J improved significantly: stereotypic behavior (P\u2009=\u20090.0322) in the medication phase I; and irritability, hyperactivity, and inappropriate speech (P\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.0001) in the medication phase II. Treatment-emergent adverse events did not occur subsequent to week 16 after medication onset, and NDDs did not deteriorate in the follow-up phase. Long-term melatonin treatment in combination with adequate sleep hygiene interventions may afford clinical benefits to children with NDDs and potentially elevates their well-being.

It is also associated with ritualistic and stereotypical behaviour. Recent studies propose both hyper-and hypoglutamatergic ideologies for autism. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of memantine plus risperidone in the treatment of children with autism. Children with autism were randomly allocated to risperidone plus memantine or placebo plus risperidone for a 10-wk, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The dose of risperidone was titrated up to 3\u00a0mg\/d and memantine was titrated to 20\u00a0mg\/d. Children were assessed at baseline and after 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 wk of starting medication protocol. The primary outcome measure was the irritability subscale of Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C). Difference between the two treatment arms was significant as the group that received memantine had greater reduction in ABC-C subscale scores for irritability, stereotypic behaviour and hyperactivity. Eight side-effects were observed over the trial, out of the 25 side-effects that the checklist included. The difference between the two groups in the frequency of side-effects was not significant. The present study suggests that memantine may be a potential adjunctive treatment strategy for autism and it was generally well tolerated. This trial is registered with the Iranian Clinical Trials Registry (IRCT1138901151556N10; www.irct.ir).","125":"Three phase 2 trials were conducted to assess the efficacy and long-term safety of weight-based memantine extended release (ER) treatment in children with autism spectrum disorder. MEM-MD-91, a 50-week open-label trial, identified memantine extended-release treatment responders for enrollment into MEM-MD-68, a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled withdrawal trial. MEM-MD-69 was an open-label extension trial in which participants from MEM-MD-68, MEM-MD-91, and open-label trial MEM-MD-67 were treated \u2a7d48\u2009weeks with memantine extended release. In MEM-MD-91, 517 (59.6%) participants were confirmed Social Responsiveness Scale responders at week 12; mean Social Responsiveness Scale total raw scores improved two to three times a minimal clinically important difference of 10 points. In MEM-MD-68, there was no difference between memantine and placebo on the primary efficacy parameter, the proportion of patients with a loss of therapeutic response (defined as \u2a7e10-point increase from baseline in Social Responsiveness Scale total raw score). MEM-MD-69 exploratory analyses revealed mean standard deviation improvement in Social Responsiveness Scale total raw score of 32.4 (26.4) from baseline of the first lead-in study. No new safety concerns were evident. While the a priori-defined efficacy results of the double-blind trial were not achieved, the considerable improvements in mean Social Responsiveness Scale scores from baseline in the open-label trials were presumed to be clinically important.","126":"Abnormal glutamatergic neurotransmission is implicated in the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this study, the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist memantine (once-daily extended-release [ER]) were investigated in children with autism in a randomized, placebo-controlled, 12 week trial and a 48 week open-label extension. A total of 121 children 6-12 years of age with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed., Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR)-defined autistic disorder were randomized (1:1) to placebo or memantine ER for 12 weeks; 104 children entered the subsequent extension trial. Maximum memantine doses were determined by body weight and ranged from 3 to 15\u2009mg\/day. There was one serious adverse event (SAE) (affective disorder, with memantine) in the 12 week study and one SAE (lobar pneumonia) in the 48 week extension; both were deemed unrelated to treatment. Other AEs were considered mild or moderate and most were deemed not related to treatment. No clinically significant changes occurred in clinical laboratory values, vital signs, or electrocardiogram (ECG). There was no significant between-group difference on the primary efficacy outcome of caregiver\/parent ratings on the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), although an improvement over baseline at Week 12 was observed in both groups. A trend for improvement at the end of the 48 week extension was observed. No improvements in the active group were observed on any of the secondary end-points, with one communication measure showing significant worsening with memantine compared with placebo (p\u2009=\u20090.02) after 12 weeks. This trial did not demonstrate clinical efficacy of memantine ER in autism; however, the tolerability and safety data were reassuring. Our results could inform future trial design in this population and may facilitate the investigation of memantine ER for other clinical applications.","127":"This report examined the effect of methylphenidate on social communication and self-regulation in children with pervasive developmental disorders and hyperactivity in a secondary analysis of RUPP Autism Network data. Participants were 33 children (29 boys) between the ages of 5 and 13 years who participated in a four-week crossover trial of placebo and increasing doses of methylphenidate given in random order each for one week. Observational measures of certain aspects of children's social communication, self-regulation, and affective behavior were obtained each week. A significant positive effect of methylphenidate was seen on children's use of joint attention initiations, response to bids for joint attention, self-regulation, and regulated affective state. The results go beyond the recent literature and suggest that methylphenidate may have positive effects on social behaviors in children with PDD and hyperactivity.","128":"To examine the psychometric properties of the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scales (CYBOCS) modified for pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs).

Reliability was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and internal consistency by Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Correlations with ratings of repetitive behavior and disruptive behavior were examined for validity. Eleven raters showed excellent reliability (ICC = 0.97). The mean CYBOCS score was 14.4 (+\/- 3.86) with excellent internal consistency (alpha = .85). Correlations with other measures of repetitive behavior ranged from r = 0.11 to r = 0.28 and were similar to correlations with measures of irritability (r = 0.24) and hyperactivity (r = 0.25). Children with higher scores on the CYBOCS-PDD had higher levels of maladaptive behaviors and lower adaptive functioning. The five-item CYBOCS-PDD is reliable, distinct from other measures of repetitive behavior, and sensitive to change.","129":"Thirteen children (ages 5.6 to 11.2 years) with autism and symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of methylphenidate (0.3 and 0.6 mg\/kg per dose). Eight subjects responded positively, based upon a minimum 50% decrease on the Conners Hyperactivity Index. Ratings of stereotypy and inappropriate speech, which are often associated with autistic core features, also decreased. However, no changes were found on the Child Autism Rating Scale, a global assessment of autistic symptomotology. Significant adverse side effects occurred in some children including social withdrawal and irritability, especially at the 0.6 mg\/kg dose. Results suggest that methylphenidate can be efficacious for children with autism and ADHD symptoms. However, this group of children seems to be particularly susceptible to adverse side effects.","130":"This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design study of the safety and efficacy of methylphenidate (MPH) in 11 preschool children (aged 4.0-5.11 years) with developmental disabilities and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). MPH doses of 0.3 and 0.6 mg\/kg per dose and a placebo were given. Drug response was evaluated via teacher-completed behavior checklists and clinic-based observations of activity level, attention, and compliance to adult requests. A side effects checklist was also completed by teachers and parents. Significant improvement on teacher ratings of hyperactivity and inattention as well as clinic-based observations of activity level and compliance were associated with MPH. Eight of 11 preschool children were medication responders (based on a minimum 40% decrease between placebo and one drug condition on either the teacher-rated Conners Hyperactivity Index or the Hyperactive-Distractible subscale of the Preschool Behavior Questionnaire). Five children exhibited significant adverse drug side effects such as severe social withdrawal, increased crying, and irritability, especially at the higher dose (0.6 mg\/kg). Results suggest that preschool children with developmental disabilities and ADHD respond to MPH at rates similar to those of school-age children with mental retardation and ADHD. However, this population appears to be especially susceptible to adverse drug side effects.","131":"Fifty-two children (ages 7 to 14 years) with moderate retardation to borderline intellectual functioning were recontacted 12 to 65 months following participation in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of methylphenidate (MPH). Sixty-nine percent of subjects continued to be prescribed medication for behavior control at follow-up. While 72% of the sample evidenced improvement, over two-thirds continued to be rated at or above the 98th percentile on the Hyperactivity Index of the Parent Conners. In fact, 22% of subjects had received inpatient psychiatric treatment between the time of the initial MPH trial and follow-up. Finally, subjects with high initial ratings on the Parent Conners Conduct Problems scale were more likely to be suspended from school or receive inpatient psychiatric treatment than subjects with low initial ratings. The results suggested that children with ADHD and mental retardation of borderline intellectual functioning continued to exhibit significant symptoms associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) at follow-up and that early conduct problems were predictive of continuing behavioral difficulties.","132":"The primary purpose of this study was to predict stimulant medication response among children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and mental retardation (MR). Forty-seven children with ADHD and MR (IQs of 48 to 77) served as subjects; ages ranged from 6.1 to 12.5 years. Subjects participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of two doses of methylphenidate (0.3 and 0.6 mg\/kg per dose) and a placebo. Data were collected in each child's weekday classroom and a Saturday laboratory classroom. Stepwise multiple regression analyses were used to predict drug responses in both settings. Higher parent ratings of impulsivity and activity level at baseline were associated with greater gains in weekday classroom dependent measures. Similarly, higher weekday teacher measures of activity level, impulsivity, inattention, and conduct problems at baseline were related to improvement on Saturday laboratory classroom dependent measures. Finally, gender, race, and socioeconomic status (SES) were found to be important predictors, with males, Caucasian subjects, and subjects from families of higher SES more likely to evidence clinical gains on a number of variables than other subjects. These results were generally consistent with research conducted among children with ADHD but without MR. However, factors such as race and conduct problems appear to have predictive utility specific to children with MR.","133":"Using a combination of an alternating treatment and double-blind placebo-controlled drug design, the independent and combined effects of two behavioral interventions and two doses of methylphenidate (MPH) in 3 children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and mental retardation (MR) were assessed. In this single subject design, 2 of the 3 subjects responded positively to medication as measured by increased on-task behavior. The first behavioral intervention, a token economy for on-task behavior, was ineffective for increasing either on-task behavior or work accuracy when combined with placebo. However, improvement in work accuracy was realized with implementation of a second behavioral intervention that specifically targeted accuracy independent of drug conditions. The current findings highlight both the positive effects and limitations of the two commonly used treatment modalities for ADHD. Future studies should continue to extend this area of investigative efforts to produce more data-based knowledge as to the appropriate doses of treatment, both pharmacological and behavioral, with children with both ADHD and mental retardation.","134":"Stimulant medication efficacy was evaluated in 14 children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and IQs of 48 to 74 in a double-blind crossover study of two methylphenidate doses and placebo. Dependent measures included behavioral ratings, work output, measures of learning, attention and impulsivity, and direct observation of peer social interactions. Nine children (64%) were methylphenidate-responders, based upon the Conners Hyperactivity Index. Significant gains in on-task behavior and attentional skills were noted with methylphenidate in comparison to placebo. No improvement on measures of learning or social interactions were observed. Results extend and replicate previous research conducted by the authors.","135":"The adverse side effects of methylphenidate were evaluated in 27 children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and IQs of 48 to 74 who participated in a double-blind study of two doses of methylphenidate and placebo. A checklist of 13 side effects, generated from the Physician's Desk Reference, was completed by teachers. Rates of irritability, anxiety, moodiness, and activity level decreased significantly when comparing the placebo with drug conditions. However, medication for six (22%) of the children was discontinued because of the appearance of motor tics (three children) and severe social withdrawal (two children), suggesting that mentally retarded children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may be at a greater risk for developing these side effects than the nonretarded population.","136":"Twelve children with IQ scores of 50 to 74 (educable mental retardation) who met rigorous diagnostic criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder participated in a double-blind crossover study of the efficacy of two doses of methylphenidate compared with placebo. Dependent measures included behavioral ratings, classroom work output, laboratory measures of attention and learning, and direct observations of social behavior. Improvement with medication on the Conners Hyperactivity Index was observed in 75% of subjects. Significant increases in work output, on-task behavior, and attentional skills were associated with methylphenidate. However, gains in measures of attention were not associated with improvement in learning, as measured by a paired associate learning task. Additionally, no significant increases in appropriate social interactions during free play were associated with methylphenidate. The results suggest that mentally retarded children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder respond to methylphenidate at similar rates and in similar domains to that of the nonretarded population.","137":"This study assessed the safety and efficacy of methylphenidate in children with seizures and attention-deficit disorder. Ten children, aged 6 years 10 months to 10 years 10 months, without seizures while receiving a single antiepileptic drug, were evaluated in a double-blind medication-placebo crossover study with methylphenidate hydrochloride was administered at 0.3 mg\/kg per dose and given at 8 AM and 12 PM on school days only. The use of methylphenidate was associated with statistically significant improvements on the Conners' Teacher Rating Scale and on the Finger Tapping Task and with trends toward improvement on the Matching Familiar Figures Test and Discriminant Reaction Time tests. No child had seizures during the study period nor subsequently for those who continued receiving psychostimulants. There were no significant changes of epileptiform features or back-ground activity on electroencephalograms and no alterations in antiepileptic drug levels. Methylphenidate may be a safe and effective treatment for certain children with seizures and concurrent attention-deficit disorder.","138":"The purpose of this study was to examine the behavioral effects of four doses of psychostimulant medication, combining extended-release methylphenidate (MPH) in the morning with immediate-release MPH in the afternoon. The sample comprised 24 children (19 boys; 5 girls) who met American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed. (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) on the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), and had significant symptoms of attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This sample consisted of elementary school-age, community-based children (mean chronological age=8.8 years, SD=1.7; mean intelligence quotient [IQ]=85; SD=16.8). Effects of four dose levels of MPH on parent and teacher behavioral ratings were investigated using a within-subject, crossover, placebo-controlled design. MPH treatment was associated with significant declines in hyperactive and impulsive behavior at both home and school. Parents noted significant declines in inattentive and oppositional behavior, and improvements in social skills. No exacerbation of stereotypies was noted, and side effects were similar to those seen in typically developing children with ADHD. Dose response was primarily linear in the dose range studied. The results of this study suggest that MPH formulations are efficacious and well-tolerated for children with ASD and significant ADHD symptoms.","139":"Individual variation in cognitive and behavioral response to methylphenidate (MPH) was investigated in children with mental retardation and attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder. Twenty-four children (mean age 10.9 years, SD = 2.4) participated in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial with 0.15-, 0.30-, and 0.60-mg\/kg b.i.d. doses of MPH. Parent and teacher behavioral ratings, as well as cognitive task performance, were assessed at each dose. Relative to placebo, most children with attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder and mental retardation showed some degree of behavioral and cognitive improvement with MPH treatment. However, fewer of these children made substantial gains (>30% improvement, relative to placebo) with MPH treatment. At the highest dose, 55% of the children showed substantial behavioral gains and 46% made substantial gains in cognitive task performance. However, there was substantial independence between changes in behavior and changes in cognitive performance. At the 0.60-mg\/kg MPH dose, more children showed substantial cognitive and behavioral gains than those who showed substantial declines in a ratio of more than 5:1. However, it may be prudent to assess cognitive change as well as behavioral effects because improvements in the former do not necessarily forecast improvements in the latter in children with attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder and mental retardation.","140":"Cognitive effects of stimulant medication were investigated in children with mental retardation (MR) and attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Performance on tasks tapping sustained attention, visual and auditory selective attention, inhibition, and immediate memory was assessed for 24 children (mean age 10.9 years) during a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover treatment trial with 0.15, 0.30, and 0.60 mg\/kg b.i.d. dosages of methylphenidate (MPH). Successively higher MPH doses were associated with consistent gains in cognitive task performance, with optimal performance noted at the highest dose. Analysis of dose-response curves revealed significant linear components of trend on measures tapping sustained attention, visual selective attention, auditory selective attention, as well as two tasks tapping inhibition\/impulsivity: delay of gratification and match-to-sample. No evidence of a curvilinear dose-response relationship emerged for any measure. Inattention and disinhibition\/impulsivity decline with MPH treatment in children with ADHD\/MR, and consistent with the Multimodal Treatment Study of ADHD, higher MPH doses are most effective. These findings also suggest that cognitive testing, together with behavioral and medical assessment, can be an effective tool in assessing stimulant response in children with ADHD\/MR.","141":"The effects of stimulant medication treatment were investigated in children with mental retardation (MR) and attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Parent and teacher behavioral ratings and reports of side effects were obtained for children (N = 24, mean age = 10.9 years, SD = 2.4) during a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover treatment trial with 0.15 mg\/kg, 0.30 mg\/kg, and 0.60 mg\/kg b.i.d. dosages of methylphenidate. The most significant improvements occurred at the 0.60 mg\/kg methylphenidate dose for teacher ratings of inattention (p =.024), hyperactivity (p <.001), aggression (p <.001), and asocial behavior (p =.009). No significant improvements, relative to placebo, occurred at the 0.15 mg\/kg dosage. Of interest, nearly all significant medication-related behavioral improvements were detected by teachers. However, parents were sensitive raters of side effects, noting more sleeping problems and loss of appetite at the 0.60 mg\/kg dose compared with placebo. These results suggest that symptoms of ADHD can be treated successfully in children with ADHD\/MR, and consistent with MTA study results, higher doses were most effective. Furthermore, these improvements were not accompanied by increases in symptoms such as staring, social withdrawal, or anxiety.","142":"This study investigated the utility of the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP), a computerized laboratory analog aggression measure. We measured the effects of methylphenidate (MPH) on aggressive responding in children with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), who had high ratings on the Child Behavior Checklist Aggression Factor (CBCL; Achenbach 1991). Results are reported for 6 subjects, ages 8-11 years. All were tested at baseline in an unmedicated condition, and after double-blind administration of placebo, 0.3 mg\/kg of MPH, and 0.6 mg\/kg of MPH. A main effect of decreased aggressive responding with MPH was found, with a dose-related change by repeated measures ANOVA (F = 6.59, df = 2.10, p = .014). Post-hoc analysis with the Tukey HSD indicated that only the 0.6 mg\/kg was significantly (p < .05) different than placebo. Implications for use of the PSAP in future investigations of medications in aggressive children are discussed.","143":"Response to atomoxetine, a nonstimulant norepinephrine-specific reuptake inhibitor, was compared with the effect of osmotic-release oral methylphenidate, a long-acting methylphenidate preparation, in patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In a large placebo-controlled, double-blind study, patients ages 6-16 with ADHD, any subtype, were randomly assigned to receive 0.8-1.8 mg\/kg per day of atomoxetine (N=222), 18-54 mg\/day of osmotically released methylphenidate (N=220), or placebo (N=74) for 6 weeks. The a priori specified primary analysis compared response (at least 40% decrease in ADHD Rating Scale total score) to osmotically released methylphenidate with response to atomoxetine and placebo. After 6 weeks, patients treated with methylphenidate were switched to atomoxetine under double-blind conditions. The response rates for both atomoxetine (45%) and methylphenidate (56%) were markedly superior to that for placebo (24%), but the response to osmotically released methylphenidate was superior to that for atomoxetine. Each medication was well tolerated, with completion rates and discontinuations for adverse events not significantly different from those for placebo. Of the 70 subjects who did not respond to methylphenidate, 30 (43%) subsequently responded to atomoxetine. Likewise, 29 (42%) of the 69 patients who did not respond to atomoxetine had previously responded to osmotically released methylphenidate. Response was significantly greater with osmotically released methylphenidate than with atomoxetine. One-third of patients who received methylphenidate followed by atomoxetine responded better to one or the other, suggesting that there may be preferential responders.","144":"The primary treatment for attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been psychostimulants. Recently developed nonpsychostimulant treatments have allowed certain patients to switch from a psychostimulant to a nonpsychostimulant. However, the outcomes of such switches have not been systematically studied. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess treatment tolerance and efficacy during a cross-taper transition from methylphenidate or amphetamine to atomoxetine among children and adolescents with ADHD. This pilot study was conducted in patients (aged 6-17 years) with incomplete responses (failure to obtain full reduction\/elimination of symptoms) or intolerance of adverse events (AEs) during psychostimulant treatment. Patients continued ongoing psychostimulant treatment during the first week of the study. Transition to atomoxetine began by administering atomoxetine 0.5 mg\/kg . d plus full-dose psychostimulant for 1 week, followed in the second week by 1.2 mg\/kg . d atomoxetine plus half-dose psychostimulant. Patients remained on 1.2 mg\/kg . d atomoxetine monotherapy for the remaining 5 weeks. This stepwise transition was enacted due to the difference in pharmacodynamics between the psychostimulants and atomoxetine. Applying a stepwise cross-titration allowed for better control of ADHD symptoms during the intervening period. Change in ADHD symptoms, as measured by the mean change in the Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-IV-Parent Version: Investigator-administered and -scored (ADHDRS-IV-Parent:Inv), was assessed from baseline to end point. Of the 62 subjects enrolled in the study, 39 (62.9%) were diagnosed as ADHD-combined type. Similar proportions were receiving methylphenidate (51.6%) and amphetamine (48.4%). Slightly more wished to switch due to inadequate response (53.2%) than intolerability (46.8%). Nine subjects discontinued at various times during the course of the study (patient or parent\/caregiver decision [4], AE [2], protocol violation [2], and lack of efficacy [1]). Mean (SD) ADHDRS-IV-Parent:Inv total scores (n = 59, last-observation-carried-forward) improved significantly from baseline (visit 2) to an end point (32.1 [10.5] vs 22.6 [14.0]; P < 0.001). Of the 58 subjects answering in the atomoxetine monotherapy phase, 38 (65.5%) reported a preference for atomoxetine treatment over their previous psychostimulant. Tolerability results were as follows: 26 (44.1%) of 59 patients reported >or=1 AE, the most common being somnolence (4 [6.8%]), fatigue (3 [5.1%]), decreased appetite (3 [5.1%]), cough (3 [5.1%]), headache (3 [5.1%]), and contact dermatitis (2 [3.4%]). No clinically severe AEs were reported. Both mean (SD) diastolic (2.4 [7.8] mm Hg; P = 0.031) and systolic (2.4 [7.9] mm Hg; P = 0.029) blood pressures increased significantly from baseline to end point. Electrocardiography revealed a significant increase in mean (SD) heart rate (9.2 [11.6] bpm; P < 0.001) and a corresponding decrease in mean (SD) RR interval (-77.8 [98.2] ms; P < 0.001). Statistically significant, but mild, increases in diastolic pressure and heart rate were observed. These children and adolescent patients were successfully switched from methylphenidate or amphetamine to atomoxetine treatment, with resulting improvement in ADHD symptom severity from baseline in this pilot study.","145":"The use of psychostimulants in autistic disorder has not received extensive evaluation. Furthermore, their use for the symptomatic control of autistic disorder has been felt to be contraindicated. This study investigates the use of methylphenidate (MPH) for the treatment of selected symptoms of autistic disorder. Ten children, ages 7-11, with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of autistic disorder participated in a double-blind crossover study using placebo and two MPH doses (10 mg or 20 mg bid). Subjects showed modest but statistically significant improvement on MPH over placebo. No significant side effects including worsening stereotypic movements occurred on either dose. Improvement in hyperactivity and lack of adverse effects suggest that MPH may be useful in the treatment of hyperactive autistic children.","146":"This study was a 10-week double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial of mirtazapine for anxiety in youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Participants were ages 5 to 17 years with ASD and clinically significant anxiety (Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale [PARS] score \u226510). Thirty participants were randomized to mirtazapine (7.5-45\u2009mg\/day) or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. The co-primary outcome measures were the PARS and the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement subscale (CGI-I). Mirtazapine resulted in a statistically significant within group decrease in anxiety on the PARS (ES 1.76, p\u2009<\u20090.001). The improvement in PARS score for mirtazapine versus placebo was clinically meaningful but not statistically significant (ES\u2009=\u20090.63, p\u2009=\u20090.64). Forty-seven percent of participants assigned to mirtazapine (95% CI 22%: 74%) and 20% assigned to placebo (95% CI 2%: 60%) were rated \"much improved\" (CGI-I\u2009=\u20092) or \"very much improved\" (CGI-I\u2009=\u20091) for anxiety, p\u2009=\u20090.46. No statistically significant differences in mean 10-week changes between mirtazapine and placebo occurred on any outcome measure. There were no statistically significant differences in adverse effect frequency between mirtazapine and placebo. The results are consistent with mirtazapine's safety and tolerability and meet three of four pre-specified indicators of efficacy (statistically significant change in total PARS score for mirtazapine, numerically greater reduction in total PARS score for mirtazapine than placebo, numerically higher number of responders to mirtazapine than placebo, but not greater than 50% of participants receiving mirtazapine rated as responders). Implementation of a larger randomized controlled trial of mirtazapine for the treatment of anxiety in this population is supported.Clinical trial registration information: Mirtazapine Treatment of Anxiety in Children and Adolescents with Pervasive Developmental Disorders; https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov ; NCT01302964.","147":"Prior neuroimaging clinical trials investigating the neural effects of intranasal administration of the neuropeptide oxytocin demonstrated a key role of the amygdala in oxytocin's neuromodulatory effects. These studies mostly demonstrated the acute effects of single-dose administrations, examining task-dependent effects of oxytocin on brain activity elicited during explicit experimental tasks or stimuli presentations. The increased consideration of oxytocin as a potential ameliorating treatment in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) requires a better understanding of how multiple-dose oxytocin administration affects intrinsic, task-free, amygdala function. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with between-subject design, 38 adult men with ASD underwent resting-state fMRI scanning before and after oxytocin or placebo treatment. Effects were assessed either after a single-dose administration, consisting of 24 international units, or after multiple-dose treatment, consisting of 4 weeks of once-daily nasal spray administrations. Compared to placebo, oxytocin induced a decrease in intrinsic resting-state BOLD signal amplitudes of the bilateral amygdala (fractional amplitudes of low-frequency fluctuations) and modulated cross-frequency interactions between adjacent BOLD frequency components. The right amygdala showed a pattern of reduced cross-frequency harmonicity, while the left amygdala showed a relative increase in harmonic cross-frequency interactions after oxytocin treatment. Notably, the direction and magnitude of BOLD spectral changes induced after a single-dose were qualitatively similar to treatment effects induced after multiple-dose treatment. Furthermore, the identified spectral changes in amygdalar BOLD amplitude and cross-frequency harmonicity were associated with improved feelings of tension, reflecting oxytocin's anxiolytic, stress-reducing neuromodulatory role. The observed effects of oxytocin on amygdalar BOLD spectral characteristics and associated behaviors contribute to a deeper mechanistic understanding of the intrinsic, task-free neuromodulatory dynamics that underlie single- and multiple-dose oxytocin treatment in ASD. European Clinical Trial Registry (Eudract 2014-000586-45).","148":"Intranasal administration of the neuropeptide oxytocin (IN-OT) is increasingly considered as a potential treatment for targeting the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but the effects of continual use on neural substrates are fairly unexplored and long-term effects are unknown. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, we investigated the effects of single-dose and multiple-dose IN-OT treatment (4 weeks of daily (24 IU) administrations) on brain activity related to processing emotional states. Thirty-eight adult men with ASD (aged between 18 and 35 years) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging of the posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTS) and amygdala regions while processing emotional states from point-light biological motion. In line with prior research, a single dose of IN-OT induced a reliable increase in pSTS brain activity during the processing of point-light biological motion, but no consistent long-term changes in pSTS activity were induced after the multiple-dose treatment. In terms of bilateral amygdala, the multiple-dose treatment induced a consistent attenuation in brain activity, which outlasted the period of actual administrations until four weeks and one year post-treatment. Critically, participants with stronger attenuations in amygdala-activity showed greater behavioral improvements, particularly in terms of self-reported feelings of avoidant attachment and social functioning. Together, these observations provide initial insights into the long-lasting neural consequences of chronic IN-OT use on amygdala functioning and provide first indications that the acute versus chronic effects of IN-OT administration may be qualitatively different. Larger studies are however warranted to further elucidate the long-term impact of IN-OT treatment on human neural substrates and its behavioral consequences.","149":"Intranasal administration of the neuropeptide oxytocin (IN-OT) is increasingly explored as a potential treatment for targeting the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To date, however, the impact of multiple-dose IN-OT treatment on human neural circuitry is largely unknown, and also the possibility that long-term IN-OT use may induce long-lasting neural adaptations remains unexplored. Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, between-subject design (including 38 adult men with ASD), this treatment-mechanism study showed that 4 weeks of daily oxytocin administration (24 IU\/day) significantly altered intrinsic (resting-state fMRI) functional connectivity of the amygdala to core regions of the \"social brain\" (particularly orbitofrontal cortex and superior temporal sulcus) up to 4 weeks and 1 year post treatment. The neural adaptations in functional coupling of the amygdala to the orbitofrontal cortex were associated with reduced feelings of avoidance toward others and-at the trend level-reduced repetitive behaviors. These observations contribute to a deeper mechanistic understanding of the neural substrates that underlie behavioral effects of multiple-dose IN-OT treatment, and provide initial insights into the long-lasting neural consequences of chronic IN-OT use on amygdala circuitry. Future studies are however warranted to further elucidate the long-term impact of IN-OT treatment on human neural circuitry and its behavioral consequences.","150":"Intranasal administration of the \"prosocial\" neuropeptide oxytocin is increasingly explored as a potential treatment for targeting the core characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, long-term follow-up studies, evaluating the possibility of long-lasting retention effects, are currently lacking. Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design, this pilot clinical trial explored the possibility of long-lasting behavioral effects of 4 weeks of intranasal oxytocin treatment (24 International Units once daily in the morning) in 40 adult men with ASD. To do so, self-report and informant-based questionnaires assessing core autism symptoms and characterizations of attachment were administered at baseline, immediately after 4 weeks of treatment (approximately 24 h after the last nasal spray administration), and at two follow-up sessions, 4 weeks and 1 year post-treatment. No treatment-specific effects were identified in the primary outcome assessing social symptoms (Social Responsiveness Scale, self- and informant-rated). In particular, with respect to self-reported social responsiveness, improvements were evident both in the oxytocin and in the placebo group, yielding no significant between-group difference (<i>p<\/i> = .37). Also informant-rated improvements in social responsiveness were not significantly larger in the oxytocin, compared to the placebo group (between-group difference: <i>p<\/i> = .19). Among the secondary outcome measures, treatment-specific improvements were identified in the Repetitive Behavior Scale and State Adult Attachment Measure, indicating reductions in self-reported repetitive behaviors (<i>p<\/i> = .04) and reduced feelings of avoidance toward others (<i>p<\/i> = .03) in the oxytocin group compared to the placebo group, up to 1 month and even 1 year post-treatment. Treatment-specific effects were also revealed in screenings of mood states (Profile of Mood States), indicating higher reports of \"vigor\" (feeling energetic, active, lively) in the oxytocin, compared to the placebo group (<i>p<\/i> = .03). While no treatment-specific improvements were evident in terms of core social symptoms, the current observations of long-term beneficial effects on repetitive behaviors and feelings of avoidance are promising and suggestive of a therapeutic potential of oxytocin treatment for ASD. However, given the exploratory nature of this pilot study, future studies are warranted to evaluate the long-term effects of OT administration further. The trial was registered with the European Clinical Trial Registry (Eudract 2014-000586-45) on January 22, 2014 (https:\/\/www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu\/ctr-search\/trial\/2014-000586-45\/BE).","151":"The neuropeptide 'oxytocin' (OT) is known to play a pivotal role in a variety of complex social behaviors by promoting a prosocial attitude and interpersonal bonding. Previous studies showed that a single-dose of exogenously administered OT can affect trust and feelings of attachment insecurity. With the present study, we explored the effects of two weeks of daily OT administration on measures of state and trait attachment using a double-blind between-subjects randomized placebo-controlled design. In 40 healthy young adult men state and trait attachment were assessed before and after two weeks of daily intranasal OT (24 IU) or placebo using the State Adult Attachment Scale and the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment. Mood, social responsiveness and quality of life were additionally assessed as secondary outcome measures. Reductions in attachment avoidance and increases in reports of attachment toward peers were reported after two weeks of OT treatment. Further, treatment-induced changes were most pronounced for participants with less secure attachment towards their peers. indicating that normal variance at baseline modulated treatment response. OT treatment was additionally associated with changes in mood, indicating decreases in feelings of tension and (tentatively) anger in the OT group, not in the placebo group. Further, at the end of the two-week trial, both treatment groups (OT, placebo) reported to experience an increase in social responsiveness and quality of life, but the effects were only specific to the OT-treatment in terms of reports on 'social motivation'. In summary, the observed improvements on state and trait dimensions of attachment after a multiple-dose treatment with OT provide further evidence in support of a pivotal role of OT in promoting the experience of attachment.","152":"Clozapine is the most effective antipsychotic for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, yet a significant proportion of individuals on clozapine continue to experience disabling symptoms, despite being treated with an adequate dose. There is a need for adjunct treatments to augment clozapine, notably for negative and cognitive symptoms. One such potential agent is the glutathione precursor N-acetylcysteine (NAC). A randomized double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled trial for clozapine patients with enduring psychotic symptoms (n = 84) was undertaken to investigate the efficacy of adjunctive NAC (2 g daily) for negative symptoms, cognition and quality of life (QoL). Efficacy was assessed at 8, 24, and 52 weeks. NAC did not significantly improve negative symptoms (P = .62), overall cognition (P = .71) or quality of life (Manchester quality of life: P = .11; Assessment of quality of life: P = .57) at any time point over a 1-year period of treatment. There were no differences in reported side effects between the groups (P = .26). NAC did not significantly improve schizophrenia symptoms, cognition, or quality of life in treatment-resistant patients taking clozapine.

We conducted a 20-week, multi-site, randomized controlled trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of the adjunctive use of NAC in OCD. The study was a phase III, 20-week, double-blind, randomized controlled trial across multiple sites in Australia investigating 2\u00a0g to 4\u00a0g per day of NAC (titrated according to response) in 98 participants with DSM-5 diagnosed OCD. Data were analysed using linear mixed effects models for the 89 participants who attended at least one follow-up visit. A modified intention-to-treat analysis of the primary outcome found no evidence that NAC reduced symptoms of OCD measured on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, relative to placebo (mean difference at week 20\u00a0=\u00a00.53, 95% compatibility interval\u00a0=\u00a0-2.18, 3.23; p\u00a0=\u00a00.70; favouring placebo). There was also no evidence that NAC, compared to placebo, improved outcomes on the secondary measures including anxiety, depression, quality of life, functioning, or clinician\/participant impression. NAC was well-tolerated with only mild gastrointestinal adverse events associated with the treatment. We found no evidence supporting the efficacy of the adjunctive use of NAC in OCD.","154":"Smoking represents a significant health threat to the population, however there remains a core group of consistent smokers that are largely unable to break the addiction. Novel therapies are required to assist this group with cessation. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a nutraceutical supplement that has shown efficacy compared to placebo in previous pilot studies for assisting smokers to quit or reduce their consumption of cigarettes. A double-blind, randomised trial with a treatment period of 16 weeks and a final follow-up at 42 weeks was conducted comparing 1.8g of effervescent NAC per day (n=47) with placebo (n=47) as an aide to smoking cessation. Both study arms received adjunctive online support through the QuitCoach program. Participants reported smoking at each timepoint (baseline and weeks 8, 16 & 42), which was confirmed through salivary cotinine and exhaled carbon monoxide testing. Primary and secondary analyses were undertaken using a modified intent-to-treat basis, including all participants with at least one valid post baseline outcome, regardless of treatment received or their withdrawal from the study. There was no significant difference in smoking outcomes between intervention groups among the 24 participants that competed follow-up. There were no significant differences in age, gender, or body mass index (BMI) between the groups lost to follow-up or recorded at follow-up. This study found no evidence to support NAC as a therapy for smoking cessation. The negative outcome could be the result of lack of treatment efficacy, or alternatively, small sample size, participant retention difficulties, dose, or duration of follow-up.

This has led to the investigation of NAC as a potential candidate for the treatment of BD. The aim of this study was to investigate metabolomic markers to identify predictors of NAC response in a cohort of BD participants. This study is a secondary analysis of a 16-week, multi-site, randomized, double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial in BD participants with a current acute depressive episode. This study included trial participants who received either NAC 2000\u00a0mg\/day, or placebo. Participants (NAC: n\u00a0=\u00a031, placebo: n\u00a0=\u00a029) were assessed at baseline and week 16 using the Montgomery \u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and were dichotomised into \"responders\" (MADRS at week 16\u00a0<\u00a050% of MADRS at baseline) and \"non-responders\" (MADRS at week 16\u00a0>\u00a050% at baseline). Untargeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was performed to analyse baseline levels of 68 serum metabolites. Of the nine metabolites that differentiated placebo and NAC groups, five were amino acids with lower levels in the NAC responder group compared with the NAC non-responders. Further analysis generated a predictive model of MADRS improvement including glycine, norleucine, threonine, proline, phenylalanine, tyrosine, glutamic acid, lysine and leucine (R<sup>2<\/sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.853; adjusted R<sup>2<\/sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.733). This prediction model predicted 85% of the variance in MADRS outcome after adjunctive treatment with NAC. BD participants with lower serum levels of free amino acids at baseline may be more likely to respond to adjunctive treatment with NAC.","156":"To investigate the efficacy of adjunctive N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for the treatment of acute bipolar depression. A randomized, double-blind, multicentre, placebo-controlled trial including adult subjects diagnosed with bipolar disorder, currently experiencing a depressive episode. Participants were treated with 3\u202fg\/day NAC or placebo as an adjunctive to standard treatment for 20 weeks, followed by a 4-week washout where the blinding was maintained. The primary outcome was the mean change in the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score over the 20-week treatment phase. Linear Mixed Effects Repeated Measures (LMERM) was used for analysing the primary outcome. A total of 80 subjects were included. The mean MADRS score at baseline was 30.1 and 28.8 in participants randomized to NAC and placebo, respectively. Regarding the primary outcome measure, the between-group difference (NAC vs. placebo) was 0.5, which was statistically non-significant (95% CI: -7.0-5.9;p\u202f=\u202f0.88). All findings regarding secondary outcomes were statistically or clinically insignificant. The study had a placebo response rate of 55.6% - high placebo response rates are associated with failure to separate from placebo. Based on our primary outcome measure, we could not confirm previous studies showing a therapeutic effect of adjunctive NAC treatment on acute bipolar depression. Further studies with larger samples are needed to elucidate if specific subgroups could benefit from adjunctive NAC treatment.","157":"A phasic dysregulation of mitochondrial bioenergetics may operate in bipolar disorder, increased in mania and decreased in depression. We aimed to examine efficacy of two add-on treatments in bipolar depression: N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and NAC with a combination of nutraceutical agents that may increase mitochondrial biogenesis. A three-arm 16-week, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, adjunctive to usual treatment, was conducted. Participants (n\u2009=\u2009181) with bipolar disorder and current depressive symptoms were randomised to 2000\u2009mg\/day NAC (n\u2009=\u200959), 2000\u2009mg\/day NAC with the combination nutraceutical treatment (CT, n\u2009=\u200961), or placebo (n\u2009=\u200961). The primary outcome was change in Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score from baseline to week 16. Young Mania Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-Improvement and CGI-Severity scales, Patient Global Impression scale, Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS), Longitudinal Interval Follow-Up Evaluation - Range of Impaired Functioning Tool (LIFE-RIFT), and Quality of Life Enjoyment, and Satisfaction Questionnaire Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF) were secondary outcomes. One hundred forty-eight participants had post-randomisation data and were analysed (NAC\u2009=\u200952, CT\u2009=\u200947, Placebo\u2009=\u200949). No between-group differences were found for the rate of change between baseline and 16\u2009weeks on any of the clinical and functioning variables. Improvements in MADRS, BDRS, SOFAS, and LIFE-RIFT scores from baseline to the week 20 post-discontinuation visit were significantly greater in the CT group compared to those in the placebo. At week 20, the CGI-I was significantly lower in the CT group versus placebo. Gastrointestinal symptoms were significantly greater in the NAC than in the placebo group. These overall negative results, with no significant differences between groups detected at the primary outcome but some positive secondary signals, suggest either delayed benefit of the combination or an improvement of symptoms on withdrawal which warrants further exploration regarding the composition, mechanisms, and application of mitochondrial agents in illnesses characterised by mitochondrial dysfunction.

This is a secondary analysis of a placebo-controlled randomised trial. Serum samples were collected at baseline, week 8, and week 32 of the open-label and maintenance phases of the clinical trial to determine changes in interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), C-reactive protein (CRP) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) following adjunctive NAC treatment, and to explore mediation and moderator effects of the listed markers. Levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukins (IL) -6, 8, or 10 were not significantly changed during the course of the trial or specifically in the open-label and maintenance phases. There were no mediation or moderation effects of the biological factors on the clinical parameters. The results suggest that these particular biological parameters may not be directly involved in the therapeutic mechanism of action of adjunctive NAC in bipolar depression.","159":"This study aimed to explore effects of adjunctive N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment on inflammatory and neurogenesis markers in unipolar depression. We embarked on a 12-week clinical trial of NAC (2000 mg\/day compared with placebo) as an adjunctive treatment for unipolar depression. A follow-up visit was conducted 4 weeks following the completion of treatment. We collected serum samples at baseline and the end of the treatment phase (week 12) to determine changes in interleukin-6 (IL6), C-reactive protein (CRP) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) following NAC treatment. NAC treatment significantly improved depressive symptoms on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) over 16 weeks of the trial. Serum levels of IL6 were associated with reductions of MADRS scores independent of treatment response. However, we found no significant changes in IL6, CRP and BDNF levels following NAC treatment. Overall, this suggests that our results failed to support the hypothesis that IL6, CRP and BDNF are directly involved in the therapeutic mechanism of NAC in depression. IL6 may be a useful marker for future exploration of treatment response.","160":"Clozapine is an effective treatment for a proportion of people with schizophrenia (SZ) who are resistant to the beneficial effects of other antipsychotic drugs. However, anything from 40-60\u00a0% of people on clozapine experience residual symptoms even on adequate doses of the medication, and thus could be considered 'clozapine resistant'. Agents that could work alongside clozapine to improve efficacy whilst not increasing the adverse effect burden are both desired and necessary to improve the lives of individuals with clozapine-resistant SZ. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is one such possible agent. Previous research from our research group provided promising pilot data suggesting the efficacy of NAC in this patient population. The aim of the study reported here is to expand this work by conducting a large scale clinical trial of NAC in the treatment of clozapine-resistant SZ. This study is an investigator initiated, multi-site, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. It aims to include 168 patients with clozapine-resistant SZ, divided into an intervention group (NAC) and a control group (placebo). Participants in the intervention group will receive 2\u00a0g daily of NAC. The primary outcome measures will be the negative symptom scores of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Secondary outcome measures will include: changes in quality of life (QoL) as measured by the Lancashire Quality of Life Profile (LQoLP) and cognitive functioning as measured by the total score on the MATRICS. Additionally we will examine peripheral and cortical glutathione (GSH) concentrations as process outcomes. This large scale clinical trial will investigate the efficacy of NAC as an adjunctive medication to clozapine. This trial, if successful, will establish a cheap, safe and easy-to-use agent (NAC) as a 'go to' adjunct in patients that are only partly responsive to clozapine.

Cognition may be affected across a range of domains, including memory, psychomotor skills, and executive function. Whilst the exact mechanisms of cognitive change after surgery are not precisely known, oxidative stress and subsequent neuroinflammation have been implicated. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) acts via multiple interrelated mechanisms to influence oxidative homeostasis, neuronal transmission, and inflammation. NAC has been shown to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in both human and animal models. There is clinical evidence to suggest that NAC may be beneficial in preventing the cognitive decline associated with both acute physiological insults and dementia-related disorders. To date, no trials have examined perioperative NAC as a potential moderator of postoperative cognitive changes in the noncardiac surgery setting. This is a single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, with a between-group, repeated-measures, longitudinal design. The study will recruit 370 noncardiac surgical patients at the University Hospital Geelong, aged 60\u00a0years or older. Participants are randomly assigned to receive either NAC or placebo (1:1 ratio), and groups are stratified by age and surgery type. Participants undergo a series of neuropsychological tests prior to surgery, 7\u00a0days, 3\u00a0months, and 12\u00a0months post surgery. It is hypothesised that the perioperative administration of NAC will reduce the degree of postoperative cognitive changes at early and long-term follow-up, as measured by changes on individual measures of the neurocognitive battery, when compared with placebo. Serum samples are taken on the day of surgery and on day 2 post surgery to quantitate any changes in levels of biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress. The PANACEA trial aims to examine the potential efficacy of perioperative NAC to reduce the severity of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in an elderly, noncardiac surgery population. This is an entirely novel approach to the prevention of postoperative cognitive dysfunction and will have high impact and translatable outcomes if NAC is found to be beneficial.

Eleven patients with a diagnosis of either autism, Asperger's syndrome, or PDD not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) and aged 6-14 years were randomized into an 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel treatment study with olanzapine. There was a significant linear trend x group interaction on the Clinical Global Impressions- Improvement (CGI-I) and 50% on olanzapine versus 20% on placebo were responders. Olanzapine was associated with significant weight gain (7.5 +\/- 4.8 lbs vs. 1.5 +\/- 1.5 lbs on placebo). Olanzapine may be a promising treatment for improving global functioning of PDDs, but the risk of significant weight gain remains a concern.

We sought to examine the feasibility of a novel, Internet-based clinical trial design to evaluate the efficacy of this supplement. E-mail invitations were sent to parents of children aged 5 to 8 years enrolled in the Interactive Autism Network. All study procedures, including screening, informed consent, and collection of outcome measures took place over the Internet. The primary outcome measures were parent- and teacher-rated changes in hyperactivity on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC-H). During the 6-week recruitment period, 57 children from 28 states satisfied all eligibility criteria and were randomly assigned to 1.3 grams of omega-3 fatty acids or an identical placebo daily for 6 weeks. Outcome assessments were obtained from all 57 participants and 57 teachers, and the study was completed in 3 months. Children in the omega-3 fatty acid group had a greater reduction in hyperactivity (-5.3 points) compared to the placebo group (-2.6 points), but the difference was not statistically significant (1.9-point greater improvement in the omega-3 group, 95% CI = -2.2 to 5.2). Adverse events were rare and not associated with omega-3 fatty acids. Participant feedback was positive. Internet-based, randomized controlled trials of therapies in children with ASD are feasible and may lead to marked reductions in the time and cost of completing trials. A larger sample size is required to definitively determine the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids.

Correlations were found between decreases in five fatty acid levels and decreases in hyperactivity, and the treatment was well tolerated. Although this pilot study did not find a statistically significant benefit from omega-3 fatty acids, the small sample size does not rule out small to moderate beneficial effects.","165":"An imbalance in the excitatory\/inhibitory systems with abnormalities in the glutamatergic pathways has been implicated in the pathophysiology of autism. Furthermore, chronic redox imbalance was also recently linked to this disorder. The goal of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility of using oral N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a glutamatergic modulator and an antioxidant, in the treatment of behavioral disturbance in children with autism. This was a 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of NAC in children with autistic disorder. Subjects randomized to NAC were initiated at 900 mg daily for 4 weeks, then 900 mg twice daily for 4 weeks and 900 mg three times daily for 4 weeks. The primary behavioral measure (Aberrant Behavior Checklist [ABC] irritability subscale) and safety measures were performed at baseline and 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Secondary measures included the ABC stereotypy subscale, Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised, and Social Responsiveness Scale. Thirty-three subjects (31 male subjects, 2 female subjects; aged 3.2-10.7 years) were randomized in the study. Follow-up data was available on 14 subjects in the NAC group and 15 in the placebo group. Oral NAC was well tolerated with limited side effects. Compared with placebo, NAC resulted in significant improvements on ABC irritability subscale (F = 6.80; p < .001; d = .96). Data from this pilot investigation support the potential usefulness of NAC for treating irritability in children with autistic disorder. Large randomized controlled investigations are warranted.","166":"Oxytocin (OT), the brain's most abundant neuropeptide, plays an important role in social salience and motivation. Clinical trials of the efficacy of OT in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have reported mixed results due in part to ASD's complex etiology. We investigated whether genetic and epigenetic variation contribute to variable endogenous OT levels that modulate sensitivity to OT therapy. To carry out this analysis, we integrated genome-wide profiles of DNA-methylation, transcriptional activity, and genetic variation with plasma OT levels in 290 participants with ASD enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of OT. Our analysis identified genetic variants with novel association with plasma OT, several of which reside in known ASD risk genes. We also show subtle but statistically significant association of plasma OT levels with peripheral transcriptional activity and DNA-methylation profiles across several annotated gene sets. These findings broaden our understanding of the effects of the peripheral oxytocin system and provide novel genetic candidates for future studies to decode the complex etiology of ASD and its interaction with OT signaling and OT-based interventions. LAY SUMMARY: Oxytocin (OT) is an abundant chemical produced by neurons that plays an important role in social interaction and motivation. We investigated whether genetic and epigenetic factors contribute to variable OT levels in the blood. To this, we integrated genetic, gene expression, and non-DNA regulated (epigenetic) signatures with blood OT levels in 290 participants with autism enrolled in an OT clinical trial. We identified genetic association with plasma OT, several of which reside in known autism risk genes. We also show statistically significant association of plasma OT levels with gene expression and epigenetic across several gene pathways. These findings broaden our understanding of the factors that influence OT levels in the blood for future studies to decode the complex presentation of autism and its interaction with OT and OT-based treatment.","167":"Experimental studies and small clinical trials have suggested that treatment with intranasal oxytocin may reduce social impairment in persons with autism spectrum disorder. Oxytocin has been administered in clinical practice to many children with autism spectrum disorder. We conducted a 24-week, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial of intranasal oxytocin therapy in children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with autism spectrum disorder. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, with stratification according to age and verbal fluency, to receive oxytocin or placebo, administered intranasally, with a total target dose of 48 international units daily. The primary outcome was the least-squares mean change from baseline on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist modified Social Withdrawal subscale (ABC-mSW), which includes 13 items (scores range from 0 to 39, with higher scores indicating less social interaction). Secondary outcomes included two additional measures of social function and an abbreviated measure of IQ. Of the 355 children and adolescents who underwent screening, 290 were enrolled. A total of 146 participants were assigned to the oxytocin group and 144 to the placebo group; 139 and 138 participants, respectively, completed both the baseline and at least one postbaseline ABC-mSW assessments and were included in the modified intention-to-treat analyses. The least-squares mean change from baseline in the ABC-mSW score (primary outcome) was -3.7 in the oxytocin group and -3.5 in the placebo group (least-squares mean difference, -0.2; 95% confidence interval, -1.5 to 1.0; P\u2009=\u20090.61). Secondary outcomes generally did not differ between the trial groups. The incidence and severity of adverse events were similar in the two groups. This placebo-controlled trial of intranasal oxytocin therapy in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder showed no significant between-group differences in the least-squares mean change from baseline on measures of social or cognitive functioning over a period of 24 weeks.

The current double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, crossover trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03466671) was aimed to test the effect of TTA-121, a new formulation of intranasal oxytocin spray with an enhanced bioavailability (3.6 times higher than Syntocinon\u00ae spray, as assessed by area under the concentration-time curve in rabbit brains), which enabled us to test a wide range of multiple doses, on autism spectrum disorder core symptoms and to determine the dose-response relationship. Four-week administrations of TTA-121, at low dose once per day (3 U\/day), low dose twice per day (6 U\/day), high dose once per day (10 U\/day), or high dose twice per day (20 U\/day), and 4-week placebo were administered in a crossover manner. The primary outcome was the mean difference in the reciprocity score (range: 0-14, higher values represent worse outcomes) on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule between the baseline and end point of each administration period. This trial with two administration periods and eight groups was conducted at seven university hospitals in Japan, enrolling adult males with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder. Enrolment began from June 2018 and ended December 2019. Follow-up ended March 2020. Of 109 males with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder who were randomized, 103 completed the trial. The smallest P-value, judged as the dose-response relationship, was the contrast with the peak at TTA-121 6 U\/day, with inverted U-shape for both the full analysis set (P = 0.182) and per protocol set (P = 0.073). The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule reciprocity score, the primary outcome, was reduced in the TTA-121 6 U\/day administration period compared with the placebo (full analysis set: P = 0.118, mean difference = -0.5; 95% CI: -1.1 to 0.1; per protocol set: P = 0.012, mean difference = -0.8; 95% CI: -1.3 to -0.2). The per protocol set was the analysis target population, consisting of all full analysis set participants except those who deviated from the protocol. Most dropouts from the full analysis set to the per protocol set occurred because of poor adherence to the test drug (9 of 12 in the first period and 8 of 15 in the second period). None of the secondary clinical and behavioural outcomes were significantly improved with the TTA-121 compared with the placebo in the full analysis set. A novel intranasal spray of oxytocin with enhanced bioavailability enabled us to test a wide range of multiple doses, revealing an inverted U-shape dose-response curve, with the peak at a dose that was lower than expected from previous studies. The efficacy of TTA-121 shown in the current exploratory study should be verified in a future large-scale, parallel-group trial.","169":"Oxytocin is expected as a novel therapeutic agent for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) core symptoms. However, previous results on the efficacy of repeated administrations of oxytocin are controversial. Recently, we reported time-course changes in the efficacy of the neuropeptide underlying the controversial effects of repeated administration; however, the underlying mechanisms remained unknown. The current study explored metabolites representing the molecular mechanisms of oxytocin's efficacy using high-throughput metabolomics analysis on plasma collected before and after 6-week repeated intranasal administration of oxytocin (48\u00a0IU\/day) or placebo in adult males with ASD (N\u2009=\u2009106) who participated in a multi-center, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial. Among the 35 metabolites measured, a significant increase in N,N-dimethylglycine was detected in the subjects administered oxytocin compared with those given placebo at a medium effect size (false discovery rate (FDR) corrected P\u2009=\u20090.043, d\u2009=\u20090.74, N\u2009=\u200983). Furthermore, subgroup analyses of the participants displaying a prominent time-course change in oxytocin efficacy revealed a significant effect of oxytocin on N,N-dimethylglycine levels with a large effect size (P<sub>FDR<\/sub>\u2009=\u20090.004, d\u2009=\u20091.13, N\u2009=\u200960). The increase in N,N-dimethylglycine was significantly correlated with oxytocin-induced clinical changes, assessed as changes in quantifiable characteristics of autistic facial expression, including both of improvements between baseline and 2\u00a0weeks (P<sub>FDR<\/sub>\u2009=\u20090.006, r\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.485, N\u2009=\u200943) and deteriorations between 2 and 4\u00a0weeks (P<sub>FDR<\/sub>\u2009=\u20090.032, r\u2009=\u20090.415, N\u2009=\u200937). The metabolites changes caused by oxytocin administration were quantified using peripheral blood and therefore may not directly reflect central nervous system changes. Our findings demonstrate an association of N,N-dimethylglycine upregulation with the time-course change in the efficacy of oxytocin on autistic social deficits. Furthermore, the current findings support the involvement of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor and neural plasticity to the time-course change in oxytocin's efficacy.

However, current treatments do not significantly ameliorate social impairments in CHR-P individuals. Given its critical role in social behaviour and cognition, the oxytocinergic (OT) system is a promising target for novel interventions in CHR-P subjects. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, 30 CHR-P males were studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on two occasions, once after 40IU self-administered intranasal OT and once after placebo. A modified version of the Sally-Anne task was used to assess brain activation during inferring others' beliefs and social emotions. The Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test was acquired prior to the first scan to test whether OT effects were moderated by baseline social-emotional abilities. OT did not modulate behavioural performances but reduced activation in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus compared with placebo while inferring others' social emotions. Furthermore, the relationship between brain activation and task performance after OT administration was moderated by baseline social-emotional abilities. While task accuracy during inferring others' social emotion increased with decreasing activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus in CHR-P individuals with low social-emotional abilities, there was no such relationship in CHR-P individuals with high social-emotional abilities. Our findings may suggest that acute OT administration enhances neural efficiency in the inferior frontal gyrus during inferring others' social emotions in those CHR-P subjects with low baseline social-emotional abilities.","171":"Discrepancies in efficacy between single-dose and repeated administration of oxytocin for autism spectrum disorder have led researchers to hypothesize that time-course changes in efficacy are induced by repeated administrations of the peptide hormone. However, repeatable, objective, and quantitative measurement of autism spectrum disorder's core symptoms are lacking, making it difficult to examine potential time-course changes in efficacy. We tested this hypothesis using repeatable, objective, and quantitative measurement of the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. We examined videos recorded during semi-structured social interaction administered as the primary outcome in single-site exploratory (n = 18, crossover within-subjects design) and multisite confirmatory (n = 106, parallel-group design), double-blind, placebo-controlled 6-week trials of repeated intranasal administrations of oxytocin (48 IU\/day) in adult males with autism spectrum disorder. The main outcomes were statistical representative values of objectively quantified facial expression intensity in a repeatable part of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule: the maximum probability (i.e. mode) and the natural logarithm of mode on the probability density function of neutral facial expression and the natural logarithm of mode on the probability density function of happy expression. Our recent study revealed that increases in these indices characterize autistic facial expression, compared with neurotypical individuals. The current results revealed that oxytocin consistently and significantly decreased the increased natural logarithm of mode on the probability density function of neutral facial expression compared with placebo in exploratory (effect-size, -0.57; 95% CI, -1.27 to 0.13; P = 0.023) and confirmatory trials (-0.41; -0.62 to -0.20; P < 0.001). A significant interaction between time-course (at baseline, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks) and the efficacy of oxytocin on the natural logarithm of mode on the probability density function of neutral facial expression was found in confirmatory trial (P < 0.001). Post hoc analyses revealed maximum efficacy at 2 weeks (P < 0.001, Cohen's d = -0.78; 95% CI, -1.21 to -0.35) and deterioration of efficacy at 4 weeks (P = 0.042, Cohen's d = -0.46; 95% CI, -0.90 to -0.01) and 6 weeks (P = 0.10, Cohen's d = -0.35; 95% CI, -0.77 to 0.08), while efficacy was preserved at 2 weeks post-treatment (i.e. 8 weeks) (P < 0.001, Cohen's d = -1.24; 95% CI, -1.71 to -0.78). Quantitative facial expression analyses successfully verified the positive effects of repeated oxytocin on autistic individuals' facial expressions and demonstrated a time-course change in efficacy. The current findings support further development of an optimized regimen of oxytocin treatment.","172":"A discrepancy in oxytocin's behavioral effects between acute and repeated administrations indicates distinct underlying neurobiological mechanisms. The current study employed a combination of human clinical trial and animal study to compare neurochemical changes induced by acute and repeated oxytocin administrations. Human study analyzed medial prefrontal metabolite levels by using <sup>1<\/sup>H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, a secondary outcome in our randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of 6 weeks intranasal administrations of oxytocin (48\u2009IU\/day) and placebo within-subject design in 17 psychotropic-free high-functioning men with autism spectrum disorder. Medial prefrontal transcript expression levels were analyzed in adult male C57BL\/6J mice after intraperitoneal injection of oxytocin or saline either once (200\u2009ng\/100\u2009\u03bcL\/mouse, n\u2009=\u200912) or for 14 consecutive days (200\u2009ng\/100\u2009\u03bcL\/mouse\/day, n\u2009=\u200916). As the results, repeated administration of oxytocin significantly decreased the medial prefrontal N-acetylaspartate (NAA; p\u2009=\u20090.043) and glutamate-glutamine levels (Glx; p\u2009=\u20090.001), unlike the acute oxytocin. The decreases were inversely and specifically associated (r\u2009=\u20090.680, p\u2009=\u20090.004 for NAA; r\u2009=\u20090.491, p\u2009=\u20090.053 for Glx) with oxytocin-induced improvements of medial prefrontal functional MRI activity during a social judgment task not with changes during placebo administrations. In wild-type mice, we found that repeated oxytocin administration reduced medial frontal transcript expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor type 2B (p\u2009=\u20090.018), unlike the acute oxytocin, which instead changed the transcript expression associated with oxytocin (p\u2009=\u20090.0004) and neural activity (p\u2009=\u20090.0002). The present findings suggest that the unique sensitivity of the glutamatergic system to repeated oxytocin administration may explain the differential behavioral effects of oxytocin between acute and repeated administration.","173":"Although small-scale studies have described the effects of oxytocin on social deficits in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), no large-scale study has been conducted. In this randomized, parallel-group, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in Japan, 106 ASD individuals (18-48 y.o.) were enrolled between Jan 2015 and March 2016. Participants were randomly assigned to a 6-week intranasal oxytocin (48IU\/day, n\u2009=\u200953) or placebo (n\u2009=\u200953) group. One-hundred-three participants were analyzed. Since oxytocin reduced the primary endpoint, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) reciprocity, (from 8.5 to 7.7; P\u2009<\u2009.001) but placebo also reduced the score (8.3 to 7.2; P\u2009<\u2009.001), no between-group difference was found (effect size -0.08; 95% CI, -0.46 to 0.31; P\u2009=\u2009.69); however, plasma oxytocin was only elevated from baseline to endpoint in the oxytocin-group compared with the placebo-group (effect size -1.12; -1.53 to -0.70; P\u2009<\u2009.0001). Among the secondary endpoints, oxytocin reduced ADOS repetitive behavior (2.0 to 1.5; P\u2009<\u2009.0001) compared with placebo (2.0 to 1.8; P\u2009=\u2009.43) (effect size 0.44; 0.05 to 0.83; P\u2009=\u2009.026). In addition, the duration of gaze fixation on socially relevant regions, another secondary endpoint, was increased by oxytocin (41.2 to 52.3; P\u2009=\u2009.03) compared with placebo (45.7 to 40.4; P\u2009=\u2009.25) (effect size 0.55; 0.10 to 1.0; P\u2009=\u2009.018). No significant effects were observed for the other secondary endpoints. No significant difference in the prevalence of adverse events was observed between groups, although one participant experienced temporary gynecomastia during oxytocin administration. Based on the present findings, we cannot recommend continuous intranasal oxytocin treatment alone at the current dose and duration for treatment of the core social symptoms of high-functioning ASD in adult men, although this large-scale trial suggests oxytocin's possibility to treat ASD repetitive behavior.","174":"Autism spectrum disorder is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder with no established pharmacological treatment for its core symptoms. Although previous literature has shown that single-dose administration of oxytocin temporally mitigates autistic social behaviours in experimental settings, it remains in dispute whether such potentially beneficial responses in laboratories can result in clinically positive effects in daily life situations, which are measurable only in long-term observations of individuals with the developmental disorder undergoing continual oxytocin administration. Here, to address this issue, we performed an exploratory, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial including 20 high-functional adult males with autism spectrum disorder. Data obtained from 18 participants who completed the trial showed that 6-week intranasal administration of oxytocin significantly reduced autism core symptoms specific to social reciprocity, which was clinically evaluated by Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (P = 0.034, PFDR < 0.05, Cohen's d = 0.78). Critically, the improvement of this clinical score was accompanied by oxytocin-induced enhancement of task-independent resting-state functional connectivity between anterior cingulate cortex and dorso-medial prefrontal cortex (rho = -0.60, P = 0.011), which was measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Moreover, using the same social-judgement task as used in our previous single-dose oxytocin trial, we confirmed that the current continual administration also significantly mitigated behavioural and neural responses during the task, both of which were originally impaired in autistic individuals (judgement tendency: P = 0.019, d = 0.62; eye-gaze effect: P = 0.03, d = 0.56; anterior cingulate activity: P = 0.00069, d = 0.97; dorso-medial prefrontal activity: P = 0.0014, d = 0.92; all, PFDR < 0.05). Furthermore, despite its longer administration, these effect sizes of the 6-week intervention were not larger than those seen in our previous single-dose intervention. These findings not only provide the evidence for clinically beneficial effects of continual oxytocin administration on the core social symptoms of autism spectrum disorder with suggesting its underlying biological mechanisms, but also highlight the necessity to seek optimal regimens of continual oxytocin treatment in future studies.","175":"Recent studies have suggested oxytocin's therapeutic effects on deficits in social communication and interaction in autism spectrum disorder through improvement of emotion recognition with direct emotional cues, such as facial expression and voice prosody. Although difficulty in understanding of others' social emotions and beliefs under conditions without direct emotional cues also plays an important role in autism spectrum disorder, no study has examined the potential effect of oxytocin on this difficulty. Here, we sequentially conducted both a case-control study and a clinical trial to investigate the potential effects of oxytocin on this difficulty at behavioural and neural levels measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging during a psychological task. This task was modified from the Sally-Anne Task, a well-known first-order false belief task. The task was optimized for investigation of the abilities to infer another person's social emotions and beliefs distinctively so as to test the hypothesis that oxytocin improves deficit in inferring others' social emotions rather than beliefs, under conditions without direct emotional cues. In the case-control study, 17 males with autism spectrum disorder showed significant behavioural deficits in inferring others' social emotions (P = 0.018) but not in inferring others' beliefs (P = 0.064) compared with 17 typically developing demographically-matched male participants. They also showed significantly less activity in the right anterior insula and posterior superior temporal sulcus during inferring others' social emotions, and in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex during inferring others' beliefs compared with the typically developing participants (P < 0.001 and cluster size > 10 voxels). Then, to investigate potential effects of oxytocin on these behavioural and neural deficits, we conducted a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover within-subject trial for single-dose intranasal administration of 24 IU oxytocin in an independent group of 20 males with autism spectrum disorder. Behaviourally, oxytocin significantly increased the correct rate in inferring others' social emotions (P = 0.043, one-tail). At the neural level, the peptide significantly enhanced the originally-diminished brain activity in the right anterior insula during inferring others' social emotions (P = 0.004), but not in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex during inferring others' beliefs (P = 0.858). The present findings suggest that oxytocin enhances the ability to understand others' social emotions that have also required second-order false belief rather than first-order false beliefs under conditions without direct emotional cues in autism spectrum disorder at both the behaviour and neural levels.","176":"Sociocommunicational deficits make it difficult for individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) to understand communication content with conflicting verbal and nonverbal information. Despite growing prospects for oxytocin as a therapeutic agent for ASD, no direct neurobiological evidence exists for oxytocin's beneficial effects on this core symptom of ASD. This is slowing clinical application of the neuropeptide. To directly examine whether oxytocin has beneficial effects on the sociocommunicational deficits of ASD using both behavioral and neural measures. At the University of Tokyo Hospital, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject-crossover, single-site experimental trial in which intranasal oxytocin and placebo were administered. A total of 40 highly functioning men with ASD participated and were randomized in the trial. Single-dose intranasal administration of oxytocin (24 IU) and placebo. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined effects of oxytocin on behavioral neural responses of the participants to a social psychological task. In our previous case-control study using the same psychological task, when making decisions about social information with conflicting verbal and nonverbal contents, participants with ASD made judgments based on nonverbal contents less frequently with longer time and could not induce enough activation in the medial prefrontal cortex. Therefore, our main outcomes and measures were the frequency of the nonverbal information-based judgments (NVJs), the response time for NVJs, and brain activity of the medial prefrontal cortex during NVJs. Intranasal oxytocin enabled the participants to make NVJs more frequently (P =\u2009.03) with shorter response time (P =\u2009.02). During the mitigated behavior, oxytocin increased the originally diminished brain activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (P <\u2009.001). Moreover, oxytocin enhanced functional coordination in the area (P <\u2009.001), and the magnitude of these neural effects was predictive of the behavioral effects (P \u2264 .01). These findings provide the first neurobiological evidence for oxytocin's beneficial effects on sociocommunicational deficits of ASD and give us the initial account for neurobiological mechanisms underlying any beneficial effects of the neuropeptide. umin.ac.jp\/ctr Identifier: UMIN000002241 and UMIN000004393.","177":"Inflammation, autoimmunity, and gut-brain axis have been implicated in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Carboxyhemoglobin (SpCO) as a non-invasive measurement of inflammation has not been studied in individuals with ASD. We conducted this post-hoc study based on our published clinical trial to explore SpCO and its association with ASD severity, autoimmunity, and response to daily Lactobacillus plantarum probiotic supplementation. In this study, we included 35 individuals with ASD aged 3-20\u00a0years from a previously published clinical trial of the probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive daily Lactobacillus plantarum probiotic (6\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>10<\/sup> CFUs) or a placebo for 16\u00a0weeks. The outcomes in this analysis include Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), Aberrant Behavior Checklist second edition (ABC-2), Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, SpCO measured by CO-oximetry, fecal microbiome by 16\u00a0s rRNA sequencing, blood serum inflammatory markers, autoantibodies, and oxytocin (OT) by ELISA. We performed Kendall's correlation to examine their interrelationships and used Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare the means of all outcomes between the two groups at baseline and 16\u00a0weeks. Elevated levels of serum anti-tubulin, CaM kinase II, anti-dopamine receptor D1 (anti-D1), and SpCO were found in the majority of ASD subjects. ASD severity is correlated with SpCO (baseline, R\u2009=\u20090.38, p\u2009=\u20090.029), anti-lysoganglioside GM1 (R\u2009=\u20090.83, p\u2009=\u20090.022), anti-tubulin (R\u2009=\u20090.69, p\u2009=\u20090.042), and anti-D1 (R\u2009=\u20090.71, p\u2009=\u20090.045) in treatment group. The findings of the present study suggests that the easily administered and non-invasive SpCO test offers a potentially promising autoimmunity and inflammatory biomarker to screen\/subgroup ASD and monitor the treatment response to probiotics. Furthermore, we propose that the associations between autoantibodies, gut microbiome profile, serum OT level, GI symptom severity, and ASD core symptom severity scores are specific to the usage of probiotic treatment in our subject cohort. Taken together, these results warrant further studies to improve ASD early diagnosis and treatment outcomes.

Both probiotics and oxytocin were reported to have therapeutic potential; however, the combination therapy has not yet been studied. We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 2-stage pilot trial in 35 individuals with ASD aged 3-20 years (median = 10.30 years). Subjects were randomly assigned to receive daily <i>Lactobacillus plantarum<\/i> PS128 probiotic (6 \u00d7 10<sup>10<\/sup> CFUs) or a placebo for 28 weeks; starting on week 16, both groups received oxytocin. The primary outcomes measure socio-behavioral severity using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC). The secondary outcomes include measures of the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, fecal microbiome, blood serum inflammatory markers, and oxytocin. All outcomes were compared between the two groups at baseline, 16 weeks, and 28 weeks into treatment. We observed improvements in ABC and SRS scores and significant improvements in CGI-improvement between those receiving probiotics and oxytocin combination therapy compared to those receiving placebo (<i>p<\/i> < 0.05). A significant number of favorable gut microbiome network hubs were also identified after combination therapy (<i>p<\/i> < 0.05). The favorable social cognition response of the combination regimen is highly correlated with the abundance of the Eubacterium hallii group. Our findings suggest synergic effects between probiotics PS128 and oxytocin in ASD patients, although further investigation is warranted.","179":"Individuals with autistic disorder (autism) frequently exhibit significant irritability marked by severe tantrums, aggression, and self-injury. Despite advances in the treatment of this symptom domain in autism, there remains an ongoing need for more effective and better tolerated pharmacotherapies. The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness and tolerability of paliperidone for irritability in autism. This is a prospective, 8-week open-label study of paliperidone in 25 adolescents and young adults with autism. Primary outcome measures included the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) Scale and the Irritability subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC-I). Concomitant medications (except antipsychotics) were permitted if dosages were stable for \u22652 months. Twenty-one (84 %) of 25 subjects ages 12-21 years (mean 15.3 years) responded to paliperidone, based on a CGI-I Scale score of 1 or 2 (very much or much improved) and \u226525 % improvement on the ABC-I. The mean final dosage of paliperidone was 7.1 mg\/day (range 3-12 mg\/day). Two subjects discontinued paliperidone prior to study completion (moderate sedation, n\u2009=\u20091; nonresponse, n\u2009=\u20091). Mild-to-moderate extrapyramidal symptoms were recorded in four subjects. A mean weight gain of 2.2 \u00b1 2.6 kg (range -3.6 to +7.9 kg) was recorded. Mean age- and sex-normed body mass index increased from 23.6 to 24.2 (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.001). Mean serum prolactin increased from 5.3 to 41.4 ng\/mL (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.0001). Paliperidone treatment was associated with significant improvement in irritability and was generally well tolerated. Larger scale, placebo-controlled studies are needed to elucidate the efficacy and tolerability of paliperidone in this population.","180":"Negative symptoms of schizophrenia represent an unmet therapeutic need for many patients in whom pentoxifylline may be effective in terms of its dopaminergic, anti-inflammatory, and cerebral blood flow-increasing properties. This study aimed to evaluate pentoxifylline as a therapeutic agent for improving negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Chronic schizophrenia outpatients experiencing significant negative symptoms were randomly allocated to receive pentoxifylline 400\u00a0mg or matched placebo every 12 hours for 8 weeks. All patients were clinically stable as they had received risperidone for at least 2 months, which was continued. The participants were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale, and side effect checklist. The patients' baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups. There was a significant time-treatment interaction effect on PANSS negative subscale scores (\u03b7P2=0.075), with the pentoxifylline group showing significantly greater reductions until weeks 4 (Cohen d = 0.512) and 8 (Cohen d = 0.622). Also, this group showed a significantly better response by week 8. Other PANSS scores, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores, Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale scores, and side effect frequencies were comparable between the groups. Pentoxifylline showed a nonsignificant higher remission of 37.1% compared with 14.7% in the placebo group. Pentoxifylline was safely and tolerably beneficial for the primary negative symptoms of chronic schizophrenia.","181":"There are several lines of evidence to indicate that the immune system plays an important role in the pathophysiology of autism. The objective of this study was to access the effects of pentoxifylline plus risperidone in the treatment of autistic disorder. Forty children between the ages 4 and 12 years with a DSM IV-TR clinical diagnosis of autism were recruited. The children presented with a chief complaint of severely disruptive symptoms related to autistic disorder. Patients were randomly allocated to pentoxifylline+risperidone or placebo+risperidone for a 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The dose of risperidone was titrated up to 3 mg\/day, pentoxifylline was titrated to 600 mg\/day. Patients were assessed at baseline and after 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks of starting medication. The measure of the outcome was the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C). The difference between the two protocols was significant as the group that received pentoxifylline had greater reduction in ABC-C subscale scores for Irritability, Lethargy\/Social Withdrawal, Stereotypic Behavior, Hyperactivity\/Noncompliance and Inappropriate Speech. The results suggest that combination of atypical antipsychotic medications and pentoxifylline might have synergistic effects in treatment of behavioral problems of children with autism.","182":"It has been reported that autism is a hypoglutamatergic disorder. Therefore, it was of interest to assess the efficacy of piracetam, a positive modulator of AMPA-sensitive glutamate receptors in autistic disorder. About 40 children between the ages three and 11 years (inclusive) with a DSM IV clinical diagnosis of autism and who were outpatients from a specialty clinic for children were recruited. The children presented with a chief complaint of severely disruptive symptoms related to autistic disorder. Patients were randomly allocated to piracetam + risperidone (Group A) or placebo + risperidone (Group B) for a 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The dose of risperidone was titrated up to 2 mg\/day for children between 10 and 40 kg and 3 mg\/day for children weighting above 40 kg. The dose of piracetam was titrated up to 800 mg\/day. Patients were assessed at baseline and after 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks of starting medication. The measure of the outcome was the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) Rating Scale (total score). The ABC-C Rating Scale scores improved with piracetam. The difference between the two protocols was significant as indicated by the effect of group, the between subjects factor (F = 5.85, d.f. = 1, P = 0.02). The changes at the endpoint compared with baseline were: -11.90 +\/- 3.79 (mean +\/- SD) and -5.15 +\/- 3.04 for group A and B respectively. A significant difference was observed on the change in scores in the ABC-C Rating Scale in week 10 compared with baseline in the two groups (t = 6.017, d.f. = 38, P < 0.0001). The results suggest that a combination of atypical antipsychotic medications and a glutamate agent such as piracetam, might have increase synergistic effects in the treatment of autism.","183":"Different dietary approaches, such as gluten and casein free diets, or the use of probiotics and prebiotics have been suggested in autistic spectrum disorders in order to reduce gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances. GI symptoms are of particular interest in this population due to prevalence and correlation with the severity of behavioural traits. Nowadays, there is lack of strong evidence about the effect of dietary interventions on these problems, particularly prebiotics. Therefore, we assessed the impact of exclusion diets and a 6-week Bimuno\u00ae galactooligosaccharide (B-GOS\u00ae) prebiotic intervention in 30 autistic children. The results showed that children on exclusion diets reported significantly lower scores of abdominal pain and bowel movement, as well as lower abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. and Veillonellaceae family, but higher presence of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bacteroides spp. In addition, significant correlations were found between bacterial populations and faecal amino acids in this group, compared to children following an unrestricted diet. Following B-GOS\u00ae intervention, we observed improvements in anti-social behaviour, significant increase of Lachnospiraceae family, and significant changes in faecal and urine metabolites. To our knowledge, this is the first study where the effect of exclusion diets and prebiotics has been evaluated in autism, showing potential beneficial effects. A combined dietary approach resulted in significant changes in gut microbiota composition and metabolism suggesting that multiple interventions might be more relevant for the improvement of these aspects as well as psychological traits.

We recruited 11 patients with MDD and gave them PS128 for 8 weeks. We compared depression symptoms, serum markers of inflammation and gut permeability, and gut microbiota before and after 8-week intervention and also explored the correlations among symptoms, biomarkers, and gut microbiota. After 8-week PS128 intervention, scores of Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 and Depression and Somatic symptoms Scale significantly decreased. Serum levels of high sensitivity c-reactive protein, interluekin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, zonulin and intestinal fatty acid binding protein, and the composition of gut microbiota did not significantly change after 8-week PS128 intervention. However, we found changes of some genera were correlated with changes of symptoms and biomarkers. In conclusion, this is an open trial with small sample size and has several limitations.

This study examined the long-term effects of PedPRM treatment on sleep, growth, body mass index, and pubertal development. Eighty children and adolescents (2-17.5 years of age; 96% with autism spectrum disorder) who completed the double-blind, placebo-controlled trial were given 2 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg PedPRM nightly up to 104 weeks, followed by a 2-week placebo period to assess withdrawal effects. Improvements in child sleep disturbance and caregiver satisfaction with child sleep patterns, quality of sleep, and quality of life were maintained throughout the 104-week treatment period (p\u00a0< .001 versus baseline for all). During the 2-week withdrawal placebo period, measures declined compared with the treatment period but were still improved compared with baseline. PedPRM was generally safe; the most frequent treatment-related adverse events were fatigue (6.3%), somnolence (6.3%), and mood swings (4.2%). Changes in mean weight, height, body mass index, and pubertal status (Tanner staging done by a physician) were within normal ranges for age with no evidence of delay in body mass index or pubertal development. Nightly PedPRM at optimal dose (2, 5, or 10 mg nightly) is safe and effective for long-term treatment in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder and insomnia.

A total of 125 children and adolescents (2-17.5 years of age; 96.8% ASD, 3.2% Smith-Magenis syndrome [SMS]) whose sleep failed to improve on behavioral intervention alone were randomized (1:1 ratio), double-blind, to receive PedPRM (2 mg escalated to 5 mg) or placebo for 13 weeks. Sleep measures included the validated caregivers' Sleep and Nap Diary (SND) and Composite Sleep Disturbance Index (CSDI). The a priori primary endpoint was SND-reported total sleep time (TST) after 13 weeks of treatment. The study met the primary endpoint: after 13 weeks of double-blind treatment, participants slept on average 57.5 minutes longer at night with PedPRM compared to 9.14 minutes with placebo (adjusted mean\u00a0treatment difference PedPRM-placebo\u00a0-32.43 minutes; p\u00a0= .034).

However, it is unknown whether GT affects disposition of hydrophilic anti-allergic drugs. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine are affected by catechins, major GT components. A randomized, open, 2-phase crossover study was conducted in 10 healthy Japanese volunteers. After overnight fasting, subjects were simultaneously administered fexofenadine (60\u2009mg) and pseudoephedrine (120\u2009mg) with an aqueous solution of green tea extract (GTE) containing (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) of ~\u2009300\u2009mg or water (control). In vitro transport assays were performed using HEK293 cells stably expressing organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1A2 to evaluate the inhibitory effect of EGCG on OATP1A2-mediated fexofenadine transport. In the GTE phase, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and the amount excreted unchanged into urine for 24\u2009hours of fexofenadine were significantly decreased by 70% (P\u2009<\u20090.001) and 67% (P\u2009<\u20090.001), respectively, compared with control. There were no differences in time to maximum plasma concentration and the elimination half-life of fexofenadine between phases. Fexofenadine was confirmed to be a substrate of OATP1A2, and EGCG (100 and 1,000\u2009\u03bcM) and GTE (0.1 and 1\u2009mg\/mL) inhibited OATP1A2-mediated uptake of fexofenadine. On the contrary, the concomitant administration of GTE did not influence the pharmacokinetics of pseudoephedrine. These results suggest that intake of GT may result in a markedly reduced exposure of fexofenadine, but not of pseudoephedrine, putatively by inhibiting OATP1A2-mediated intestinal absorption.","192":"Propranolol for infantile hemangiomas (IH) has been shown to be effective and relatively safe.

To document the noninferiority and safety of oral nadolol compared with oral propranolol in infants with IH. This double-blind noninferiority prospective study with a noninferiority margin of 10% compared propranolol with nadolol in infants aged 1 to 6 months with problematic IH. The study was conducted in 2 academic pediatric dermatology centers in Canada between 2016 and 2020. Infants aged 1 to 6 months with a hemangioma greater than 1.5 cm on the face or 3 cm or greater on another body part causing or with potential to cause functional impairment or cosmetic disfigurement.

Of these, 36 were treated with propranolol. The mean (SD) age in this group was 3.1 (1.4) months, and 31 individuals (86%) were female. Thirty-five infants were treated with nadolol. The mean (SD) age in this group was 3.2 (1.6) months, and 26 individuals (74%) were female. The difference in IH between groups by t test was 8.8 (95% CI, 2.7-14.9) for size and 17.1 (95% CI, 7.2-30.0) for color in favor of the nadolol group, demonstrating that nadolol was noninferior to propranolol. Similar differences were noted at 52 weeks: 6.0 (95% CI, 1.9-10.1) and 10.1 (95% CI, 2.9-17.4) for size and color improvement, respectively. For each doubling of time unit (week), the coefficient of involution was 2.4 (95% CI, 0.5-4.4) higher with nadolol compared with propranolol. Safety data were similar between the 2 interventions. Oral nadolol was noninferior to oral propranolol, indicating it may be an efficacious and safe alternative in cases of propranolol unresponsiveness or adverse events, or when faster involution is required.

Green tea consumption may reduce the risk of cardiovascular outcomes and total mortality, whereas green tea or its catechin components has been reported to decrease plasma concentrations of a hydrophilic \u03b2 blocker, nadolol, in humans. The aim of this study was to evaluate possible effects of green tea extract (GTE) on the lisinopril pharmacokinetics.

These results suggest that the extent of intestinal absorption of lisinopril was significantly impaired in the presence of GTE, whereas it had no major effect on the absorption rate and renal excretion of lisinopril. Concomitant use of lisinopril and green tea may decrease oral exposure to lisinopril, and therefore result in reduced therapeutic efficacy.","194":"The adoptive transfer of donor-derived virus-specific T cells (VSTs) is an effective treatment for infections following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Acute exercise mobilizes effector lymphocytes and VSTs to the circulation and augments the ex vivo manufacture of VSTs.

Circulating AdV and EBV VSTs (VSTs\/mL blood) only increased after exercise with placebo. Although not significant, nadolol partially mitigated exercise-induced increases in multi-VST expansion, particularly in participants that demonstrated an exercise-induced increase in VST expansion. We conclude that exercise-induced enhancements in VST mobilization and expansion are at least partially \u03b2<sub>2<\/sub> AR mediated, thus highlighting a role for the \u03b2<sub>2<\/sub> AR in targeted therapy for the augmentation of VST immune cell therapeutics in the allogeneic adoptive transfer setting.

There were no differences in time to maximal plasma concentration and renal clearance of nadolol among groups.

Autonomic nervous system measures and functional connectivity between language\/associative processing regions and within the fronto-parietal control, dorsal attention, and default mode networks were examined. Propranolol was associated with improved semantic fluency performance, which was correlated with the baseline resting heart rate. Propranolol also altered network efficiency of regions associated with semantic processing and in an exploratory analysis reduced functional differences in the fronto-parietal control network in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Thus, the cognitive benefits from <i>beta-<\/i>adrenergic antagonism may be generally associated with improved information processing in the brain in domain-specific networks, but individuals with autism spectrum disorder may also benefit from additional improvements in domain-general networks. The benefits from propranolol may also be able to be predicted from baseline autonomic nervous system measures, which warrants further investigation.","197":"Acute exercise preferentially mobilizes cytotoxic T-cells, NK-cells and non-classical monocytes to the bloodstream under the influence of hemodynamic forces and\/or \u03b2<sub>2<\/sub>-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2<sub>2<\/sub>-AR) signaling. However, the relative contribution of these mechanisms to the redeployment of the most exercise-responsive cell types is largely unknown.

Bisoprolol was administered to reduce hemodynamic forces (heart rate and blood pressure) during exercise to levels comparable with nadolol but without blocking \u03b2<sub>2<\/sub>-ARs. The mobilization of total NK-cells, terminally differentiated (CD57+) NK-cells, central memory, effector memory and CD45RA+ effector memory CD8+ T-cells; non-classical monocytes; and \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells were significantly blunted or abrogated under nadolol compared to both bisoprolol and placebo, indicating that the exercise-induced mobilization of these cell types to the blood is largely influenced by \u03b2<sub>2<\/sub>-AR signaling. Nadolol failed to inhibit the mobilization of classical monocytes, CD4+ T-cells (and their subsets) or na\u00efve CD8+ T-cells, indicating that these cell types are mobilized with exercise independently of the \u03b2<sub>2<\/sub>-AR. We conclude that the preferential mobilization of NK-cells, non-classical monocytes and differentiated subsets of CD8+ T-cells with exercise is largely dependent on catecholamine signaling through the \u03b2<sub>2<\/sub>-AR. These findings provide mechanistic insights by which distinct lymphocyte and monocyte subtypes are preferentially mobilized to protect the host from anticipated injury or infection in response to an acute stress response.","198":"The aim of the present study is to investigate a possible role of a single dose of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the major catechin in green tea, for the pharmacokinetic interaction between green tea and nadolol in humans.

Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of nadolol were determined up to 48\u00a0h. In addition, blood pressure and pulse rate were monitored. In vitro transport kinetic experiments were performed using human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably expressing organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1A2 to evaluate the inhibitory effect of EGCG on OATP1A2-mediated substrate transport. Single coadministration of low and high dose GTE significantly reduced the plasma concentrations of nadolol. The geometric mean ratios with 90% CI for area under the plasma concentration-time curves from 0 to infinity of nadolol were 0.72 (0.56-0.87) for the low and 0.60 (0.51-0.69) for the high dose. There were no significant differences in T<sub>max<\/sub>, elimination half-life, and renal clearance between GTE and water phases.

We assessed whether guiding therapy with hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) monitoring may improve survival by preventing VRB. Patients with cirrhosis with controlled variceal bleeding were randomized to an HVPG-guided therapy group (N\u2009=\u200984) or to a control group (N\u2009=\u200986). In both groups, HVPG and acute \u03b2-blocker response were evaluated at baseline and HVPG measurements were repeated at 2-4 weeks to determine chronic response. In the HVPG-guided group, acute responders were treated with nadolol and acute nonresponders with nadolol+nitrates. Chronic nonresponders received nadolol+prazosin and had a third HVPG study. Ligation sessions were repeated until response was achieved. The control group was treated with nadolol+nitrates+ligation. Between-group baseline characteristics were similar. During long-term follow-up (median of 24 months), mortality was lower in the HVPG-guided therapy group than in the control group (29% vs. 43%; hazard ratio [HR]\u2009=\u20090.59; 95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u20090.35-0.99). Rebleeding occurred in 19% versus 31% of patients, respectively (HR\u2009=\u20090.53; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.29-0.98), and further decompensation of cirrhosis occurred in 52% versus 72% (HR\u2009=\u20090.68; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.46-0.99). The survival probability was higher with HVPG-guided therapy than in controls, both in acute (HR\u2009=\u20090.59; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.32-1.08) and chronic nonresponders (HR\u2009=\u20090.48; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.23-0.99). HVPG-guided patients had a greater reduction of HVPG and a lower final value than controls (P\u2009<\u20090.05). HVPG monitoring, by stratifying risk and targeting therapy, improves the survival achieved with currently recommended treatment to prevent VRB using \u03b2-blockers and ligation. HVPG-guided therapy achieved a greater reduction in PP, which may have contributed to reduce the risk of rebleeding and of further decompensation of cirrhosis, thus contributing to a better survival.

Noncardioselective \u03b2-blockers not only reduce portal hypertension and prevent variceal bleeding in cirrhosis but also impair glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in other settings. This study aimed to determine whether nonselective \u03b2-blockade with nadolol impairs glucose metabolism in liver cirrhosis. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of nadolol in cirrhotic patients examined insulin sensitivity, disposition index, and glucose tolerance. Stable cirrhotic patients of mixed etiology underwent an intravenous glucose tolerance test and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp for the measurement of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity (n\u00a0=\u00a016) and a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (n\u00a0=\u00a017). These measurements were conducted twice (after 3\u00a0months of treatment with nadolol or placebo and, after a 1-month washout period, after 3\u00a0months on the alternative treatment). Total body fat and plasma catecholamines were measured at the end of each 3-month treatment. Compared with placebo, nadolol treatment reduced insulin sensitivity (79.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.1 vs 99.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.3\u00a0\u03bcL\/kg fat-free mass\u00b7min<sup>-1<\/sup> \u00b7(mU\/L)<sup>-1<\/sup> , P\u00a0=\u00a0.005).

Specifically, autistic people demonstrated hyperplasticity in response to theta-burst stimulation (TBS). We hypothesized that autistic adults would display hyperplasticity to TBS and that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) - which potentiates brain inhibitory mechanisms - would 'stabilize' hyperplasticity. Using a randomized, cross-over design, plasticity was assessed using TBS in the left motor cortex (M1) in 31 autistic adults and 30 sex-, intelligence quotient-, and age-matched controls. Autistic adults (n\u202f=\u202f29) were further randomized (1:1) to receive a single session of active (n\u202f=\u202f14) or sham (n\u202f=\u202f15) rTMS (6000 pulses at 20\u202fHz) over left M1 and plasticity was reassessed on the next day following rTMS. Both long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) were significantly increased in the ASD group, indicating hyperplasticity. Active, but not sham rTMS, attenuated LTD in autistic adults. We provided further evidence for the presence of brain hyperplasticity in ASD. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show preliminary evidence that an excessive LTD in ASD can be 'stabilized' using rTMS. Such 'stabilizing' effect of rTMS on LTP was not observed, likely due to small sample size or a more specific 'attenuating' effect of rTMS on LTD, compared to LTP. These findings indicate atypical brain inhibitory mechanisms behind hyperplasticity in ASD. Utilizing a larger sample, future replication studies could investigate therapeutic opportunities of 'mechanism-driven' rTMS.","202":"In youth and young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), executive function (EF) deficits may be a promising treatment target with potential impact on everyday functioning. To conduct a pilot randomized, double-blind, parallel, controlled trial evaluating repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for EF deficits in ASD. In Toronto, Ontario (November 2014 to June 2017), a 20-session, 4-week course of 20\u00a0Hz rTMS targeting dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (90%RMT) was compared to sham stimulation in 16-35 year-olds with ASD (28 male\/12 female), without intellectual disability, who had impaired everyday EF performance (n\u00a0=\u00a020 active\/n\u00a0=\u00a020 sham). Outcome measures evaluated protocol feasibility and clinical effects of active vs. sham rTMS on EF performance. The moderating effect of baseline functioning was explored. Of eligible participants, 95% were enrolled and 95% of randomized participants completed the protocol. Adverse events across treatment arms were mild-to-moderate. There was no significant difference between active vs. sham rTMS on EF performance. Baseline adaptive functioning moderated the effect of rTMS, such that participants with lower baseline functioning experienced significant EF improvement in the active vs. sham group. Our pilot RCT demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of using high frequency rTMS targeting DLPFC in youth and young adults with autism. No evidence for efficacy of active versus sham rTMS on EF performance was found. However, we found promising preliminary evidence of EF performance improvement following active versus sham rTMS in participants with ASD with more severe adaptive functioning deficits.

Further, there are no effective, neuroscience-based treatments to address this impairing feature of ASD. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has demonstrated promise in addressing EF deficits in adult neuropsychiatric disorders. This article will outline the design of a novel randomized-controlled trial of bilateral, 20\u2009Hz, rTMS applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for treatment of EF deficits in ASD that is currently ongoing. We describe prior therapeutic rTMS research for ASD and prior rTMS trials targeting EFs in adult neuropsychiatric disorders. A neurophysiological rationale for rTMS treatment of EF deficits in ASD is presented. An ongoing protocol will enroll participants aged 16-35 with ASD and no intellectual disability. Psychotropic medications will be continued during the 4-week trial of active 20\u2009Hz versus sham rTMS applied to the DLPFC. Twenty, active treatment sessions consisting of 25 stimulation trains at a 90% motor threshold will be administered. The primary outcome measure is the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) spatial working memory task. At present, recruitment, enrollment, and treatment within the described clinical trial are ongoing. EF deficits are common and impairing symptoms of ASD. There are no evidence-based treatments for EF deficits in ASD. The protocol described here will provide important preliminary data on the feasibility and efficacy of 20\u2009Hz rTMS to DLPFC for EF deficits in ASD.","204":"The underlying pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been linked to immune dysregulation, oxidative stress and excitation-inhibition imbalance. Among associated symptoms of ASD, management of irritability has gained considerable attention as it complicates adjustment of ASD patients and thus necessitates its pharmacological treatment. Resveratrol is a plant phytoalexin, which has been demonstrated to have neuroprotective effects through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial was designed to assess the potential therapeutic effects of resveratrol plus risperidone on irritability of ASD patients. Sixty-two patients were assigned randomly into two groups of resveratrol and placebo. Both groups were treated with risperidone twice daily starting at a dose of 0.5\u00a0mg with a dose increase of 0.5\u00a0mg per week (for the first 3\u00a0weeks). Resveratrol dosage was 250\u00a0mg twice per day from the beginning of the study. Using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C), patients were assessed for ASD-related behavioural symptoms at baseline, week 5 and week 10. The frequency of adverse events was recorded using a checklist containing 25 possible side effects, including general, gastrointestinal, neurological and cardiovascular complications. Improvements in primary outcome measure (irritability) and three secondary outcome measures (lethargy\/social withdrawal, stereotypic behaviour and inappropriate speech subscales) in the resveratrol group were statistically similar to those in the placebo group. The repeated measures analysis showed no time\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0treatment interaction on these subscale scores. In contrast, patients in the resveratrol group showed greater decline in hyperactivity\/non-compliance score as a secondary outcome measure (mean difference [CI\u00a0=\u00a095%]\u00a0=\u00a04.51 [0.10-8.92], t\u00a0=\u00a02.04; P\u00a0=\u00a0.04), and repeated measures analysis showed significant effect for time\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0treatment effect on this subscale score (F\u00a0=\u00a03.81; df\u00a0=\u00a01.30; P\u00a0=\u00a0.043). There was no significant difference in number and severity of adverse events between the two groups. This clinical trial demonstrated no significant effect for adjunctive treatment with resveratrol on irritability of patients with ASD. However, it provided preliminary evidence indicating that resveratrol could improve hyperactivity\/non-compliance of ASD patients.","205":"Riluzole is a glutamatergic modulator of particular interest in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover pilot study we evaluated the safety and tolerability of 5-week of adjunctive riluzole treatment (vs. 5-week of placebo, with 2-week washout period) targeting ASD-associated drug-refractory irritability in eight individuals age 12-25\u00a0years. All participants tolerated riluzole 200\u00a0mg per day, however there were no statistically significant findings for the overall treatment effect, the treatment effect by week within period of the study, or a cross-over effect across the periods of the study on the Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale or the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability subscale. The results of this trial indicate that 5-week of riluzole treatment was well tolerated, but had no significant effect on the target symptoms. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT02081027, Registered 5 August 2013, First participant enrolled 19 September 2013.","206":"Glutamatergic dysregulation is implicated in the pathophysiology of fragile X syndrome (FXS). Riluzole is hypothesized to have an inhibitory effect on glutamate release, block excitotoxic effects of glutamate, and potentiate postsynaptic GABA(A) receptor function. Extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) activation is known to be delayed in humans with FXS and knockout animal models of FXS. Correction of delayed ERK activation is a potential biomarker of treatment response in FXS. We conducted a six-week open-label prospective pilot study of riluzole (100 mg\/day) in six adults with FXS. Riluzole was started at 50mg every evening and then increased to 50mg twice daily at week 2. The dose was kept constant for the final 4 weeks of the trial. Clinical response was determined by a score of 1 \"very much improved\" or 2 \"much improved\" on the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement (CGI-I) scale and a\u226525% improvement on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for Pervasive Developmental Disorders. The primary target of treatment in this study was repetitive, compulsive behavior that commonly occurs in persons with FXS. The study incorporated an ERK activation biomarker assay. Potential adverse effects were assessed in a systematic manner at all clinic visits and by phone between visits. Riluzole treatment was associated with clinical response in 1 of 6 subjects (17%). Among a number of secondary outcome measures employed, significant improvement was only noted on the ADHD Rating Scale-IV (became non-significant when corrected for multiple comparisons). Riluzole use was associated with significant correction in ERK activation time in all subjects (mean change from 3.82\u00b10.27 (baseline) to 2.99\u00b10.26 (endpoint) minutes; p=0.007). Riluzole was well tolerated; mean increases in liver function tests occurred but drug discontinuation was not required. Overall, riluzole use was not associated with significant clinical improvement despite uniform correction of peripheral ERK activation. Future directions of study include testing of riluzole in animal models of FXS and assessment of psychotropic monotherapy on ERK activation.","207":"A hyperglutamatergic state has been shown to play a possible role in the pathophysiology of autistic disorders. Riluzole is a glutamate-modulating agent with neuroprotective properties, which has been shown to have positive effects in many neuropsychiatric disorders. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of riluzole as an adjunctive to risperidone in the treatment of irritability in autistic children who were not optimally responding to previous medications. This was a 10-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial. The study enrolled male and female outpatients aged 5-12\u00a0years with a diagnosis of autistic disorder based on the DSM-IV-TR criteria and a score of \u226512 on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) irritability subscale who had discontinued other medications because of a lack of efficacy. Subjects received riluzole (titrated to 50 or 100\u00a0mg\/day based on bodyweight) or placebo in addition to risperidone (titrated up to 2 or 3\u00a0mg\/day based on bodyweight) for 10\u00a0weeks. Patients were assessed at baseline, week 5, and week 10. The primary outcome measure was the difference in the change in the ABC-C irritability subscale score from baseline to week 10 between the two groups. We also compared changes in other ABC-C subscale scores and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale scores between the two groups. Forty-nine patients were enrolled in the study, and forty children completed the trial (dropouts: placebo\u00a0=\u00a04, riluzole\u00a0=\u00a05). A significantly greater improvement in the study primary outcome (the ABC-C irritability subscale score) was achieved by the riluzole-treated children compared with the placebo group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Patients in the riluzole group also showed significantly greater improvement on the lethargy\/social withdrawal (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02), stereotypic behavior (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03), and hyperactivity\/non-compliance subscales (P\u00a0=\u00a00.005), but not on the inappropriate speech subscale (P\u00a0=\u00a00.20) than patients in the placebo group. Eleven patients in the riluzole group and five patients in the placebo group were classified as responders based on their CGI-I scores [\u03c7(2)(1)\u00a0=\u00a03.750, P\u00a0=\u00a00.05]. Children in the riluzole group experienced significantly more increases in their appetite and bodyweight than children in the placebo group by the end of the study. Riluzole add-on therapy shows several therapeutic outcomes, particularly for improving irritability, in children with autism. However, its add-on to risperidone also results in significantly increased appetite and weight gain.","208":"<b><i>Objective:<\/i><\/b> To explore blinded observational outcomes in the Treatment of Severe Childhood Aggression (TOSCA) study. <b><i>Methods:<\/i><\/b> During a 9-week acute trial, children with severe physical aggression and attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder received parent training + titrated psychostimulant for 3 weeks, and those who failed to show an optimal response during Week 4 through Week 6 received in addition either randomly assigned placebo (Basic treatment) or titrated risperidone (Augmented treatment). Child and parent behaviors were videotaped in a Standardized Observation Analogue Procedure (SOAP) designed to elicit problems and strengths in child and parent interactions.

At follow-up, when medication was no longer by randomized assignment, parents used more Alpha Commands and displayed fewer Parent Negative Behaviors, and the dyads showed more Shared Enjoyment regardless of original randomization. Thus, there were better parent-child interactions with Augmented treatment, and interactions improved overall at follow-up regardless of original treatment assignment. <b><i>Conclusions:<\/i><\/b> The SOAP demonstrated sensitivity to behavior changes between short-term treatments for a few (but not most) measures. The acute treatment differences for Child Compliance and Child Negative Behavior are generally consistent with the moderate superiority of Augmented over Basic treatment previously reported for the primary study outcome.","209":"We examined the association of parent training (PT)-related factors with therapeutic success in the Treatment of Severe Childhood Aggression (TOSCA) study. Our aims were (1) to evaluate demographic and clinical characteristics as predictors of parent attendance and engagement in PT and (2) to examine the associations of parent attendance and engagement in PT with study-targeted child behavior outcomes (i.e., attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] and disruptive behavior symptoms). TOSCA was a randomized clinical trial evaluating the effect of placebo versus risperidone when added to PT and psychostimulant for childhood ADHD with severe aggression. Data for 167 parents and children 6-12 years old with ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) or conduct disorder, and severe physical aggression were examined. Analyses used generalized linear models. Most parents (72%) attended seven or more of nine sessions. The average parental engagement, that is, the percentage of PT elements fully achieved across participants and sessions, was 85%. The average therapist rating of goal completion was 92%. Parents of non-white and\/or Hispanic children (p\u2009=\u20090.01) and children with lower intelligence quotient (p\u2009=\u20090.02) had lower PT attendance; parents with lower family incomes (p\u2009=\u20090.01) were less engaged. Attendance and engagement predicted better scores on the primary child behavior outcomes of disruptive behavior (Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form Disruptive Behavior Total) and ADHD and ODD symptoms, adjusting for baseline severity. When the clinical picture is sufficiently severe to warrant prescribing an atypical antipsychotic, PT is feasible for families of children with ADHD and co-occurring severe aggression. The promotion of attendance and engagement in PT is important to enhance clinical outcomes among this challenging population. Methods for overcoming barriers to participation in PT deserve vigorous investigation, particularly for those with low family income, non-white race, Hispanic ethnicity, or when children have lower cognitive level.","210":"The Treatment of Severe Childhood Aggression (TOSCA) project examined augmentation of stimulant treatment and parent training (PT) with risperidone for severe physical aggression. This article summarizes the clinical implications; reanalyzes the data to examine the utility of 4 criteria for deciding to augment; and presents a treatment algorithm. The newly analyzed 4 criteria for augmenting after 3 weeks of stimulant and PT treatment consisted of not meeting a Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) score of 1 and a normal score (\u226415) on the Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form Disruptive-Total (D-Total); a CGI-I score of 1 or 2 plus 25% improvement in D-Total score; a D-Total score no higher than 15; and a CGI-Severity score of 3 (mild) or better. Effect sizes were calculated. Prior TOSCA publications were reviewed for clinically relevant findings. All 4 criteria resulted in medium or better effect sizes (d\u00a0= 0.59-0.72) when comparing risperidone with placebo. Providing risperidone to children who did not reach a CGI-I score of 1 plus a D-Total score no higher than 15 resulted in the greatest benefit. In addition, a review of clinically relevant data suggests that stimulant plus PT shows further improvement after 3 weeks even without augmentation. For those children who did not attain a CGI-I score of 1 and a D-total score no higher than 15, adding risperidone maximized the number of children benefitting from treatment and the average amount of benefit. Unless clinical circumstances dictate otherwise, practitioners should delay an antipsychotic drug for at least 1 month after the optimal stimulant dose is achieved and PT has commenced.

An important clinical question is whether these favorable outcomes are maintained over longer times. Clinical responders to the 9-week trial (n\u2009=\u2009103\/168), defined as Clinical Global Impressions (CGI)-Improvement of much\/very much improved plus substantial reduction in parent ratings of disruptiveness, were followed another 12 weeks (21 weeks total) while remaining on blinded treatment. Outcome measures included Clinical Global Impressions scale, Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form (NCBRF), other parent\/teacher-rated scales, laboratory tests, clinician ratings of abnormal movement, and other adverse events (AEs). Parent ratings of problem behavior showed minimal worsening of behavior from end of the 9-week acute trial (expected from regression to the mean after selecting best responders), but outcomes at Extension endpoint were meaningfully improved compared with acute study baseline. As expected, outcomes for Basic and Augmented treatment did not differ among these children selected for good clinical response. During Extension, more Augmented subjects had elevated prolactin; there were no clinically confirmed cases of tardive dyskinesia. Delayed sleep onset was the most frequent Basic AE. We also conducted a last-observation-carried-forward analysis, which included both nonresponders and responders. We found that, at the end of Extension, Augmented subjects had more improvement than Basic subjects on the NCBRF Positive Social subscale (p\u2009=\u20090.005; d\u2009=\u20090.44), the Antisocial Behavior Scale Reactive Aggression subscale (p\u2009=\u20090.03; d\u2009=\u20090.36), and marginally so on the Disruptive Behavior Total subscale (p\u2009=\u20090.058; d\u2009=\u20090.29, the primary outcome). The medium-term outcomes were good for the participants in both treatment groups, perhaps because they were selected for good response. When nonresponders were included in ITT analyses, there was some indication that Augmented surpassed Basic treatment.","212":"Risperidone is approved for the treatment of serious behavioral problems in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This study examined the effects of risperidone on cardiac conduction in children with ASD. Data were collected from an 8-week, five-site trial conducted by the Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology Autism Network. Children (age 5-17 years) were randomly assigned to risperidone (n\u2009=\u200949) or placebo (n\u2009=\u200952) under double-blind conditions. Risperidone was superior to placebo in reducing serious behavioral problems. A standard 12-lead, electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained in most subjects at screening and week 8. A pediatric electrophysiologist blind to treatment assignment reviewed all available ECGs for readability, abnormalities, and cardiac conduction parameters, including QTc. The electrophysiologist measurements were compared to machine readings. A second blinded electrophysiologist examined all available ECGs for abnormalities and a 20% random sample for QTc. Of the 101 randomized subjects in the trial, complete pretreatment and week 8 data were available on 65 subjects (placebo n\u2009=\u200930; risperidone n\u2009=\u200935). The electrophysiologist did not identify any cardiac conduction adverse effects of risperidone and there was no difference in mean change on the QTc compared to placebo. The Bland-Altman plot showed a systematic bias in QTc measurements by the electrophysiologist and machine. Machine readings produced higher values than the electrophysiologist for shorter QTc intervals and machine scoring was lower than electrophysiologist readings for longer QTc values (p\u2009=\u20090.001). Two electrophysiologists had overall percent agreements of 82.9% (95% CI: 76.3 to 89.6) on qualitative assessment and 88.6% (95% CI: 79.3 to 98.0) on QTc interval. Using conventional doses during acute treatment in children with ASD and serious behavioral problems, there was no difference in the mean change in QTc between risperidone and placebo. Compared to the electrophysiologist, the machine readings may miss elevated QTc measurements.","213":"Professionals have periodically expressed concern that atypical antipsychotics may cause cognitive blunting in treated patients. In this study, we report data from a double-blind, randomized, controlled study of stimulant plus placebo versus combined stimulant and risperidone to evaluate the effects of the atypical antipsychotic on attention and short-term memory. A total of 165 (n\u2009=\u200983 combined treatment; n\u2009=\u200982 stimulant plus placebo) children with attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder and severe physical aggression, aged 6-12 years, were evaluated with Conners' Continuous Performance Test (CPT-II) and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III (WISC) Digit Span subscale at baseline, after 3 weeks of stimulant-only treatment, and after six additional weeks of randomized treatment (stimulant+placebo vs. stimulant+risperidone). At 3 weeks, improvement on CPT-II performance (Commissions and Reaction Time Standard Error; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and on Digit Span memory performance (p\u2009<\u20090.006) was noted for the full sample. At study week 9, no difference in CPT-II or Digit Span performance was observed between the randomized groups (ps\u2009=\u20090.41 to 0.83). Similar to other studies, we found no deleterious effects on attention and short-term memory associated with short-term use of risperidone.

Almost two-thirds (n\u00a0= 108; 64%) of families in the 9-week study participated in week 52 follow-ups (Basic, n\u00a0= 55; Augmented, n\u00a0= 53) and were representative of the initial study sample. The assessment battery included caregiver and clinician ratings and laboratory tests. Only 43% of participants in the Augmented group and 36% in the Basic group still adhered to their assigned regimen (not significant [NS]); 23% of those in the Augmented group and 11% in the Basic group were taking no medication (NS). Both randomized groups improved baseline to follow-up, but the 3 primary parent-reported behavioral outcomes showed no significant between-group differences. Exploratory analyses indicated that participants in the Augmented group (65%) were more likely (p\u00a0= .02) to have a Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) severity score of 1 to 3 (i.e., normal to mildly ill) at follow-up than those in the Basic group (42%). Parents rated 45% of children as impaired often or very often from ADHD, noncompliant, or aggressive behavior. The Augmented group had elevated prolactin levels, and the Basic group had decreased weight over time. Findings were generally similar whether groups were defined by randomized assignment or follow-up treatment status. Both treatment strategies were associated with clinical improvement at follow-up, and primary behavioral outcomes did not differ significantly.

We monitored height, weight, waist circumference, and adverse effects during the trial. Fasting blood samples were obtained before treatment and at week\u00a016. In 97 children with a mean of 22.9 \u00b1 2.8 weeks of risperidone exposure, there was a 5.4 \u00b1 3.4 kg weight gain over 24 weeks (p\u00a0< .0001); waist circumference increased from 60.7 \u00b1 10.4 cm to 66.8 \u00b1 11.3 cm (p\u00a0< .0001). At baseline, 59 of 97 children (60.8%) were classified as having normal weight; by week 24, only 25 of 85 (29.4%) remained in that group. Growth curve analysis showed a significant change in body mass index (BMI) z scores from pretreatment to week 24 (p\u00a0< .0001). This effect was significantly greater for children with reported increased appetite in the first 8 weeks. From before treatment to week 16, there were significant increases in glucose (p\u00a0=\u00a0.02), hemoglobin A1c (p\u00a0= .01), insulin (p\u00a0<.0001), homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; p\u00a0< .001), alanine aminotransferase (p\u00a0= .01), and leptin (p\u00a0< .0001). Adiponectin declined (p\u00a0= .003). At baseline, 7 children met conventional criteria for metabolic syndrome; by week 16, 12 additional children were so classified. Rapid weight gain with risperidone treatment may promote the cascade of biochemical indices associated with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.

Less is known about the long-term effects of risperidone exposure in this population. We examined the tolerability, safety, and therapeutic benefit of risperidone exposure over a 1-2 year follow-up period. In a naturalistic study, 84 children and adolescents 5-17 years of age (from an original sample of 101) were assessed an average of 21.4 months after initial entry into a placebo-controlled 8 week trial of risperidone for children and adolescents with autism and severe irritability. They were assessed at baseline and at follow-up on safety and tolerability measures (blood, urinalysis, electrocardiogram [ECG], medical history, vital signs, neurological symptoms, other adverse events), developmental measures (adaptive behavior, intelligence quotient [IQ]), and standardized rating instruments. Treatment over the follow-up period, after completion of protocol participation, was uncontrolled. Statistical analyses assessed outcome over time with or without prolonged risperidone therapy. Two-thirds of the 84 subjects continued to receive risperidone (mean 2.47\u2009mg\/day, S.D. 1.29\u2009mg). At follow-up, risperidone was associated with more enuresis, more excessive appetite, and more weight gain, but not more adverse neurological effects. No clinically significant events were noted on blood counts, chemistries, urinalysis, ECG, or interim medical history. Regardless of drug condition at follow-up, there was considerable improvement in maladaptive behavior compared with baseline, including core symptoms associated with autism. Height and weight gains were elevated with risperidone. Social skills on Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS) improved with risperidone. Parent-rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) Irritability subscale scores were reduced in those taking risperidone at follow-up. Several other measures of maladaptive behavior (some related to socialization) also showed improved functioning in association with risperidone on the ABC or on the Modified Real Life Rating Scale. Increased appetite, weight gain, and enuresis are risks associated with long-term risperidone. Our data suggest that these risks were balanced by longer-term behavioral and social benefits for many children over 1.8 years of ongoing treatment.","217":"The purpose of this study was to examine the satisfaction of families who participated in the Treatment of Severe Childhood Aggression (TOSCA) study. TOSCA was a randomized clinical trial of psychostimulant plus parent training plus placebo (basic treatment) versus psychostimulant plus parent training plus risperidone (augmented treatment) for children with severe physical aggression, disruptive behavior disorder, and attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder. Parents completed a standardized Parent Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ). Of the 168 families randomized, 150 (89.3%) provided consumer satisfaction data. When they were asked if they would join the study again if they had the option to repeat, 136 (91%) said \"yes,\" 11 (7%) said \"maybe,\" and one (<1%) said \"no.\" When asked if they would recommend the study to other parents with children having similar problems, 147 (98%) said \"yes\" and 3 (2%) said \"maybe.\" Between 71% (rating one aspect of the Parent Training) and 96% (regarding the diagnostic interview) endorsed study procedures using the most positive response option. Asked if there were certain aspects of the study that they especially liked, 64 (43%) spontaneously reported parent training. Treatment assignment (basic vs. augmented) and responder status were not associated with reported satisfaction. However, responder status was strongly associated with parent confidence in managing present (p<0.001) and future (p<0.005) problem behaviors. These findings indicate high levels of satisfaction with TOSCA study involvement and, taken together with previous pediatric psychopharmacology social validity studies, suggest high levels of support for the research experience.

In this 6 month (26 week) open-label extension (OLE) study, patients (5-17 years of age, who completed the previous fixed-dose, 6 week, double-blind [DB] phase) were flexibly dosed with risperidone based on body weight. The maximum allowed dose was 1.25 mg\/day for those weighing 20 to <45 kg, and 1.75 mg\/day for those weighing \u2265 45 kg. The study primarily assessed risperidone's safety; efficacy was assessed as a secondary end-point. Fifty-six (71%) out of 79 enrolled patients completed the OLE; the most common discontinuations were for insufficient response (7 [9%]) or adverse events (AE) (5 [6%]). The most common (\u2265 5% frequency in the total group) AEs were increased appetite (11% [n=9]); increased weight and vomiting (9% [n=7] each); sedation, pyrexia, and upper respiratory tract infection (8% [n=6] each); nasopharyngitis (6% [n=5]); and somnolence and fatigue (5% [n=4] each). Extrapyramidal AEs were reported in 6 (8%) patients. Increase in mean weight (11-15%) and body mass index (5-10%) occurred; one patient discontinued because of weight increase. One potentially prolactin-related AE (irregular menstruation) was reported. The risperidone high-dose group had the greatest mean improvement in sleep visual analog scale (24.6). All groups showed additional improvement in efficacy scale scores during the OLE. During this OLE, safety findings with risperidone treatment (maximum weight-based dose of 1.25 mg\/day or 1.75 mg\/day) were consistent with those observed in the DB phase, and with the current safety information for risperidone in autistic, psychiatric, and behavioral disorders. Patients experienced some additional improvement in irritability and related behaviors. This phase-4 study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00576732).","219":"Efficacy and safety of 2 risperidone doses were evaluated in children and adolescents with autism. Patients (N\u00a0=\u00a096; 5-17\u00a0years), received risperidone (low-dose: 0.125\u00a0mg\/day [20 to <45\u00a0kg], 0.175\u00a0mg\/day [>45\u00a0kg] or high-dose: 1.25\u00a0mg\/day [20 to <45\u00a0kg], 1.75\u00a0mg\/day [>45\u00a0kg]) or placebo. Mean baseline (range 27-29) to endpoint change in Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability (primary endpoint) was significantly greater in the high-dose-(-12.4 [6.5]; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), but not low-dose (-7.4 [8.1]; p\u00a0=\u00a00.164) group, versus placebo (-3.5 [10.7]). Clinical Global Impressions-Severity and Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale scores improved significantly only in the high-dose group, consistent with ABC-I results. Somnolence, sedation and increased appetite occurred more frequently in high-versus low-dose groups. Overall, increased appetite occurred most frequently.","220":"Repetitive behavior is a core feature of autism spectrum disorder. We used 8-week data from two federally funded, multi-site, randomized trials with risperidone conducted by the Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology Autism Network to evaluate the sensitivity of the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for autism spectrum disorder to detect change with treatment. Study 1 included 52 subjects assigned to placebo and 49 subjects to risperidone under double-blind conditions. In Study 2, 49 subjects received risperidone only and 75 subjects received risperidone plus parent training. The combined sample consisted of 187 boys and 38 girls (aged 4-17 years). At the medication-free baseline, the internal consistency on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for autism spectrum disorder total score was excellent (Cronbach's alpha = 0.84) and the mean scores were similar across the four groups. Compared to placebo in Study 1, all three active treatment groups showed significant improvement (effect sizes: 0.74-0.88). There were no differences between active treatment groups. These results indicate that the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for autism spectrum disorder has acceptable test-retest as evidenced by the medium to high correlations in the placebo group and demonstrated sensitivity to change with treatment.","221":"This study identified subtypes of aggression in a sample of 206 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who participated in 2 risperidone trials. The narratives were derived from a parent interview about each child's 2 most pressing problems. Five subtypes of aggression emerged: hot aggression only, cold aggression only, self-injurious behavior (SIB) only, aggression and SIB, and nonaggressive. All groups showed a high rate of positive response to risperidone with no differences across subtypes. These study findings extend understanding of aggression in ASD and may be useful to guide further study on biological mechanisms and individualized treatment in ASD.","222":"There is growing interest in measuring social disability as a core element of autism spectrum disorders in medication trials. We conducted a secondary analysis on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Social Withdrawal subscale using data from two federally-funded, multi-site, randomized trials with risperidone. Study 1 included 52 subjects assigned to placebo and 49 subjects to risperidone under double-blind conditions. Study 2 included 49 subjects assigned to risperidone only and 75 subjects assigned to risperidone plus parent training. After 8 weeks of treatment, all active treatments were superior to placebo (effect sizes ranging from 0.42 to 0.65). The findings suggest that the Social Withdrawal subscale may be a useful measure of social disability in acute treatment trials.","223":"Risperidone has been shown to improve serious behavioral problems in children with autism. Here we asked whether risperidone-associated improvement was related to changes in concentrations of inflammatory molecules in the serum of these subjects. Seven molecules were identified as worthy of further assessment by performing a pilot analysis of 31 inflammatory markers in 21 medication-free subjects with autism versus 15 healthy controls: epidermal growth factor (EGF), interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), interleukin (IL)-13, IL-17, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), IL-1 and IL-1-receptor antagonist. Serum concentrations of these markers were then established in a different set of subjects that participated in a double-blind, clinical trial and an expanded group of healthy subjects. In the first analysis, samples obtained from subjects with autism at baseline visits were compared to visits after 8-week treatment with placebo (n=37) or risperidone (n=40). The cytokine concentrations remained stable over the 8-week period for both risperidone and placebo groups. In the second analysis, we explored further the differences between medication-free subjects with autism (n=77) and healthy controls (recruited independently; n=19). Serum levels of EGF were elevated in subjects with autism (median=103 pg\/mL, n=75) in comparison to healthy controls (75 pg\/mL, n=19; p<0.05), and levels of IL-13 were decreased in autism (median=0.8 pg\/mL, n=77) in comparison to controls (9.8 pg\/mL, n=19; p=0.0003). These changes did not correlate with standardized measures used for a diagnosis of autism. In summary, risperidone-induced clinical improvement in subjects with autism was not associated with changes in the serum inflammatory markers measured. Whether altered levels of EGF and IL-13 play a role in the pathogenesis or phenotype of autism requires further investigation.","224":"This paper presents the rationale for a 24-week, randomized trial designed to test whether risperidone plus structured parent training would be superior to risperidone only on measures of noncompliance, irritability and adaptive functioning. In this model, medication reduces tantrums, aggression and self-injury; parent training promotes improvement in noncompliance and adaptive functioning. Thus, medication and parent training target related, but separate, outcomes. At week 24, the medication was gradually withdrawn to determine whether subjects in the combined treatment group could be managed on a lower dose or off medication without relapse. Both symptom reduction and functional improvement are important clinical treatment targets. Thus, experimental evidence on the beneficial effects of combining pharmacotherapy and exportable behavioral interventions is needed to guide clinical practice.","225":"The objective of this research was to explore the effects of risperidone on cognitive processes in children with autism and irritable behavior. Thirty-eight children, ages 5-17 years with autism and severe behavioral disturbance, were randomly assigned to risperidone (0.5 to 3.5 mg\/day) or placebo for 8 weeks. This sample of 38 was a subset of 101 subjects who participated in the clinical trial; 63 were unable to perform the cognitive tasks. A double-blind placebo-controlled parallel groups design was used. Dependent measures included tests of sustained attention, verbal learning, hand-eye coordination, and spatial memory assessed before, during, and after the 8-week treatment. Changes in performance were compared by repeated measures ANOVA. Twenty-nine boys and 9 girls with autism and severe behavioral disturbance and a mental age >or=18 months completed the cognitive part of the study. No decline in performance occurred with risperidone. Performance on a cancellation task (number of correct detections) and a verbal learning task (word recognition) was better on risperidone than on placebo (without correction for multiplicity). Equivocal improvement also occurred on a spatial memory task. There were no significant differences between treatment conditions on the Purdue Pegboard (hand-eye coordination) task or the Analog Classroom Task (timed math test). Risperidone given to children with autism at doses up to 3.5 mg for up to 8 weeks appears to have no detrimental effect on cognitive performance.","226":"Risperidone may be effective in improving tantrums, aggression, or self-injurious behaviour in children with autism, but often leads to weight gain. Using a quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), we prospectively examined the nutritional intake of 20 children with autism participating in a randomised placebo-controlled trial of risperidone for disruptive behaviours. At baseline, the mean intakes for macronutrients, vitamins and minerals exceeded Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs). However there was substantial inter-participant variability, with individual deficiencies (<80% of DRI) in the intake of calcium (9 of 20 participants), pantothenic acid (6 of 20), vitamin D (5 of 20) and vitamin K (8 of 20). For the participants for whom FFQs were available, there was an increase in weight and an increase in vitamin K intake after 2 months of risperidone treatment (n = 9) compared to placebo (n = 8). An additional 4 months of risperidone treatment (n = 8) did not result in significant changes in reported nutritional balance. These pilot data suggest that treatment with risperidone did not significantly affect the nutritional balance of this small group of children.","227":"The brain serotonin level is decreased in individuals with autism. Buspirone is a 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist with antiaggressive effects increasing prosocial behaviors. We conducted an 8-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial. Participants included 40 outpatient children and adolescents with autism. The patients took buspirone plus risperidone or risperidone plus placebo during 8 weeks. The patients were assessed at baseline, week 4, and week 8 using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Rating Scale. Eighteen patients in the placebo group and 16 patients in the buspirone group completed this trial. The mean dose of buspirone was 6.7 (SD 2.7) mg\/day. Irritability subscale score significantly decreased during this trial in both groups (buspirone group: declined from 25.7 [SD 5.7] to 16.3 [SD 8.5]; placebo group: declined from 24.7 [SD 7.6] to 18.2 [SD 7.7]). The Cohen d effect size was .45. Thirteen (81.2%) of 16 patients in the buspirone group and 7 (38.9%) of 18 patients in the placebo group showed a \u226530% decline in irritability score. The relative risk for treatment was 2.1. There were no serious adverse effects. The most common adverse effects in the buspirone group were increased appetite, drowsiness, and fatigue. This clinical trial supports that low dose buspirone plus risperidone is more effective than risperidone plus placebo for treating irritability in individuals with autism.","228":"This study examined the efficacy and safety of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) augmentation for treating irritability in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Forty children and adolescents met diagnostic criteria for ASD according to DSM-IV. They were randomly allocated into one of the two groups of NAC (1200\u2009mg\/day)+risperidone or placebo+risperidone. NAC and placebo were administered in the form of effervescent and in two divided doses for 8 weeks. Irritability subscale score of Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) was considered as the main outcome measure. Adverse effects were also checked. The mean score of irritability in the NAC+risperidone and placebo+risperidone groups at baseline was 13.2(5.3) and 16.7(7.8), respectively. The scores after 8 weeks were 9.7(4.1) and 15.1(7.8), respectively. Repeated measures of ANOVA showed that there was a significant difference between the two groups after 8 weeks. The most common adverse effects in the NAC+risperidone group were constipation (16.1%), increased appetite (16.1%), fatigue (12.9%), nervousness (12.9%), and daytime drowsiness (12.9%). There was no fatal adverse effect. Risperidone plus NAC more than risperidone plus placebo decreased irritability in children and adolescents with ASD. Meanwhile, it did not change the core symptoms of autism. Adverse effects were not common and NAC was generally tolerated well. This trial was registered at http:\/\/www.irct.ir. The registration number of this trial was IRCT201106103930N6.","229":"According to the proposed interference of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) with pathophysiologic processes of autistic disorders (ADs), we aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of NAC as an adjunct to risperidone in the treatment of ADs in a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial. The participants were referred outpatients between 4 and 12 years of age with the diagnosis of ADs and a score of more than 12 on Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) Irritability subscale score. The participants were randomized into 2 groups. One group received risperidone plus NAC, and the other group received risperidone plus placebo. The dose of risperidone was titrated between 1 and 2.0 mg\/d, and the dose of NAC was 600 to 900 mg\/d. The main outcome was mean decrease in the ABC-C irritability subscale score from baseline at 5 and 10 weeks. Changes in other subscales were considered as secondary outcome measures. Forty patients completed the 10-week trial. Baseline characteristics including age, sex and body weight, as well as baseline scores in 5 subscales did not demonstrate statistically significant difference between the 2 groups. Repeated-measures analysis showed significant effect for time \u00d7 treatment interaction in irritability (P = 0.01) and hyperactivity\/noncompliance (P = 0.02) subscales. By week 10, the NAC group showed significantly more reduction in irritability (P = 0.02) and hyperactivity\/noncompliance (P = 0.01) subscales scores. N-acetylcysteine can be considered as an adjuvant therapy for ADs with beneficial therapeutic outcomes.","230":"Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that forms part of a spectrum of related disorders referred to as Autism Spectrum Disorders. The present study assessed the effects of topiramate plus risperidone in the treatment of autistic disorder. Forty children between the ages of 4 and 12 years with a DSM IV clinical diagnosis of autism who were outpatients from a specialty clinic for children were recruited. The children presented with a chief complaint of severely disruptive symptoms related to autistic disorder. Patients were randomly allocated to topiramate+risperidone (Group A) or placebo+risperidone (Group B) for an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The dose of risperidone was titrated up to 2 mg\/day for children between 10 and 40 kg and 3 mg\/day for children weighting above 40 kg. The dose of topiramate was titrated up to 200 mg\/day depending on weight (100 mg\/day for <30 kg and 200 mg\/day for >30 kg). Patients were assessed at baseline and after 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after starting medication. Measure of outcome was the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) Rating Scale. Difference between the two protocols was significant as the group that received topiramate had a greater reduction in ABC-C subscale scores for irritability, stereotypic behavior and hyperactivity\/noncompliance. The results suggest that the combination of topiramate with risperidone may be superior to risperidone monotherapy for children with autistic disorder. However the results need to be further confirmed by a larger randomized controlled trial.","231":"The aim of the study was to compare safety, efficacy and tolerability of risperidone with haloperidol in the treatment of Autistic Disorder (AD). This study was designed as a double-blind, prospective, for a 12-week period. A total of 30 subjects, between the ages of 8 and 18 with AD based on DSM IV criteria, were included in the study. Behavioral Rating Scales were performed by the investigators and the parents. Safety assessment included vital signs, electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram, adverse events, laboratory tests, extrapyramidal symptoms and the side effects. Both treatments were applied in a once daily dosage regimen of 0.01-0.08 mg\/kg\/day. The reduction from baseline in Ritvo-Freeman Real Life Rating Scale (RF-RLRS), sensory motor (subscale I) and language (subscale V) scores were significant in risperidone group (P < 0.05). Compared to haloperidol, risperidone led to a significantly greater reduction in the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and Turgay DSM-IV Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) scale scores (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). There was a greater increase of prolactin in the risperidone group, while alanine amino transferase (ALT) had further increased in the haloperidol group. Sensory motor behaviors (subscale I) and language at the end of the 12th week, RF-RLRS sensory motor and language subscale scores decreased in the risperidone group further than the other group (P < 0.05). Risperidone was found to be more effective than haloperidol in the treatment of behavioral symptoms, impulsivity, language skills, and impaired social relations in children with AD. These results demonstrated that both drugs were safe and well tolerated in the treatment of AD.","232":"Sulforaphane (SF), an isothiocyanate in broccoli, has potential benefits relevant to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through its effects on several metabolic and immunologic pathways. Previous clinical trials of oral SF demonstrated positive clinical effects on behavior in young men and changes in urinary metabolomics in children with ASD. We conducted a 15-week randomized parallel double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial with 15-week open-label treatment and 6-week no-treatment extensions in 57 children, ages 3-12\u00a0years, with ASD over 36\u00a0weeks. Twenty-eight were assigned SF and 29 received placebo (PL). Clinical effects, safety and tolerability of SF were measured as were biomarkers to elucidate mechanisms of action of SF in ASD. Data from 22 children taking SF and 23 on PL were analyzed. Treatment effects on the primary outcome measure, the Ohio Autism Clinical Impressions Scale (OACIS), in the general level of autism were not significant between SF and PL groups at 7 and 15\u00a0weeks. The effect sizes on the OACIS were non-statistically significant but positive, suggesting a possible trend toward greater improvement in those on treatment with SF (Cohen's d 0.21; 95% CI -\u20090.46, 0.88 and 0.10; 95% CI -\u20090.52, 0.72, respectively). Both groups improved in all subscales when on SF during the open-label phase. Caregiver ratings on secondary outcome measures improved significantly on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) at 15\u00a0weeks (Cohen's d -\u20090.96; 95% CI -\u20091.73, -\u20090.15), but not on the Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2). Ratings on the ABC and SRS-2 improved with a non-randomized analysis of the length of exposure to SF, compared to the pre-treatment baseline (p\u2009<\u20090.001). There were significant changes with SF compared to PL in biomarkers of glutathione redox status, mitochondrial respiration, inflammatory markers and heat shock proteins. Clinical laboratory studies confirmed product safety. SF was very well tolerated and side effects of treatment, none serious, included rare insomnia, irritability and intolerance of the taste and smell. The sample size was limited to 45 children with ASD and we did not impute missing data. We were unable to document significant changes in clinical assessments during clinical visits in those taking SF compared to PL. The clinical results were confounded by placebo effects during the open-label phase. SF led to small yet non-statistically significant changes in the total and all subscale scores of the primary outcome measure, while for secondary outcome measures, caregivers' assessments of children taking SF showed statistically significant improvements compared to those taking PL on the ABC but not the SRS-2. Clinical effects of SF were less notable in children compared to our previous trial of a SF-rich preparation in young men with ASD. Several of the effects of SF on biomarkers correlated to clinical improvements. SF was very well tolerated and safe and effective based on our secondary clinical measures. This study was prospectively registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02561481) on September 28, 2015. Funding was provided by the U.S. Department of Defense.","233":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), characterized by both impaired communication and social interaction, and by stereotypic behavior, affects about 1 in 68, predominantly males. The medico-economic burdens of ASD are enormous, and no recognized treatment targets the core features of ASD. In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial, young men (aged 13-27) with moderate to severe ASD received the phytochemical sulforaphane (n = 29)--derived from broccoli sprout extracts--or indistinguishable placebo (n = 15). The effects on behavior of daily oral doses of sulforaphane (50-150 \u00b5mol) for 18 wk, followed by 4 wk without treatment, were quantified by three widely accepted behavioral measures completed by parents\/caregivers and physicians: the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), and Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale (CGI-I). Initial scores for ABC and SRS were closely matched for participants assigned to placebo and sulforaphane. After 18 wk, participants receiving placebo experienced minimal change (<3.3%), whereas those receiving sulforaphane showed substantial declines (improvement of behavior): 34% for ABC (P < 0.001, comparing treatments) and 17% for SRS scores (P = 0.017). On CGI-I, a significantly greater number of participants receiving sulforaphane had improvement in social interaction, abnormal behavior, and verbal communication (P = 0.015-0.007). Upon discontinuation of sulforaphane, total scores on all scales rose toward pretreatment levels. Dietary sulforaphane, of recognized low toxicity, was selected for its capacity to reverse abnormalities that have been associated with ASD, including oxidative stress and lower antioxidant capacity, depressed glutathione synthesis, reduced mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation, increased lipid peroxidation, and neuroinflammmation.","234":"The purpose of this study was to determine if tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) reduced core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this study, 46 children, 3-7 years of age diagnosed with an ASD were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with 20\u2009mg\/kg\/day BH4 or placebo for 16 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement and Severity Scales (CGI-I and CGI-S); secondary outcomes were the Preschool Language Scale-4 (PLS-4), Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (Vineland). Overall, no differences were found on global improvement as measured with the CGI-I or CGI-S. Secondary measures indicated significant improvements for BH4 relative to placebo with regard to social awareness, autism mannerisms, hyperactivity, and inappropriate speech. Side effects were minimal and similar between both active medication and placebo. These results indicate that BH4 offers promise in reducing symptoms of ASD. Clinical Trials.gov Identifier: NCT00850070.","235":"To date, no medication has been approved as an effective treatment for methamphetamine dependence. Topiramate has attracted considerable attention as a treatment for the dependence on alcohol and stimulants. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of topiramate for methamphetamine dependence. This study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. In the present investigation, 62 methamphetamine-dependent adults were enrolled and randomized into two groups, and received topiramate or a placebo for 10 weeks in escalating doses from 50 mg\/day to the target maintenance dose of 200 mg\/day. Addiction severity index (ASI) and craving scores were registered every week. The Beck questionnaire was also given to each participant at baseline and every 2 weeks during the treatment. Urine samples were collected at baseline and every 2 weeks during the treatment. Fifty-seven patients completed 10 weeks of the trial. There was no significant difference between both groups in the mean percentage of prescribed capsules taken by the participants. At week six, the topiramate group showed a significantly lower proportion of methamphetamine-positive urine tests in comparison with the placebo group (P = 0.01). In addition, there were significantly lower scores in the topiramate group in comparison with the placebo group in two domains of ASI: drug use severity (P < 0.001) and drug need (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the craving score (duration) significantly declined in the topiramate patients compared to those receiving the placebo. In conclusion, the results of this trial suggest that topiramate may be beneficial for the treatment of methamphetamine dependence.","236":"The present study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of low-dose topiramate and compare it with sodium valproate that is prevalently prescribed as a migraine prophylaxis. This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial on 56 patients who completed the course of study. Topiramate and valproate were administered at 50 mg\/day and 400 mg\/day, respectively, during the follow-up period. Frequency, intensity, duration, associated symptoms with headaches, analgesics use, as well as drugs' side effects were studied. Participants completed MIDAS and HIT-6 questionnaires before and after treatment. Frequency, intensity, and duration of migraine headaches as well as MIDAS score and symptomatic medications decreased significantly between repeated follow-up visits in both groups. Responder rate for patients treated with topiramate and valproate were 71.6% and 64.3%, respectively, and the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. The reduction of headache severity in the topiramate group was significantly more than that in the valproate group (p = .027). During the study, no statistically significant reduction in associated symptoms with migraine were observed in both the groups. Topiramate dose of 50 mg\/day with fewer side effects in comparison with its higher doses may be an appropriate substitution for first-line migraine prophylaxis such as valproate.","237":"Trofinetide was approved for the treatment of Rett syndrome based on the results of the phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, 12-week LAVENDER study. Rett syndrome is a chronic disorder requiring long-term treatment. We report the efficacy and safety results of LILAC, a 40-week, open-label extension study of LAVENDER. Females with Rett syndrome aged 5-21 years received open-label treatment with trofinetide for 40\u00a0weeks. The primary endpoint was long-term safety of trofinetide; secondary endpoints included the change from baseline at week 40 in the Rett Syndrome Behaviour Questionnaire score and the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement score at week 40. Overall, 154 participants were enrolled and treated with trofinetide in LILAC. The most common adverse events in LILAC were diarrhea (74.7%), vomiting (28.6%), and COVID-19 (11.0%). Diarrhea was\u00a0the most common adverse event leading to treatment withdrawal (21.4%). The Rett Syndrome Behaviour Questionnaire mean score (standard error) improvement from the LAVENDER baseline to week 40 in LILAC was -7.3 (1.62) and -7.0 (1.61) for participants treated with trofinetide and placebo in LAVENDER, respectively. Mean Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scores (standard error) at week 40 rated from the LILAC baseline were 3.1 (0.11) and 3.2 (0.14) for participants treated with trofinetide and placebo in LAVENDER, respectively. Treatment with trofinetide for \u226440\u00a0weeks continued to improve symptoms of Rett syndrome. Trofinetide had a similar safety profile in LILAC as in LAVENDER. The study was supported by Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. (San Diego, CA, USA). This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04279314).","238":"Trofinetide was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Rett syndrome (RTT) in March 2023. Benefiting the ability to communicate in RTT is often identified as the most important caregiver goal for new therapies. This analysis reports the communication-related end points from the phase 3 LAVENDER study of trofinetide in RTT. Females with RTT, aged five to 20\u00a0years, were randomized 1:1 to trofinetide or placebo for 12\u00a0weeks. Secondary efficacy end points related to communication were based on change from baseline to week 12 and included the caregiver-rated Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales Developmental Profile\u2122 Infant-Toddler Checklist (CSBS-DP-IT) Social Composite score (key secondary end point; scores ranged from 0 to 26 [higher scores indicated better communication]) and novel clinician rating scales (0 [normal] to 7 [severe impairment]) measuring the ability to communicate choices nonverbally (RTT-COMC) and verbally (RTT-VCOM). Trofinetide demonstrated a statistically significant difference versus placebo for the CSBS-DP-IT Social Composite score (least squares mean [LSM] difference\u00a0=\u00a01.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.3 to 1.7; P\u00a0=\u00a00.0064; Cohen's d effect size\u00a0=\u00a00.43) and a nominally significant difference for the RTT-COMC (LSM difference:\u00a0-0.3; 95% CI,\u00a0-0.6 to\u00a0-0.0; P\u00a0=\u00a00.0257; Cohen's d effect size\u00a0=\u00a00.36). As expected, there was no difference for the RTT-VCOM. Significant treatment benefit for trofinetide versus placebo was observed in scales measuring the ability to communicate. These scales may be appropriate for future clinical studies in RTT and other neurodevelopmental disorders.","239":"Rett syndrome is a rare, genetic neurodevelopmental disorder. Trofinetide is a synthetic analog of glycine-proline-glutamate, the N-terminal tripeptide of the insulin-like growth factor 1 protein, and has demonstrated clinical benefit in phase 2 studies in Rett syndrome. In this phase 3 study ( https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT04181723 ), females with Rett syndrome received twice-daily oral trofinetide (n\u2009=\u200993) or placebo (n\u2009=\u200994) for 12 weeks. For the coprimary efficacy endpoints, least squares mean (LSM) change from baseline to week 12 in the Rett Syndrome Behaviour Questionnaire for trofinetide versus placebo was -4.9 versus -1.7 (P\u2009=\u20090.0175; Cohen's d effect size, 0.37), and LSM Clinical Global Impression-Improvement at week 12 was 3.5 versus 3.8 (P\u2009=\u20090.0030; effect size, 0.47). For the key secondary efficacy endpoint, LSM change from baseline to week 12 in the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales Developmental Profile Infant-Toddler Checklist Social Composite score was -0.1 versus -1.1 (P\u2009=\u20090.0064; effect size, 0.43). Common treatment-emergent adverse events included diarrhea (80.6% for trofinetide versus 19.1% for placebo), which was mostly mild to moderate in severity. Significant improvement for trofinetide compared with placebo was observed for the coprimary efficacy endpoints, suggesting that trofinetide provides benefit in treating the core symptoms of Rett syndrome.","240":"Rett syndrome (RTT) is a debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder with no approved treatments.

In a phase 2, placebo-controlled trial in 82 females with RTT aged 5-15\u00a0years, a significant (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.042) improvement over placebo was observed with the highest trofinetide dose (200\u00a0mg\/kg twice daily [BID]) on three measures: Rett Syndrome Behaviour Questionnaire (RSBQ), Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I), and RTT-Clinician Domain Specific Concerns-Visual Analog Scale (RTT-DSC-VAS). Trofinetide was well tolerated at all doses (50, 100, and 200\u00a0mg\/kg BID). A phase 3 trial utilizing disease-specific and novel scales was designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of trofinetide in girls and women with RTT. This 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study (LAVENDER; NCT04181723) will evaluate trofinetide in 187 females, aged 5-20\u00a0years, with RTT. Co-primary endpoints are the RSBQ and CGI-I scales. Clinical domains of the CGI-I include communication, ambulation, hand use, seizures, attentiveness, and social (eye contact) and autonomic (breathing) aspects. Secondary endpoints will leverage four novel RTT-specific clinician ratings (derived from the RTT-DSC-VAS) of hand function, ambulation, ability to communicate, and verbal communication, and existing scales, to evaluate other core symptoms of RTT, quality of life and caregiver burden. A 40-week, open-label extension study will follow. This study was designed using disease-specific scales optimized to demonstrate changes in core symptoms of RTT and may provide the first phase 3 data demonstrating drug efficacy in individuals with RTT.

This study was an exploratory, phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study of the safety and tolerability of orally administered trofinetide in 72 adolescent and adult males with fragile X syndrome. Subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 35 or 70\u00a0mg\/kg twice daily trofinetide or placebo for 28\u00a0days. Safety assessments included adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms, physical examinations, and concomitant medications. Efficacy measurements were categorized into four efficacy domains, which related to clinically relevant phenotypic dimensions of impairment associated with fragile X syndrome. Both 35 and 70\u00a0mg\/kg dose levels of trofinetide were well tolerated and appeared to be generally safe. Trofinetide at the 70\u00a0mg\/kg dose level demonstrated efficacy compared with placebo based on prespecified criteria. On the basis of a permutation test, the probability of a false-positive outcome for the achieved prespecified success was 0.045. In the group analysis, improvement from treatment baseline was demonstrated on three fragile X syndrome-specific outcome measures. Trofinetide was well tolerated in adolescent and adult males with fragile X syndrome. Despite the relatively short duration of the study, a consistent signal of efficacy at the higher dose was observed in both caregiver and clinician assessments, based on a novel analytical model incorporating evaluation of multiple key symptom areas of fragile X syndrome. This finding suggests a potential for trofinetide treatment to provide clinically meaningful improvement in core fragile X syndrome symptoms.","242":"To determine safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of trofinetide and evaluate its efficacy in female children\/adolescents with Rett syndrome (RTT), a debilitating neurodevelopmental condition for which no pharmacotherapies directed at core features are available. This was a phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, in which safety\/tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and clinical response to trofinetide were characterized in 82 children\/adolescents with RTT, aged 5 to 15 years. Sixty-two participants were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive placebo twice a day (bid) for 14 days, followed by placebo, 50, 100, or 200 mg\/kg bid of trofinetide for 42 days. Following blinded safety data review, 20 additional participants were randomized 1:1 to the 200 mg\/kg or placebo bid groups. Safety assessments included adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations, and concomitant medications. Clinician- and caregiver-based efficacy measurements assessed clinically relevant, phenotypic dimensions of impairment of RTT. All dose levels were well tolerated and generally safe. Trofinetide at 200 mg\/kg bid showed statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements relative to placebo on the Rett Syndrome Behaviour Questionnaire, RTT-Clinician Domain Specific Concerns-Visual Analog Scale, and Clinical Global Impression Scale-Improvement. Exploratory analyses suggested that observed changes correlated with trofinetide exposure. These results, together with those from a previous adolescent\/adult trial, indicate trofinetide's potential for treating core RTT symptoms and support further trials. This study provides Class I evidence that for children\/adolescents with RTT, trofinetide was safe, well-tolerated, and demonstrated improvement over placebo at 200 mg\/kg bid in functionally important dimensions of RTT.","243":"Divalproex (DVP) delayed release and DVP extended release (DVP ER) are approved by the Food and Drug Administration for bipolar disorder, epilepsy, and migraine prophylaxis. Divalproex ER is given once daily, improving compliance and reducing adverse events. Overnight switch to DVP ER is advised in the package insert but could produce more adverse events in this susceptible population. In this pilot study, we compared tolerability of overnight versus gradual switching to DVP ER in 16 adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities receiving DVP, in 9 for epilepsy and in all 16 for comorbid bipolar disorder. The study design was open with parallel groups. Sixteen subjects with intellectual and developmental disabilities were randomized to overnight or gradual conversion for 4 to 6 days. A blinded rater completed the Multidimensional Observation Scale for Elderly Subjects on days +1, +4, and +8 after the switch began. We found no major differences between the 2 groups at each time point. Neither group of subjects, except for 1 subject in the overnight group, manifested sedation, seizures, worsening of tremor, or gastrointestinal adverse events. One subject in the overnight group manifested acute diarrhea and vomiting, followed by a very brief tonic leg seizure 6 days later. Larger studies are warranted.","244":null,"245":"The aim of this study was to study valproate efficacy and safety for aggression in children and adolescents with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD). In this prospective double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 30 subjects (20 boys, 10 girls) 6-20 years of age with PDD and significant aggression were randomized and received treatment with valproate (VPA) or placebo (PBO) for 8 weeks as outpatients. Mean VPA trough blood levels were 75.5 mcg\/mL at week 4 and 77.8 mcg\/mL at week 8. No treatment difference was observed statistically between VPA and PBO groups. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist--Community Scale (ABC-C) Irritability subscale was the primary outcome measure (p = 0.65), and CGI--Improvement (p = 0.16) and OAS (p = 0.96) were secondary outcome measures. Increased appetite and skin rash were significant side effects. Only 1 subject was dropped from the study owing to side effects, notably a spreading skin rash, which then resolved spontaneously. Two subjects receiving VPA developed increased serum ammonia levels, one with an associated parent report of slurred speech and mild cognitive slowing. Poststudy, of 16 VPA and PBO subjects receiving VPA, 10 subjects demonstrated sustained response, 4 of whom later attempted taper, with significant relapse of aggression. The present negative findings cannot be viewed as conclusive, partly owing to the large placebo response, subject heterogeneity, and size of the groups. Larger studies are needed to expand upon these findings.","246":"Aggression is a common and costly problem in youth with developmental disabilities.

Subjects' OAS aggression scores showed significant correlation with the already validated retrospectively rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist Community Scale irritability subscale. Further study of the OAS in outpatients with aggression and developmental disabilities is warranted.","247":"The role of vitamin D and omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 LCPUFA) in improving core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children has been investigated by a few randomised controlled trials and the results are mixed and inconclusive. The response to treatment with these nutrients is heterogenous and may be influenced by inflammatory state. As an exploratory analysis, we investigated whether inflammatory state would modulate the effect of these nutrients on core symptoms of ASD. Methods<i>:<\/i> Seventy-three New Zealand children with ASD (2.5-8.0 years) completed a 12-month randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D (VID, 2000 IU\/day), omega-3 LCPUFA; (OM, 722 mg\/day docosahexaenoic acid), or both (VIDOM). Non-fasting baseline plasma interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) was available for 67 children (VID = 15, OM = 21, VIDOM = 15, placebo = 16). Children were categorised as having undetectable\/normal IL-1\u03b2 (<3.2 pg\/ml, <i>n<\/i>=15) or elevated IL-1\u03b2 (\u22653.2 pg\/mL, <i>n<\/i> = 52). The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) questionnaire was used to assess core symptoms of ASD (baseline, 12-month). Mixed model repeated measure analyses (including all children or only children with elevated IL-1\u03b2) were used. We found evidence for an interaction between baseline IL-1\u03b2 and treatment response for SRS-total, SRS-social communicative functioning, SRS-awareness and SRS-communication (all <i>P<\/i><sub>interaction<\/sub> < 0.10). When all children were included in the analysis, two outcome comparisons (treatments vs. placebo) showed greater improvements: VID, no effect (all <i>P<\/i> > 0.10); OM and VIDOM (<i>P<\/i> = 0.01) for SRS-awareness. When only children with elevated IL-1\u03b2 were included, five outcomes showed greater improvements: OM (<i>P<\/i> = 0.01) for SRS-total; OM (<i>P<\/i> = 0.03) for SRS-social communicative functioning; VID (<i>P<\/i> = 0.01), OM (<i>P<\/i> = 0.003) and VIDOM (<i>P<\/i> = 0.01) for SRS-awareness. Inflammatory state may have modulated responses to vitamin D and omega-3 LCPUFA intervention in children with ASD, suggesting children with elevated inflammation may benefit more from daily vitamin D and omega-3 LCPUFA supplementation.","248":"Irritability and hyperactivity are common in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Because pharmacological treatments may have adverse effects, and despite limited evidence, caregivers\/parents often use dietary supplements such as vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids to address these behavioural symptoms.

New Zealand children with ASD (aged 2.5-8 years) participated in a 12-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D (2000 IU\/day, VID), omega-3 LCPUFA (722\u2009mg\/day DHA, OM), or both (2000 IU\/day vitamin D\u2009+\u2009722\u2009mg\/day DHA, VIDOM). The primary outcomes were the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist (ABC) domains of irritability and hyperactivity. Biomarkers (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and omega-3 index) and primary outcomes were measured at baseline and 12-months. Out of 111 children who completed baseline data collection, 66% completed the study (VID\u2009=\u200919, OM\u2009=\u200923, VIDOM\u2009=\u200915, placebo\u2009=\u200916). After 12 months, children receiving OM (-5.0\u2009\u00b1\u20095.0, P\u2009=\u20090.001) and VID (-4.0\u00b14.9, P\u2009=\u20090.01) had greater reduction in irritability than placebo (0.8\u00b16.1). Compared to placebo, children on VID also had greater reduction in hyperactivity (-5.2\u00b16.3 vs. -0.8\u00b15.6, P\u2009=\u20090.047).

However, there are no trials that have measured the effect of both vitamin D and n-3 LCPUFA supplementation on autism severity symptoms. The objective of this 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 factorial trial is to investigate the effect of vitamin D, n-3 LCPUFAs or a combination of both on core symptoms of ASD.

All researchers, participants and their caregivers will be blinded until the data analysis is completed, and randomisation of the active\/placebo capsules and allocation will be fully concealed from all mentioned parties. The primary outcome measures are the change in social-communicative functioning, sensory processing issues and problem behaviours between baseline and 12\u00a0months. A secondary outcome measure is the effect on gastrointestinal symptoms. Baseline data will be used to assess and correct basic nutritional deficiencies prior to treatment allocation. For safety measures, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D 25(OH)D and calcium will be monitored at baseline, 6 and 12\u00a0months, and weekly compliance and gastrointestinal symptom diaries will be completed by caregivers throughout the study period. To our knowledge there are no randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of both vitamin D and DHA supplementation on core symptoms of ASD. If it is shown that either vitamin D, DHA or both are effective, the trial would reveal a non-invasive approach to managing ASD symptoms.

Animals (Acunil: n = 17; placebo: n = 12) were observed for a 12-hr period before the administration of Acunil or the placebo (pretreatment). After 24 hr, animals were administered Acunil (1.5 mg\/kg) or a placebo (1.0-3.0 ml of sterile water) and observed again for 12 hr (posttreatment). During both treatments, animals were stimulated every 2 hr for 1 min by a person entering the enclosure (referred to as periods of stimulation). Behavioral observations and continuous heart rate, respiration rate, and motion measurements were taken throughout. Animals treated with Acunil spent more time lying with their heads folded back, eating and standing with their heads down, and less time being vigilant and exploring while walking around. Animals treated with the placebo also spent less time being vigilant and more time lying with heads up. Animals treated with Acunil groomed less while standing and performed less head shaking; no such changes were observed in the control group. Neither Acunil nor the placebo had any effect (P > 0.05) on heart rate. However, overall mean respiration rate was lowered (P = 0.02) when animals were treated with Acunil (pretreatment: 14.5 \u00b1 0.82 breaths\/min; posttreatment: 12.5 \u00b1 0.83 breaths\/min).

Here, we examined the effect of dopamine D2\/3 receptor blockade on cognition. Additionally, we explored the relation between frontal D2\/3 receptor availability and treatment effect on positive symptoms. Twenty-five antipsychotic-na\u00efve first-episode schizophrenia patients were examined with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, tested with the cognitive test battery Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery, scanned with single-photon emission computerized tomography using the dopamine D2\/3 receptor ligand [(123)I]epidepride, and scanned with MRI. After 3 months of treatment with either risperidone (n=13) or zuclopenthixol (n=9), 22 patients were reexamined. Blockade of extrastriatal dopamine D2\/3 receptors was correlated with decreased attentional focus (r = -0.615, P=.003) and planning time (r = -0.436, P=.048). Moreover, baseline frontal dopamine D2\/3 binding potential and positive symptom reduction correlated positively (D2\/3 receptor binding potential left frontal cortex rho = 0.56, P=.003; D2\/3 receptor binding potential right frontal cortex rho = 0.48, P=.016). Our data support the hypothesis of a negative influence of D2\/3 receptor blockade on specific cognitive functions in schizophrenia. This is highly clinically relevant given the well-established association between severity of cognitive disturbances and a poor functional outcome in schizophrenia. Additionally, the findings support associations between frontal D2\/3 receptor binding potential at baseline and the effect of antipsychotic treatment on positive symptoms.","253":"Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of antipsychotics can aid in therapy optimization, explaining adverse effects or non-response. One reason for therapeutic failure or adverse effects is caused by genetic variations in the cytochrome P450 drug-metabolizing genes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of CYP2D6 polymorphisms on steady-state serum concentrations of antipsychotics metabolized by CYP2D6, taking into account the co-medication with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Serum and EDTA samples were collected from 82 psychiatric patients. After a liquid-liquid extraction, serum samples were analyzed using an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (UHPLC-MS\/MS) method for quantification of the antipsychotics. CYP2D6 genotyping was performed using the Luminex xTAG\u00ae CYP2D6 Kit v3 (Luminex Corporation). Patients were divided into five phenotype subgroups by calculation of the activity score (AS): poor metabolizers (PM; AS 0), intermediate metabolizers (IM; AS 0.5-1), extensive metabolizers with slow activity (EM-s; AS 1-1.5), extensive metabolizers with fast activity (EM-f; AS 2), and ultra-rapid metabolizers (UM; AS >2). The influence of the phenotypes on the concentration-to-dose and metabolite-to-parent ratios was evaluated. Overall, 6.1 % UM (n = 5), 25.6 % EM-f (n = 21), 46.3 % EM-s (n = 38), 1.2 % EM-s\/EM-f (n = 1), 6.1 % IM (n = 5), and 14.6 % PM (n = 12) were found, taking co-administration of strong and moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors into account (phenoconversion). It was demonstrated that CYP2D6 polymorphisms affect the serum concentrations of aripiprazole (n = 18), haloperidol (n = 11), risperidone (n = 20), and zuclopenthixol (n = 6), while no influence was seen on the paliperidone serum concentrations (n = 31). Even with a small number of patients per antipsychotic, the importance of CYP2D6 genotyping was still clearly stated. This study illustrates the high potential of combining TDM and CYP2D6 genotyping in clinical practice.","254":"To test the efficacy of venlafaxine at a dose of 18.75 mg\/day on the reduction of behavioral problems such as irritability and hyperactivity\/noncompliance in patients with intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Our secondary hypothesis was that the usual doses of zuclopenthixol and\/or clonazepam would decrease in the venlafaxine-treated group. In a randomized double-blind study, we compared six patients who received venlafaxine along with their usual treatment (zuclopenthixol and\/or clonazepam) with seven patients who received placebo plus usual care. Irritability, hyperactivity\/noncompliance, and overall clinical improvement were measured after 2 and 8 weeks, using validated clinical scales. Univariate analyses showed that the symptom of irritability improved in the entire sample (p = 0.023 after 2 weeks, p = 0.061 at study endpoint), although no difference was observed between the venlafaxine and placebo groups. No significant decrease in hyperactivity\/noncompliance was observed during the study. At the end of the study, global improvement was observed in 33% of participants treated with venlafaxine and in 71% of participants in the placebo group (p = 0.29). The study found that decreased cumulative doses of clonazepam and zuclopenthixol were required for the venlafaxine group. Multivariate analyses (principal component analyses) with at least three combinations of variables showed that the two populations could be clearly separated (p b 0.05). Moreover, in all cases, the venlafaxine population had lower values for the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Behavior Problems Inventory (BPI), and levels of urea with respect to the placebo group. In one case, a reduction in the dosage of clonazepam was also suggested. For an additional set of variables (ABC factor 2, BPI frequency of aggressive behaviors, hematic ammonia at Day 28, and zuclopenthixol and clonazepam intake), the separation between the two samples was statistically significant as was the Bartlett's test, but the Kaiser\u2013Meyer\u2013Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy was below the accepted threshold. This set of variables showed a reduction in the cumulative intake of both zuclopenthixol and clonazepam. Despite the small sample sizes, this study documented a statistically significant effect of venlafaxine. Moreover, we showed that lower doses of zuclopenthixol and clonazepam were needed in the venlafaxine group, although this difference was not statistically significant. This was confirmed by multivariate analyses, where this difference reached statistical significance when using a combination of variables involving zuclopenthixol. Larger-scale studies are recommended to better investigate the effectiveness of venlafaxine treatment in patients with intellectual disabilities and ASD.","255":"Disruptive or challenging behavior problems pose a threat to children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities and their caregivers. Psychopharmacological treatment is mostly studied with new-generation antipsychotics and has been criticized for adverse side effects. This study examined the effect of the classic antipsychotic zuclopenthixol. A total of 39 boys (ages 8.0-17.11 years) with learning disabilities were included and examined for a response to zuclopenthixol during a 6 week period of open label treatment. Doses started low and were adapted individually. From responders, zuclopenthixol was randomly withdrawn for 12 weeks. Responses to withdrawal were observed by external raters using the Modified Overt Aggression Scale. Of all patients included into the study, 15 were not randomized because of insufficient therapeutic effect, adverse event, or noncompliance. Kaplan-Meier estimations showed less aggressive behavior problems for the continuing subgroup (n=9) than in the placebo group (n=15). Individual doses stayed <10\u2009mg\/day. Zuclopenthixol proved to be effective in reducing challenging behavior in boys even at low doses.","256":"The trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison with a discontinuation design. 49 mentally retarded patients with aggressive behaviour were treated with zuclopenthixol at a dose of 2-20\u2009mg\/d.

The mean dose was 10.0\u2009mg\/day (\u00b15.17); the mean serum concentration 4.19\u2009ng\/mL (\u00b13.16). Associations of dosage, serum concentration and clinical efficiency did not result in coherent patterns. Correlations with clinical efficiency measures appeared to be contradictory for dosage and serum concentrations, respectively. As no consistent associations between dosage, serum concentration, and clinical efficiency measures were found, different hypotheses explaining the results are discussed.","257":"People with mental retardation often display aggressive behavior against themselves or others making care within institutions or foster families difficult. Due to a lack of viable alternatives, antipsychotics of the first and second generations are often used for long-term treatment despite the fact that only data about short-term treatment exist. A short-time withdrawal trial of 12 weeks (n = 39) was extended at open label to 2 years. 31 patients received zuclopenthixol after the end of the withdrawal and were examined using the same instruments as in the withdrawal period (DAS, MOAS, CGI). Patients still treated with zuclopenthixol after 2 years (n = 21) benefitted, compared to the drop-outs (n = 10). Analyses of time trends revealed an early effect of zuclopenthixol which could not be enhanced afterwards. Zuclopenthixol proved to be safe and effective to keep a lower rate of aggressive behavior in adults with mental retardation also over a longer period of time.","258":"Earlier studies showed risperidone to be effective in the treatment of aggression and self-injurious behaviour in adults with mental retardation but also having adverse side effects. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of zuclopenthixol withdrawal. After open treatment with zuclopenthixol (n=49) responders were randomly assigned to continue (n=19) or discontinue (n=20) zuclopenthixol treatment during a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled period. Effects were measured using the Disability Assessment Schedule (DAS), improvement on the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI-I), and the Nurse's Observation Scale for Inpatient Evaluation (NOSIE). Ten patients (20%) discontinued the study due to insufficient therapeutic effect or adverse events in the open period. The superiority of zuclopenthixol over placebo among all randomized patients was supported not only by primary efficacy measure but also by the comparisons of mean scores of all secondary efficacy measures tested in a step-down-procedure (DAS, p<0.001; CGI-I, p<0.002, NOSIE, p<0.005). In both groups, one patient discontinued (5%) for adverse events. Adverse events were generally mild or moderate in severity. Zuclopenthixol proved to be safe and effective to keep a low rate of aggressive behaviour in adults with mental retardation.","259":"We investigated the effects of zuclopenthixol on aggressive behaviour in patients with intellectual disabilities by randomly withdrawing it after a 6-week period of open treatment. Of the 49 patients responding to the treatment, 39 took part in a randomised withdrawal trial. The placebo subgroup (n=20) showed more aggressive behaviour as indicated by outcomes observed by external raters on the Modified Overt Aggression Scale than did the continuing subgroup (n=19). The results indicate that discontinuation of zuclopenthixolin this population leads to an increase in aggressive behaviour.","260":"The present study examined basal ganglia volumes in drug-naive first-episode schizophrenic patients before and after treatment with either a specific typical or atypical antipsychotic compound. Sixteen antipsychotic drug-naive and three minimally medicated first-episode schizophrenic patients and 19 matched controls participated. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with either low doses of the typical antipsychotic drug, zuclopenthixol, or the atypical compound, risperidone. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained in patients before and after 12 weeks of exposure to medication and in controls at baseline. Caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens, and putamen volumes were measured. Compared with controls, absolute volumes of interest (VOIs) were smaller in patients at baseline and increased after treatment. However, with controls for age, gender and whole brain or intracranial volume, the only significant difference between patients and controls was a Hemisphere x Group interaction for the caudate nucleus at baseline, with controls having larger left than right caudate nuclei and patients having marginally larger right than left caudate volumes. Within patients, the two medication groups did not differ significantly with respect to volume changes after 3 months of low dose treatment in any of the VOIs. Nevertheless, when medication groups were examined separately, a significant volume increase in the putamen was evidenced in the risperidone group. The altered asymmetry in caudate volume in patients suggests intrinsic basal ganglia pathology in schizophrenia, most likely of neurodevelopmental origin.","261":"The relationship between vitamin D and sarcopenia was inconsistent between men and women. Physical activity (PA) may interact with vitamin D on sarcopenia. However, the sex-specific relationships of vitamin D, PA and sarcopenia have yet elucidated. We aimed to examine the sex differences in the relation between vitamin D status, PA levels, obesity and sarcopenia in community-dwelling middle-aged and older adults, as well as whether vitamin D status is a modifier in the relationship between PA and sarcopenia. The current study was a cross-sectional study based on the baseline survey of the West China Health and Aging Trend (WCHAT) study. A total of 3713 participants aged\u2009\u2265\u200950y were included in our study. Sarcopenia was defined according to the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) 2019 consensus. Obesity was defined by body mass index (BMI) (\u2265\u200928\u00a0kg\/m2) and body fat mass percentage (\u2265\u200960th percentile in each sex group). 25-hydroxyvitamin D was measured by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay and PA was evaluated by a validated China Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire (CLTPAQ). Multinomial logistic regression was performed to examine the relationship between PA, vitamin D and sarcopenia and obesity. Low PA was significantly associated with higher odds of sarcopenia in women only (OR\u2009=\u20091.70,95%CI:1.18,2.46, p\u2009<\u20090.01). Vitamin D deficiency was only associated with sarcopenia in men (OR\u2009=\u20091.85,95%CI: 1.27,2.69, p\u2009<\u20090.01). Low PA was significantly associated with obesity, sarcopenia, and sarcopenic obesity only in participants with serum 25(OH)D\u2009<\u200920\u00a0ng\/ml. The role of vitamin D and PA in obesity and sarcopenia was different between men and women, and the relationship between PA and sarcopenia was modified by serum vitamin D status. These findings highlighted the need to supplement vitamin D in individuals with physical inactivity and provide different interventions strategies to sarcopenia in men and women.

Vitamin D and calcium supplements increased IGF-1 but did not affect bone mineralization or turnover. Higher vitamin D in combination with sufficient calcium supplementation in such populations requires attention. Both calcium and vitamin D play an important role in bone mineralization in adolescents. In this one and a half-year randomized controlled trial, 232 participants (aged 12-15\u00a0years) were randomly assigned to three intervention groups receiving milk powder fortified with vitamin D 400\u00a0IU plus calcium 300, or 600, or 900\u00a0mg [Ca3D (n\u2009=\u200954), Ca6D (n\u2009=\u200956), and Ca9D (n\u2009=\u200949)], or one control group maintaining habitual diet [control (n\u2009=\u200973)]. Bone turnover markers, serum intact PTH, 25(OH)D, and IGF-1 levels were measured at baseline and one and a half\u00a0years, and bone mineral contents and bone areal mineral density were measured by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline, one year, and one and a half\u00a0years. Baseline average serum 25(OH)D level and calcium intake were 29.4\u00a0nmol\/L and 363.5\u00a0mg\/day, respectively. There was a significant increase in bone turnover, total body, hip, lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD), and total body BMC as well as slight fluctuations in 25(OH)D levels over one and a half\u00a0years without between-group differences. Significantly decreased serum PTH level was only observed in the Ca6D group (31%, p\u2009<\u20090.0001), in which the intervention effect was also significant (p\u2009=\u20090.0029) compared with the control group. IGF-1 levels increased significantly in all intervention groups (18.5 to 22.8%, p\u2009<\u20090.05) but decreased in the control group (16.5%, p\u2009<\u20090.05), and the group by time interaction was also significant (p\u2009=\u20090.0029). Our study showed that in healthy adolescents with low vitamin D status and calcium intake, mild vitamin D and mild to modest calcium supplements increased IGF-1 but did not affect bone mineralization or turnover. Higher vitamin D in combination with sufficient calcium supplementation in such populations requires attention.","263":"To explore the efficacy and safety of vitamin D (VD) in the treatment of idiopathic oligoasthenozoospermia. This study included 86 infertile men with idiopathic oligoasthenozoospermia, who were randomized to a VD and a control group of equal number, the former given oral VD 200 IU\/d and calcium 600 mg\/d,qd, while the latter administered oral vitamin E 100 mg and vitamin C 100 mg, tid. After 3 months of medication, we compared the semen parameters, adverse reactions, and pregnancy rate between the two groups. After medication, the count of progressively motile sperm per ejaculate was increased from (9.82 \u00b1 3.72) x 10(6) to (21.47 \u00b1 6.52) x 10(6) ( P < 0.05) and the proportion of progressively motile sperm from (18.41 \u00b1 9.82)% to (28.27 \u00b1 4.47)% (P < 0.05) in the VD group. In comparison, the count of progressively motile sperm per ejaculate was elevated from (9.51 \u00b1 6.31) x 10(6) to (12.36 \u00b1 4.43) x 10(6) (P > 0.05) and the proportion of progressively motile sperm from (17.79 \u00b1 5.25)% to (21.35 \u00b1 2.41)% (P > 0.05) in the control group. Pregnancy was achieved in 7 cases (16.3%) in the VD group, but only lease (2.3%) in the control (P < 0.05). No adverse reactions were observed in either of the groups. Vitamin D, as a safe option for the treatment of idiopathic oligoasthenozoospermia, can effectively improve the semen quality, especially the progressive sperm motility of the patient.","264":"Our objective was to know the extent to which a fall in bone turnover markers is influenced by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels in patients on alendronate (ALN) treatment. A total of 140 postmenopausal osteoporotic women were randomized to receive either ALN or ALN plus 25OHD(3) (ALN+VitD) over a 3-month period. Serum 25OHD, PTH, C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX), and amino-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (P1NP) were measured at baseline and at the end of the 3 months. 25OHD rose four times above baseline levels in the ALN+VitD group, whereas no changes were seen in the ALN group. Administering ALN resulted in a significant decline in both serum CTX (53 \u00b1 24%) and P1NP (46 \u00b1 19%). After ALN+VitD, the fall in CTX amounted to 61 \u00b1 20% (P = 0.06 compared with ALN) and P1NP to 50 \u00b1 23% (P = 0.35). When patients were divided into those below and above 20 ng\/ml of baseline serum 25OHD, in those below, CTX decreased by 48 \u00b1 26% in the ALN group and by 61 \u00b1 17% in the ALN+VitD group (P = 0.015). For P1NP, the corresponding figures were 43 \u00b1 20 and 50 \u00b1 23% (P = 0.2). In patients above 20 ng\/ml, no differences were seen regarding CTX (58 \u00b1 21% decrease in the ALN group and 60 \u00b1 23% in the ALN+VitD group; P = 0.7) or P1NP (49 \u00b1 18 and 50 \u00b1 20%; P = 0.9). Administration of 25OHD(3) is not an indispensable requirement for bisphosphonates to develop their bone antiresorptive effect. In fact, in patients with vitamin D sufficiency, no benefit is observed when the vitamin is added. However, in patients with vitamin D deficiency, an approximately 25% greater fall in the bone resorption marker CTX is seen with its administration.","265":"To investigate the clinical value of serum total procollagen type 1 aminoterminal propeptide (total P1NP), cross-linked C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (\u03b2-CTX) and 25(OH)D3 detection in evaluating the risks of fragile hip fracture in elderly patients with osteoporosis. Serum levels of total P1NP, \u03b2-CTX and 25(OH)D3 was measured in 68 elderly osteoporotic patients with fragile hip fracture and 68 age- and gender-matched osteoporotic controls without fragile hip fracture. In both groups, bone mineral density (BMD) was detected with dual X-ray absorptiometry. The serum levels of total P1NP and \u03b2-CTX were significantly higher and 25(OH)D3 level was significantly lower in fragile hip fracture group than in the control group (P<0.05), but the two groups showed no significant difference in lumbar or total hip BMD. Bivariate correlation analysis suggested that in fragile hip fracture group, serum 25(OH)D3 level was positively, while serum total P1NP and \u03b2-CTX levels were inversely correlated with lumbar and total hip BMD (P<0.05). In control group, 25(OH)D3 was not related to lumbar or total hip BMD, and serum total P1NP and \u03b2-CTX levels were inversely correlated with total hip BMD (P<0.05) but not related to lumbar BMD. In osteoporotic elderly patients with close BMD levels, high serum levels of total P1NP and \u03b2-CTX and low serum levels of 25(OH)D3 might independently indicate high fragile hip fracture risk, and detection of the three markers can help identify high-risk individuals.","266":"To evaluate quality of life (QOL) in the treatment assessment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) by comparing the QOL of three treatments: hormone replacement treatment, supplement of calcium and vitamin D and risedronate. All patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) in this clinical trial had been allocated into 4 groups: placebo therapy group, vitamin D addition calcium therapy group, hormone replacement treatment (HRT) therapy group, and risedronate therapy group. We measured the bone mineral density (BMD) and quality of life sale (QOLS) of patients in three times, before the treatment, 3 months after the treatment,and 12 months after the treatment. The differences of the QOL and BMD at the 4 groups and at different time, the linear correlation of the change of QOL and the change of BMD, were both compared after the measurement. The total score of QOL and the score of disease domain and physical domain of HRT therapy group and risedronate therapy group were higher than the placebo therapy group (F = 17. 335, P <0.001), but vitamin D addition calcium therapy group was not different from that of the placebo therapy group. The score of other three domains had no statistically significant difference among the 4 groups. The score of disease domain of the patients of risedronate therapy group started to increase after 3 months of treatment, and continued to increase after 12 months of treatment. The score of disease domain of the patients of HRT therapy group started to increase only after 12 months of treatment. But the score of disease domain of the patients of vitamin D addition calcium therapy group did not increase after 12 months of treatment. The changes of the score of disease domain had the linar correlation with the changes of BMD, and the correlation coefficient was from 0.608 to 0.827. QOL may become one of the indexes of medical treatment outcome assessment system for PMOP.","267":"The social impairments of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have a major impact on quality of life, yet there are no medications that effectively treat these core social behavior deficits. Preclinical research suggests that arginine vasopressin (AVP), a neuropeptide involved in promoting mammalian social behaviors, may be a possible treatment for ASD. Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel study design, we tested the efficacy and tolerability of a 4-week intranasal AVP daily treatment in 30 children with ASD. AVP-treated participants aged 6 to 9.5 years received the maximum daily target dose of 24 International Units (IU); participants aged 9.6 to 12.9 years received the maximum daily target dose of 32 IU. Intranasal AVP treatment compared to placebo enhanced social abilities as assessed by change from baseline in this phase 2 trial's primary outcome measure, the Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd Edition total score (SRS-2 <i>T<\/i> score; <i>F<\/i> <sub>1,20<\/sub> = 9.853; <i>P<\/i> = 0.0052; \u03b7<sub>p<\/sub> <sup>2<\/sup> = 33.0%; Cohen's <i>d<\/i> = 1.40). AVP treatment also diminished anxiety symptoms and some repetitive behaviors. Most of these findings were more pronounced when we accounted for pretreatment AVP concentrations in blood. AVP was well tolerated with minimal side effects. No AVP-treated participants dropped out of the trial, and there were no differences in the rate of adverse events reported between treatment conditions. Last, no changes from baseline were observed in vital signs, electrocardiogram tracings, height and body weight, or clinical chemistry measurements after 4 weeks of AVP treatment. These preliminary findings suggest that AVP has potential for treating social impairments in children with ASD.","268":"Propentofylline is a xanthine phosphodiesterase inhibitor and adenosine reuptake blocker with neuroprotective effects linked to anti-inflammatory and antiexcitatory properties. This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating the potential beneficial effects of propentofylline, as an adjunctive treatment with risperidone, on the severity and behavioral abnormalities of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A total of 48 children with ASD were randomly allocated into 2 groups of risperidone (initiating at 0.5 mg\/d) plus propentofylline (initiating at 300 mg\/d) and risperidone plus placebo. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) and Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) were used for the evaluation of ASD severity and behavioral disruptions at baseline, week 4, and week 10. Primary outcome measure of the study was ABC-C irritability subscale score, whereas CARS score along with other 4 subscales of ABC-C (lethargy\/social withdrawal, stereotypic behavior, hyperactivity\/noncompliance, and inappropriate speech subscales) were considered as secondary outcome measures. Results from the general linear model repeated measures analysis demonstrated significant time-treatment interaction on irritability subscale (F1.55 = 3.45; P = 0.048) and CARS (F1.41 = 4.08; P = 0.034) scores. Compared with the placebo group, children receiving propentofylline showed greater improvements in the CARS score (P = 0.037) from baseline to the study endpoint. Our results found no significant time-treatment effect on other subscales of ABC-C. Two trial groups were comparable based on the frequency of adverse effects. Our findings demonstrated that adjunctive treatment with propentofylline is effective in alleviating disease severity and improving irritability in ASD patients. However, larger studies with longer durations are required to confirm these results.","269":"This study aimed to evaluate efficacy and safety of prednisolone as an adjunctive treatment to risperidone, in children with regressive autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The current 12-week, randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled trial recruited 37 patients with regressive ASD. The participants were allocated to receive either 1 mg\/kg per day prednisolone or matched placebo in addition to risperidone. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Edition (ABC-C) scale and Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) were used to measure behavioral outcomes at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12 of the study course. The primary outcome was the change in ABC-irritability subscale score, whereas the secondary outcomes were the change in scores of other ABC-C subscales, in CARS score, and in the level of inflammatory biomarkers. Twenty-six patients completed the 12 weeks of study period. Repeated-measures analysis demonstrated significant effect for time-treatment interaction in the CARS (F (1, 2.23) = 13.22, P < 0.001), as well as 4 subscales of the ABC-C including: irritability (F (1, 2.12) = 3.84, P = 0.026), hyperactivity (F (1, 2.09) = 3.56, P = 0.039), lethargy (F (1, 2.18) = 31.50, P < 0.001), and stereotypy (F (1, 1.89) = 4.04, P = 0.026). However, no significant time-treatment interaction was identified for inappropriate speech subscale (F (1, 2.03) = 1.71, P = 0.191). In addition, inflammatory biomarkers were significantly decreased after 3 months of prednisolone add-on. No significant adverse event was detected during the trial. Prednisolone, as an add-on to risperidone, could remarkably improve core features in children with regressive ASD.","270":"Pregnenolone is a neurosteroid with modulatory effects on \u03b3-aminobutyric acid neurotransmission. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of pregnenolone add-on to risperidone in adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Sixty-four ASD patients were randomly allocated to receive either pregnenolone (n = 32) or matching placebo (n = 32) in addition to risperidone. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Edition scale was used to evaluate the behavioral status of patients at baseline, week 5, and the trial end point. The change in score of irritability subscale was the primary outcome. Frequency of adverse effects due to trial medications was compared between the treatment groups. Fifty-nine patients completed the trial (30 in pregnenolone and 29 in the placebo arm). Baseline characteristics of both treatment groups were similar (P > 0.05). Repeated measures analysis was suggestive of greater exhibited improvement for the pregnenolone group on irritability, stereotypy, and hyperactivity subscales of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Edition over the trial period (F = 3.84, df = 1.96, P = 0.025; F = 4.29, df = 1.39, P = 0.029; F = 6.55, df = 1.67, P = 0.004, respectively). Nonetheless, the alterations in lethargy and inappropriate speech domains scores were similar for both arms (F = 0.93, df = 1.49, P = 0.375; F = 1.10, df = 1.60, P = 0.325, respectively). There was no significant difference in frequency as well as severity of adverse effects between the 2 groups. Pregnenolone adjunct to risperidone could attenuate core features associated with ASD.","271":"IMPORTANCE: Atypical antipsychotic medications are indicated for the treatment of irritability and agitation symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Unfortunately, these medications are associated with weight gain and metabolic complications that are especially troubling in children and with long-term use. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of metformin for weight gain associated with atypical antipsychotic medications in children and adolescents with ASD (defined in the protocol as DSM-IV diagnosis of autistic disorder, Asperger disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified), aged 6 to 17 years. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial was conducted at 4 centers in Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Columbus, Ohio; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Nashville, Tennessee. In all, 209 potential participants were screened by telephone, 69 individuals provided consent, and 61 participants were randomized to receive metformin or placebo between April 26, 2013, and June 24, 2015. INTERVENTIONS: Metformin or matching placebo titrated up to 500 mg twice daily for children aged 6 to 9 years and 850 mg twice daily for those 10 to 17 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was change in body mass index (BMI) z score during 16 weeks of treatment. Secondary outcomes included changes in additional body composition and metabolic variables. Safety, tolerability, and efficacy analyses all used a modified intent-to-treat sample comprising all participants who received at least 1 dose of medication. RESULTS: Of the 61 randomized participants, 60 participants initiated treatment (45 [75%] male; mean [SD] age, 12.8 [2.7] years). Metformin reduced BMI z scores from baseline to week 16 significantly more than placebo (difference in 16-week change scores vs placebo, -0.10 [95% CI, -0.16 to -0.04]; P\u2009=\u2009.003). Statistically significant improvements were also noted in secondary body composition measures (raw BMI, -0.95 [95% CI, -1.46 to -0.45] and raw weight, -2.73 [95% CI, -4.04 to -1.43]) but not in metabolic variables. Overall, metformin was well tolerated. Five participants in the metformin group discontinued treatment owing to adverse events (agitation, 4; sedation, 1). Participants receiving metformin vs placebo experienced gastrointestinal adverse events during a significantly higher percentage of treatment days (25.1% vs 6.8%; P\u2009=\u2009.005). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Metformin may be effective in decreasing weight gain associated with atypical antipsychotic use and is well tolerated by children and adolescents with ASD.","272":"Increasing evidence suggests that the function of the GABAergic system is abnormally low in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Baclofen, which functions as a selective agonist for GABA(B) receptors, does appear promising for the treatment of ASD. We conducted a 10-week randomized-controlled study aimed at evaluating the potential of baclofen as an adjuvant therapy to enhance the effect of risperidone in children with ASD. Sixty-four children (3-12 years) with moderate-to-severe irritability symptoms of ASD were included. We used the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Edition (ABC-C) for the outcome measures on each of the follow-up visits (weeks 0, 5, and 10). Analysis of the combined data revealed significant improvement for all the ABC subscales (irritability: F\u2009=\u200951.644, df\u2009=\u20091.66, p\u2009<\u20090.001, lethargy: F\u2009=\u200939.734, df\u2009=\u20091.38, p\u2009<\u20090.001, stereotypic behavior: F\u2009=\u200925.495, df\u2009=\u20091.56, p\u2009<\u20090.001, hyperactivity: F\u2009=\u200954.135, df\u2009=\u20091.35, p\u2009<\u20090.001, and inappropriate speech: F\u2009=\u200919.277, df\u2009=\u20091.47, p\u2009=\u20090.004). Combined treatment with baclofen and risperidone exerted a greater effect on improvement of hyperactivity symptoms at both midpoint [Cohen's d, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u2009-\u20093.14, -\u20095.56 to -\u20090.72] and endpoint (d, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-\u20094.45, -\u20098.74 to -\u20090.16) when compared with treatment with placebo plus risperidone. The two treatments achieved comparable results for other outcome measures. Our data support safety and efficacy of baclofen as an adjuvant to risperidone for improvement of hyperactivity symptoms in children with ASD.","273":"A decrease in interaction between brain regions is observed in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which is believed to be related to restricted neural network access in ASD. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, has revealed benefit during performance of tasks involving flexibility of access to networks, a benefit also seen in ASD. Our goal was to determine the effect of propranolol on functional connectivity in ASD during a verbal decision making task as compared to nadolol, thereby accounting for the potential spurious fMRI effects due to peripheral hemodynamic effects of propranolol. Ten ASD subjects underwent fMRI scans after administration of placebo, propranolol or nadolol, while performing a phonological decision making task. Comparison of functional connectivity between pre-defined ROI-pairs revealed a significant increase with propranolol compared to nadolol, suggesting a potential imaging marker for the cognitive effects of propranolol in ASD.","274":"Objective: Studies interrogating therapeutics which alter the excitation-inhibition balance in the treatment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have reported mixed results on social and behavioral outcomes. Methods: The aim of this randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled pilot trial was to evaluate neurocognitive effects of memantine over a 24-week trial. Twenty-three children ages 6-12 years old with ASD were randomized to memantine or placebo. Primary outcomes included measures of apraxia and expressive language with evaluations at midpoint (week 12) and endpoint (week 24). Secondary outcomes included memory and adaptive behavior measures. Exploratory outcomes included changes in overall cognitive functioning and behavior (e.g., Aberrant Behavior Checklist). Results: Results suggest that memantine was well-tolerated. Dropout rates were high across groups with only 14 participants completing the 6-month trial. Memantine was not associated with improvements in apraxia and expressive language. Treatment with memantine was associated with improvements in verbal recognition memory as measured by the Narrative Memory-Recognition (NEPSY-II) (F\u2009=\u20095.05, p\u2009=\u2009.03). In addition, exploratory analyses of changes in Intelligence quotient (IQ) suggest improvements on verbal IQ (d\u2009=\u20091.8). Conclusions: Results suggest future studies of memantine in ASD may benefit from shifting treatment targets from social and behavioral outcomes to exploration of effects of memantine on cognition, potentially as an adjunct to learning and educational interventions.","275":"The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of the anticonvulsant levetiracetam in the treatment of children with autism. A previous open-label study in autistic children treated with levetiracetam demonstrated effectiveness in hyperactivity, impulsivity\/aggression, and mood lability. Twenty patients with autism ranging from 5 to 17 years of age were entered into a 10-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of levetiracetam versus placebo. The mean maximum dosage for levetiracetam was 862.50+\/-279.19 mg\/day. We evaluated global improvement of autism with the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) Scale and aggression and affective instability with the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) parent and teacher ratings. We measured repetitive behaviors using the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) score and impulsivity and hyperactivity with the Conners' Rating Scale-Revised: Long Version for parent and teacher. No significant difference was found between levetiracetam and placebo groups comparing the change in CGI-I (t=0.350, d.f.=13.621, P=0.765), nor on change in ABC, CY-BOCS or Conners' scales. These findings suggest that levetiracetam does not improve behavioral disturbances of autism, but are limited by the small sample size and lack of stratification of the autistic sample at baseline.","276":"The social impairments of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have a major impact on quality of life, yet there are no medications that effectively treat these core social behavior deficits.

In this prospective, parallel, single-blinded, randomized study, we investigate the modulation effect of three-week tDCS treatment at the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in children with ASD. 47 children with ASD were enrolled, and 40 (20 in each group) completed the study. The primary outcomes are Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), and the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R). We found that children with ASD can tolerate three-week tDCS treatment with no serious adverse events detected. A within-group comparison showed that real tDCS, but not sham tDCS, can significantly reduce the scores of CARS, Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ), and general impressions in CARS (15th item). Real tDCS produced significant score reduction in the CSHQ and in CARS general impressions when compared to the effects of sham tDCS. The pilot study suggests that three-week left DLPFC tDCS is well-tolerated and may hold potential in relieving some symptoms in children with ASD.","278":"OBJECTIVE: Hyperactivity, impulsiveness, and distractibility are common problems in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

METHOD: In a multisite, randomized clinical trial, extended-release guanfacine was compared with placebo in children with ASD accompanied by hyperactivity, impulsiveness, and distractibility. RESULTS: Sixty-two subjects (boys, N=53; girls, N=9; mean age=8.5 years [SD=2.25]) were randomly assigned to guanfacine (N=30) or placebo (N=32) for 8 weeks. The guanfacine group showed a 43.6% decline in scores on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-hyperactivity subscale (least squares mean from 34.2 to 19.3) compared with a 13.2% decrease in the placebo group (least squares mean from 34.2 to 29.7; effect size=1.67). The rate of positive response (much improved or very much improved on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale) was 50% (15 of 30) for guanfacine compared with 9.4% (3 of 32) for placebo. A brief cognitive battery tapping working memory and motor planning showed no group differences before or after 8 weeks of treatment. The modal dose of guanfacine at week 8 was 3 mg\/day (range: 1-4 mg\/day), and the modal dose was 3 mg\/day (range: 2-4 mg\/day) for placebo. Four guanfacine-treated subjects (13.3%) and four placebo subjects (12.5%) exited the study before week 8. The most common adverse events included drowsiness, fatigue, and decreased appetite. There were no significant changes on ECG in either group. For subjects in the guanfacine group, blood pressure declined in the first 4 weeks, with return nearly to baseline by endpoint (week 8). Pulse rate showed a similar pattern but remained lower than baseline at endpoint. CONCLUSIONS: Extended-release guanfacine appears to be safe and effective for reducing hyperactivity, impulsiveness, and distractibility in children with ASD.","279":"BACKGROUND: Endocannabinoid dysfunction in animal models of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and accumulating, albeit anecdotal, evidence for efficacy in humans motivated this placebo-controlled double-blind comparison of two oral cannabinoid solutions in 150 participants (age 5-21 years) with ASD. METHODS: We tested (1) BOL-DP-O-01-W, a whole-plant cannabis extract containing cannabidiol and \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol at a 20:1 ratio and (2) BOL-DP-O-01, purified cannabidiol and \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol at the same ratio. Participants (N\u2009=\u2009150) received either placebo or cannabinoids for 12-weeks (testing efficacy) followed by a 4-week washout and predetermined cross-over for another 12 weeks to further assess tolerability. Registered primary efficacy outcome measures were improvement in behavioral problems (differences between whole-plant extract and placebo) on the Home Situation Questionnaire-ASD (HSQ-ASD) and the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale with disruptive behavior anchor points (CGI-I). Secondary measures were Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2) and Autism Parenting Stress Index (APSI). RESULTS: Changes in Total Scores of HSQ-ASD (primary-outcome) and APSI (secondary-outcome) did not differ among groups. Disruptive behavior on the CGI-I (co-primary outcome) was either much or very much improved in 49% on whole-plant extract (n\u2009=\u200945) versus 21% on placebo (n\u2009=\u200947; p\u2009=\u20090.005). Median SRS Total Score (secondary-outcome) improved by 14.9 on whole-plant extract (n\u2009=\u200934) versus 3.6 points after placebo (n\u2009=\u200936); p\u2009=\u20090.009). There were no treatment-related serious adverse events. Common adverse events included somnolence and decreased appetite, reported for 28% and 25% on whole-plant extract, respectively (n\u2009=\u200995); 23% and 21% on pure-cannabinoids (n\u2009=\u200993), and 8% and 15% on placebo (n\u2009=\u200994). Limitations Lack of pharmacokinetic data and a wide range of ages and functional levels among participants warrant caution when interpreting the results. CONCLUSIONS: This interventional study provides evidence that BOL-DP-O-01-W and BOL-DP-O-01, administrated for 3 months, are well tolerated. Evidence for efficacy of these interventions are mixed and insufficient. Further testing of cannabinoids in ASD is recommended.","280":"Objective: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like sertraline have been shown in observational studies and anecdotal reports to improve language development in young children with fragile X syndrome (FXS). A previous controlled trial of sertraline in young children with FXS found significant improvement in expressive language development as measured by the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) among those with comorbid autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in post hoc analysis, prompting the authors to probe whether sertraline is also indicated in nonsyndromic ASD. Methods: The authors evaluated the efficacy of 6 months of treatment with low-dose sertraline in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 58 children with ASD aged 24 to 72 months. Results: 179 subjects were screened for eligibility, and 58 were randomized to sertraline (32) or placebo (26). Eight subjects from the sertraline arm and five from the placebo arm discontinued. Intent-to-treat analysis showed no significant difference from placebo on the primary outcomes (MSEL expressive language raw score and age equivalent combined score) or secondary outcomes. Sertraline was well tolerated, with no difference in side effects between sertraline and placebo groups. No serious adverse events possibly related to study treatment occurred. Conclusion: This randomized controlled trial of sertraline treatment showed no benefit with respect to primary or secondary outcome measures. For the 6-month period, treatment in young children with ASD appears safe, although the long-term side effects of low-dose sertraline in early childhood are unknown.","281":"The microbiota-gut-brain axis has been recently recognized as a key modulator of neuropsychiatric health. In this framework, probiotics (recently named \"psychobiotics\") may modulate brain activity and function, possibly improving the behavioral profiles of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We evaluated the effects of probiotics on autism in a double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 85 preschoolers with ASD (mean age, 4.2 years; 84% boys). Participants were randomly assigned to probiotics (De Simone Formulation) (n=42) or placebo (n=43) for six months. Sixty-three (74%) children completed the trial. No differences between groups were detected on the primary outcome measure, the Total Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule - Calibrated Severity Score (ADOS-CSS). An exploratory secondary analysis on subgroups of children with or without Gastrointestinal Symptoms (GI group, n= 30; NGI group, n=55) revealed in the NGI group treated with probiotics a significant decline in ADOS scores as compared to that in the placebo group, with a mean reduction of 0.81 in Total ADOS CSS and of 1.14 in Social-Affect ADOS CSS over six months. In the GI group treated with probiotics we found greater improvements in some GI symptoms, adaptive functioning, and sensory profiles than in the GI group treated with placebo. These results suggest potentially positive effects of probiotics on core autism symptoms in a subset of ASD children independent of the specific intermediation of the probiotic effect on GI symptoms. Further studies are warranted to replicate and extend these promising findings on a wider population with subsets of ASD patients which share targets of intervention on the microbiota-gut-brain axis.
