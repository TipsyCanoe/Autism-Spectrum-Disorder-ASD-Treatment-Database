This study examined the effect of divalproex sodium for irritability\\\/aggression in children and adolescents with ASD. This was a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. All efficacy measures were obtained by an independent evaluator blinded to randomization condition and side effects. A total of 55 subjects gavetheir consent and 27 were randomized in a 1 : 1 manner (mean age 9.46+\\\/-2.46, mean nonverbal IQ 63.3+\\\/-23.9). Two subjects from the active group and one subject from the placebo group discontinued the study because of either a lack of efficacy or side effects (increased irritability). Primary outcome measures were Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability subscale and Clinical Global Impression-Improvement, which focused on irritability. Overall, 62.5% of divalproex subjects vs 9% of placebo subjects were responders (CGI-irritability OR: 16.7, Fisher's exact p=0.008).

Therefore, bumetanide is a promising novel therapeutic agent to treat autism.

{"prompt":"{\"PMID\":26361994,\"DOI\":\"10.1016\\\/J.Pnpbp.2015.09.002\",\"Title\":\"Using venlafaxine to treat behavioral disorders in patients with autism spectrum disorder.\",\"Abstract\":\"To test the efficacy of venlafaxine at a dose of 18.75 mg\\\/day on the reduction of behavioral problems such as irritability and hyperactivity\\\/noncompliance in patients with intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Our secondary hypothesis was that the usual doses of zuclopenthixol and\\\/or clonazepam would decrease in the venlafaxine-treated group. In a randomized double-blind study, we compared six patients who received venlafaxine along with their usual treatment (zuclopenthixol and\\\/or clonazepam) with seven patients who received placebo plus usual care. Irritability, hyperactivity\\\/noncompliance, and overall clinical improvement were measured after 2 and 8 weeks, using validated clinical scales. Univariate analyses showed that the symptom of irritability improved in the entire sample (p = 0.023 after 2 weeks, p = 0.061 at study endpoint), although no difference was observed between the venlafaxine and placebo groups. No significant decrease in hyperactivity\\\/noncompliance was observed during the study. At the end of the study, global improvement was observed in 33% of participants treated with venlafaxine and in 71% of participants in the placebo group (p = 0.29). The study found that decreased cumulative doses of clonazepam and zuclopenthixol were required for the venlafaxine group. Multivariate analyses (principal component analyses) with at least three combinations of variables showed that the two populations could be clearly separated (p b 0.05). Moreover, in all cases, the venlafaxine population had lower values for the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Behavior Problems Inventory (BPI), and levels of urea with respect to the placebo group. In one case, a reduction in the dosage of clonazepam was also suggested. For an additional set of variables (ABC factor 2, BPI frequency of aggressive behaviors, hematic ammonia at Day 28, and zuclopenthixol and clonazepam intake), the separation between the two samples was statistically significant as was the Bartlett's test, but the Kaiser\\u2013Meyer\\u2013Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy was below the accepted threshold. This set of variables showed a reduction in the cumulative intake of both zuclopenthixol and clonazepam. Despite the small sample sizes, this study documented a statistically significant effect of venlafaxine.

Our secondary hypothesis was that the usual doses of zuclopenthixol and\\\/or clonazepam would decrease in the venlafaxine-treated group. In a randomized double-blind study, we compared six patients who received venlafaxine along with their usual treatment (zuclopenthixol and\\\/or clonazepam) with seven patients who received placebo plus usual care. Irritability, hyperactivity\\\/noncompliance, and overall clinical improvement were measured after 2 and 8 weeks, using validated clinical scales. Univariate analyses showed that the symptom of irritability improved in the entire sample (p = 0.023 after 2 weeks, p = 0.061 at study endpoint), although no difference was observed between the venlafaxine and placebo groups. No significant decrease in hyperactivity\\\/noncompliance was observed during the study. At the end of the study, global improvement was observed in 33% of participants treated with venlafaxine and in 71% of participants in the placebo group (p = 0.29). The study found that decreased cumulative doses of clonazepam and zuclopenthixol were required for the venlafaxine group. Multivariate analyses (principal component analyses) with at least three combinations of variables showed that the two populations could be clearly separated (p b 0.05). Moreover, in all cases, the venlafaxine population had lower values for the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Behavior Problems Inventory (BPI), and levels of urea with respect to the placebo group. In one case, a reduction in the dosage of clonazepam was also suggested. For an additional set of variables (ABC factor 2, BPI frequency of aggressive behaviors, hematic ammonia at Day 28, and zuclopenthixol and clonazepam intake), the separation between the two samples was statistically significant as was the Bartlett's test, but the Kaiser\\u2013Meyer\\u2013Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy was below the accepted threshold. This set of variables showed a reduction in the cumulative intake of both zuclopenthixol and clonazepam. Despite the small sample sizes, this study documented a statistically significant effect of venlafaxine. Moreover, we showed that lower doses of zuclopenthixol and clonazepam were needed in the venlafaxine group, although this difference was not statistically significant. This was confirmed by multivariate analyses, where this difference reached statistical significance when using a combination of variables involving zuclopenthixol.

Since oxytocin reduced the primary endpoint, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) reciprocity, (from 8.5 to 7.7; P\\u2009<\\u2009.001) but placebo also reduced the score (8.3 to 7.2; P\\u2009<\\u2009.001), no between-group difference was found (effect size -0.08; 95% CI, -0.46 to 0.31; P\\u2009=\\u2009.69); however, plasma oxytocin was only elevated from baseline to endpoint in the oxytocin-group compared with the placebo-group (effect size -1.12; -1.53 to -0.70; P\\u2009<\\u2009.0001). Among the secondary endpoints, oxytocin reduced ADOS repetitive behavior (2.0 to 1.5; P\\u2009<\\u2009.0001) compared with placebo (2.0 to 1.8; P\\u2009=\\u2009.43) (effect size 0.44; 0.05 to 0.83; P\\u2009=\\u2009.026). In addition, the duration of gaze fixation on socially relevant regions, another secondary endpoint, was increased by oxytocin (41.2 to 52.3; P\\u2009=\\u2009.03) compared with placebo (45.7 to 40.4; P\\u2009=\\u2009.25) (effect size 0.55; 0.10 to 1.0; P\\u2009=\\u2009.018). No significant effects were observed for the other secondary endpoints. No significant difference in the prevalence of adverse events was observed between groups, although one participant experienced temporary gynecomastia during oxytocin administration. Based on the present findings, we cannot recommend continuous intranasal oxytocin treatment alone at the current dose and duration for treatment of the core social symptoms of high-functioning ASD in adult men, although this large-scale trial suggests oxytocin's possibility to treat ASD repetitive behavior.\",\"Authors\":\"Yamasue Hidenori, Okada Takashi, Munesue Toshio, Kuroda Miho, Fujioka Toru, Uno Yota, Matsumoto Kaori, Kuwabara Hitoshi, Mori Daisuke, Okamoto Yuko, Yoshimura Yuko, Kawakubo Yuki, Arioka Yuko, Kojima Masaki, Yuhi Teruko, Owada Keiho, Yassin Walid, Kushima Itaru, Benner Seico, Ogawa Nanayo, Eriguchi Yosuke, Kawano Naoko, Uemura Yukari, Yamamoto Maeri, Kano Yukiko, Kasai Kiyoto, Higashida Haruhiro, Ozaki Norio, Kosaka Hirotaka\",\"Journal\":\"Molecular psychiatry\",\"Keywords\":\"Administration, Intranasal, Adolescent, Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Double-Blind Method, Gynecomastia, Humans, Japan, Male, Middle Aged, Oxytocin, Young Adult\",\"URL\":\"https:\\\/\\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\\/pubmed\\\/29955161\",\"Affiliations\":\"Graduate School of Psychology, Kanazawa Institute of Technology, 7-1 Ohgigaoka, Nonoichi, 921-8054, Japan.; Research Center for Child Mental Development, University of Fukui, Eiheiji, Fukui, 910-1193, Japan.; Department of Child Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.; Department of Psychiatry, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, 65 Tsurumai-cho, Showa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, 466-8550, Japan.; Department of Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.; Department of Psychiatry, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashiku, Hamamatsu City, 431-3192, Japan. yamasue@hama-med.ac.jp.; Research Center for Child Mental Development, Kanazawa University, 13-1 Takara-machi, Kanazawa, 920-8640, Japan.; Biostatistics Division, Clinical Research Support Center, University of Tokyo Hospital, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.\",\"Treatment name\":\"Oxytocin \",\"Liquid available\":null,\"ODT available\":null,\"First Author\":\"Yamasue, Hidenori\",\"DOI.1\":\"10.1038\\\/s41380-018-0097-2\",\"Commercial Affiliation\":null,\"Date of publication\":\"2020\",\"Journal.1\":\"Molecular Psychiatry\",\"Study type\":\"Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled  \",\"Duration\":\"6 weeks\",\"n=\":106.0,\"M:F ratio\":null,\"Age range\\\/mean\":\"18-48 y\",\"Medication\\\/Treatment Dose Range \":\"48 IU\\\/d\",\"Primary Outcome Area\":null,\"Primary Outcome Measures\":\"ADOS; oxytocin plasma levels\",\"Results: Primary measure\":\"Both placebo and oxytocin treatment groups had reduced scores, no treatment difference.

After 52 weeks of continuous treatment (PedPRM-randomized group) subjects slept (mean [SE]) 62.08 (21.5) minutes longer (<i>p<\\\/i>\\u2009=\\u20090.007); fell asleep 48.6 (10.2) minutes faster (<i>p<\\\/i>\\u2009<\\u20090.001); had 89.1 (25.5) minutes longer uninterrupted sleep episodes (<i>p<\\\/i>\\u2009=\\u20090.001); 0.41 (0.12) less nightly awakenings (>50% decrease; <i>p<\\\/i>\\u2009=\\u20090.001); and better sleep quality (<i>p<\\\/i>\\u2009<\\u20090.001) compared with baseline. The placebo-randomized group also improved with PedPRM. Altogether, by the end of 39-week follow-up, regardless of randomization assignment, 55\\\/72 (76%) of completers achieved overall improvement of \\u22651 hour in total sleep time (TST), sleep latency or both, over baseline, with no evidence of decreased efficacy. In parallel, CSDI child sleep disturbance and caregivers' satisfaction of their child's sleep patterns (<i>p<\\\/i>\\u2009<\\u20090.001 for both), PSQI global (<i>p<\\\/i>\\u2009<\\u20090.001), and WHO-5 (<i>p<\\\/i>\\u2009=\\u20090.001) improved in statistically significant and clinically relevant manner (<i>n<\\\/i>\\u2009=\\u200972) compared with baseline. PedPRM was generally safe; most frequent treatment-related adverse events were fatigue (5.3%) and mood swings (3.2% of patients). <b><i>Conclusion:<\\\/i><\\\/b> PedPRM, an easily swallowed formulation shown to be efficacious versus placebo, is an efficacious and safe option for long-term treatment (up to 52 weeks reported here) of children with ASD and NGD who suffer from insomnia and subsequently improves caregivers' quality of life.\",\"Authors\":\"Maras Athanasios, Schroder Carmen M, Malow Beth A, Findling Robert L, Breddy John, Nir Tali, Shahmoon Shiri, Zisapel Nava, Gringras Paul\",\"Journal\":\"Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology\",\"Keywords\":\"Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Central Nervous System Depressants, Child, Communication Disorders, Comorbidity, Delayed-Action Preparations, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Drug Monitoring, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Melatonin, Polysomnography, Quality of Life, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders, Treatment Outcome\",\"URL\":\"https:\\\/\\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\\/pubmed\\\/30132686\",\"Affiliations\":\"Sleep Division, Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Kennedy Krieger Institute\\\/Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.; Strasbourg University Hospital Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Strasbourg, France.; Children's Sleep Medicine, Evelina London Children's Hospital, Guy's and St. Thomas', London, United Kingdom.; Yulius Academy, Yulius Mental Health Organization, Barendrecht, The Netherlands.; Pharmastat Consulting Ltd., Canterbury, United Kingdom.; Neurim Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Tel Aviv, Israel.\",\"Treatment name\":\"rTMS\",\"Liquid available\":null,\"ODT available\":null,\"First Author\":\"Ameis, Stephanie\",\"DOI.1\":\"doi:10.1016\\\/j.brs.2020.01.007.\",\"Commercial Affiliation\":\"Brainsway Ltd\",\"Date of publication\":\"2020\",\"Journal.1\":\"Brain Stimulation\",\"Study type\":\"RCT - sham controlled\",\"Duration\":\"4-weeks (20-session)\",\"n=\":40.0,\"M:F ratio\":\"28 M: 12 F\",\"Age range\\\/mean\":\"16-35 y \",\"Medication\\\/Treatment Dose Range \":\"20 Hz rTMS targeting DLPFC\",\"Primary Outcome Area\":\"Executive functioning\",\"Primary Outcome Measures\":\"BRIEF-SR, BRIEF-A, BRIEF-MCI, CANTAB SWM task\",\"Results: Primary measure\":\"Baseline SWM total errors and BRIEF-MCI scores predicted treatment outcome. \",\"Secondary Outcome Area\":\"Potential moderators\",\"Secondary Outcome Measures\":\"VABS-II and gender\",\"Results: Secondary Measures\":\"Baseline adaptive functioning and gender possibly moderated effects of rTMS.

A superior effect was found on one of the secondary outcomes, the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (mean difference\\u00a0-4.16, 95% CI\\u00a0=\\u00a0-8.06 to\\u00a0-0.25, p\\u00a0= .0375), but not on the Sensory Profile (mean difference 5.64, 95% CI\\u00a0=\\u00a0-11.30 to 22.57, p\\u00a0= .508) or the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability Subscale (mean difference\\u00a0-0.65, 95% CI\\u00a0=\\u00a0-2.83 to 1.52, p\\u00a0= .552). No significant wash-out effect was observed. Significant adverse effects were predominantly diuretic effects (orthostatic hypotension (17 [36%] versus 5 [11%], p\\u00a0= .007); hypokalemia (24 [51%] versus 0 [0%], p\\u00a0< .0001), the occurrence of which did not statistically influence treatment outcome. The trial outcome was negative in terms of no superior effect on the primary outcome. The secondary outcomes suggest efficacy on repetitive behavior symptoms for a subset of patients.

Oxytocin has been administered in clinical practice to many children with autism spectrum disorder. We conducted a 24-week, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial of intranasal oxytocin therapy in children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with autism spectrum disorder. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, with stratification according to age and verbal fluency, to receive oxytocin or placebo, administered intranasally, with a total target dose of 48 international units daily. The primary outcome was the least-squares mean change from baseline on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist modified Social Withdrawal subscale (ABC-mSW), which includes 13 items (scores range from 0 to 39, with higher scores indicating less social interaction). Secondary outcomes included two additional measures of social function and an abbreviated measure of IQ. Of the 355 children and adolescents who underwent screening, 290 were enrolled. A total of 146 participants were assigned to the oxytocin group and 144 to the placebo group; 139 and 138 participants, respectively, completed both the baseline and at least one postbaseline ABC-mSW assessments and were included in the modified intention-to-treat analyses. The least-squares mean change from baseline in the ABC-mSW score (primary outcome) was -3.7 in the oxytocin group and -3.5 in the placebo group (least-squares mean difference, -0.2; 95% confidence interval, -1.5 to 1.0; P\\u2009=\\u20090.61). Secondary outcomes generally did not differ between the trial groups. The incidence and severity of adverse events were similar in the two groups. This placebo-controlled trial of intranasal oxytocin therapy in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder showed no significant between-group differences in the least-squares mean change from baseline on measures of social or cognitive functioning over a period of 24 weeks.

Oxytocin has been administered in clinical practice to many children with autism spectrum disorder. We conducted a 24-week, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial of intranasal oxytocin therapy in children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with autism spectrum disorder. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, with stratification according to age and verbal fluency, to receive oxytocin or placebo, administered intranasally, with a total target dose of 48 international units daily. The primary outcome was the least-squares mean change from baseline on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist modified Social Withdrawal subscale (ABC-mSW), which includes 13 items (scores range from 0 to 39, with higher scores indicating less social interaction). Secondary outcomes included two additional measures of social function and an abbreviated measure of IQ. Of the 355 children and adolescents who underwent screening, 290 were enrolled. A total of 146 participants were assigned to the oxytocin group and 144 to the placebo group; 139 and 138 participants, respectively, completed both the baseline and at least one postbaseline ABC-mSW assessments and were included in the modified intention-to-treat analyses. The least-squares mean change from baseline in the ABC-mSW score (primary outcome) was -3.7 in the oxytocin group and -3.5 in the placebo group (least-squares mean difference, -0.2; 95% confidence interval, -1.5 to 1.0; P\\u2009=\\u20090.61). Secondary outcomes generally did not differ between the trial groups. The incidence and severity of adverse events were similar in the two groups. This placebo-controlled trial of intranasal oxytocin therapy in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder showed no significant between-group differences in the least-squares mean change from baseline on measures of social or cognitive functioning over a period of 24 weeks.

Both biochemical and clinical outcomes were examined. Biochemically, FEN led to an increase in dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and decreases in whole-blood serotonin (5-HT), plasma norepinephrine (NE), and plasma 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG). The decrease in whole-blood 5-HT was seen only during treatment with FEN. However, NE levels did not return to baseline as long as 8 weeks after the first FEN treatment period. Increases in DOPAC were greater during the second FEN treatment period than the first. Persistent changes in catecholamine regulation may be related to previously reported long-term effects on central nervous system 5-HT after FEN. Clinically, FEN led to a modest decrease in parent, but not teacher, ratings of hyperactivity and to a small reduction in sensorimotor abnormalities. Abnormal social and affectual responses also decreased, but this was not directly related to FEN treatment. Effects on cognition were equivocal.
