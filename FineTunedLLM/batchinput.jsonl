This multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study included outpatients experiencing a manic or mixed episode (with or without psychotic features). Patients with partial nonresponse to lithium/valproate monotherapy (defined as a Young Mania Rating Scale total score >=16 at the end of phases 1 and 2, with a decrease of <=25% between phases) with target serum concentrations of lithium (0.6-1.0 mmol/liter) or valproate (50-125 Âµg/ml) were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to adjunctive aripiprazole (N=253; 15 or 30 mg/day) or placebo (N=131) for 6 weeks. Mean improvement from baseline in Young Mania Rating Scale total score at week 6 (primary endpoint) was significantly greater with aripiprazole (-13.3) than with placebo (-10.7). Significant improvements in Young Mania Rating Scale total score with aripiprazole versus placebo occurred from week 1 onward. In addition, the mean improvement in Clinical Global Impression Bipolar Version (CGI-BP) severity of illness (mania) score from baseline to week 6 was significantly greater with aripiprazole (-1.9) than with placebo (-1.6). Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were higher with aripiprazole than with placebo (9% versus 5%, respectively). Akathisia was the most frequently reported extrapyramidal symptom-related adverse event and occurred significantly more frequently among those receiving aripiprazole (18.6%) than among those receiving placebo (5.4%). There were no significant differences between treatments in weight change from baseline to week 6 (+0.55 kg and +0.23 kg for aripiprazole and placebo, respectively; last observation carried forward). Adjunctive aripiprazole therapy showed significant improvements in mania symptoms as early as week 1 and demonstrated a tolerability profile similar to that of monotherapy studies."}],"max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

The Part C Early Intervention (EI) system, which is publicly funded and available in all U.S. states, offers an optimal infrastructure through which toddlers can receive NDBIs. This study seeks to assess the effectiveness and fit of one NDBI, Caregiver Implemented Reciprocal Imitation Teaching (CI-RIT), within the Part C EI system. This hybrid type 1 effectiveness/implementation trial uses a multi-site randomized control design to simultaneously test effectiveness and collect implementation data on CI-RIT in the Part C EI system across four states: Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan and Washington. Participants include EI providers (target n=160) who are randomized to either CI-RIT or treatment as usual (TAU), and child/caregiver dyads on their caseloads (target n=440). Primary effectiveness outcomes focus on (1) child social communication, joint attention, motor imitation; and (2) caregiver responsivity, implementation fidelity of RIT, and self-efficacy, which are all measured at baseline and then 4-months and 9-months after baseline. Implementation outcomes include CI-RIT modifications, treatment acceptability, fidelity of CI-RIT coaching, and RIT session completion. This study represents a critical effort to transport an evidence-based NDBI, CI-RIT, into a national service delivery setting, the Part C EI system. The large, multi-site nature of the trial provides the opportunity to address critical questions about training and intervention effectiveness, which will, in turn, optimize and support CI-RIT implementation at scale. The trial protocol is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05114538; Registration date: 10/28/2021)."}],"max_completion_tokens": 1000}}
