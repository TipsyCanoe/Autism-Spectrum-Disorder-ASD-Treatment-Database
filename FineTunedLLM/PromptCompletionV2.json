Further studies are warranted to replicate and extend these promising findings on a wider population with subsets of ASD patients which share targets of intervention on the microbiota-gut-brain axis. \",\"Authors\":\"Elisa Santocchi, Letizia Guiducci, Margherita Prosperi, Sara Calderoni, Melania Gaggini, Fabio Apicella, Raffaella Tancredi, Lucia Billeci, Paola Mastromarino, Enzo Grossi, Amalia Gastaldelli, Maria Aurora Morales, Elisa Santocchi, Letizia Guiducci, Margherita Prosperi, Sara Calderoni, Melania Gaggini, Fabio Apicella, Raffaella Tancredi, Lucia Billeci, Paola Mastromarino, Enzo Grossi, Amalia Gastaldelli, Maria Aurora Morales, Filippo Muratori\",\"Journal\":\"Frontiers in Psychiatry\",\"Keywords\":\"adaptive functioning, autism spectrum disorders, gastrointestinal symptoms, inflammatory biomarkers, microbiota-gut-brain axis, probiotics, sensory processing\",\"URL\":\"https:\\\/\\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\\/pubmed\\\/33101079\\\/\",\"Affiliations\":\"Department of Developmental Neuroscience, IRCCS Stella Maris Foundation, Pisa, Italy, Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Research Council, Pisa, Italy, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy, Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy, Department of Autism Research, Villa Santa Maria Institute, Tavernerio, Italy\",\"Treatment name\":\"Probiotics (visbiome\\\/vivomixx)\",\"Liquid available\":null,\"ODT available\":null,\"First Author\":\"Santocchi, Elisa\",\"DOI.1\":\"https:\\\/\\\/doi.org\\\/10.3389\\\/fpsyt.2020.550593\",\"Commercial Affiliation\":null,\"Date of publication\":\"September 2020\",\"Journal.1\":\"Frontiers in Psychiatry\",\"Study type\":\"RCT\",\"Duration\":\"6 months\",\"n=\":85,\"M:F ratio\":\"84% M\",\"Age range\\\/mean\":\"18-72 mo; mean: 4.2 y\",\"Medication\\\/Treatment Dose Range \":\"2 packets\\\/day in first month, then 1 packet\\\/day for the remainder\",\"Primary Outcome Area\":\"Core symptoms and GI symptoms\",\"Primary Outcome Measures\":\"ADOS-CSS\",\"Results: Primary measure\":\"No differences in ADOS-CSS.\",\"Secondary Outcome Area\":\"Adaptive functioning, social behaviors, severity of GI symptoms, restricted and repetitive behaviors\",\"Secondary Outcome Measures\":\"VABS-II; Total GSI; SCQ; RBS-R; CBCL 1, 5-5; PSI; Plasma levels of leptin, TNF-a, IL-6, PAI-1, and fecal calprotectin levels\",\"Results: Secondary Measures\":\"Greater improvement in GI symptoms, adaptive functioning, and sensory profiles with probiotic supplementation. \",\"Tolerability\\\/Side Effects\":null,\"Safety\":null,\"Drop Out Rate\":null,\"Race\\\/Ethnicity Percentages \":null,\"Notes\":null,\"Sequence Generation (selection bias)\":\"Low risk - Computer generated randomization\",\"Allocation Concealment (selection bias)\":\"Low risk - Placebo and probiotic packaging and organoleptic characteristics were identical.

National Institutes of Health-sponsored randomized controlled trial. Six academic centers, including Mount Sinai School of Medicine, North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, University of California at Los Angeles, Yale University, and Dartmouth Medical School. One hundred forty-nine volunteers 5 to 17 years old (mean [SD] age, 9.4 [3.1] years) were randomized to receive citalopram (n = 73) or placebo (n = 76). Participants had autistic spectrum disorders, Asperger disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified; had illness severity ratings of at least moderate on the Clinical Global Impressions, Severity of Illness Scale; and scored at least moderate on compulsive behaviors measured with the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scales modified for pervasive developmental disorders. Twelve weeks of citalopram hydrobromide (10 mg\\\/5 mL) or placebo. The mean (SD) maximum dosage of citalopram hydrobromide was 16.5 (6.5) mg\\\/d by mouth (maximum, 20 mg\\\/d). Positive response was defined by a score of much improved or very much improved on the Clinical Global Impressions, Improvement subscale. An important secondary outcome was the score on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scales modified for pervasive developmental disorders. Adverse events were systematically elicited using the Safety Monitoring Uniform Report Form. There was no significant difference in the rate of positive response on the Clinical Global Impressions, Improvement subscale between the citalopram-treated group (32.9%) and the placebo group (34.2%) (relative risk, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.61-1.51; P > .99).

Citalopram use was significantly more likely to be associated with adverse events, particularly increased energy level, impulsiveness, decreased concentration, hyperactivity, stereotypy, diarrhea, insomnia, and dry skin or pruritus.

The sample comprised 24 children (19 boys; 5 girls) who met American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed. (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) on the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), and had significant symptoms of attention-deficit\\\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This sample consisted of elementary school-age, community-based children (mean chronological age=8.8 years, SD=1.7; mean intelligence quotient [IQ]=85; SD=16.8). Effects of four dose levels of MPH on parent and teacher behavioral ratings were investigated using a within-subject, crossover, placebo-controlled design. MPH treatment was associated with significant declines in hyperactive and impulsive behavior at both home and school.

Further, there are no effective, neuroscience-based treatments to address this impairing feature of ASD. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has demonstrated promise in addressing EF deficits in adult neuropsychiatric disorders. This article will outline the design of a novel randomized-controlled trial of bilateral, 20\\u2009Hz, rTMS applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for treatment of EF deficits in ASD that is currently ongoing. We describe prior therapeutic rTMS research for ASD and prior rTMS trials targeting EFs in adult neuropsychiatric disorders. A neurophysiological rationale for rTMS treatment of EF deficits in ASD is presented. An ongoing protocol will enroll participants aged 16-35 with ASD and no intellectual disability. Psychotropic medications will be continued during the 4-week trial of active 20\\u2009Hz versus sham rTMS applied to the DLPFC. Twenty, active treatment sessions consisting of 25 stimulation trains at a 90% motor threshold will be administered. The primary outcome measure is the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) spatial working memory task.

Further, there are no effective, neuroscience-based treatments to address this impairing feature of ASD. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has demonstrated promise in addressing EF deficits in adult neuropsychiatric disorders. This article will outline the design of a novel randomized-controlled trial of bilateral, 20\\u2009Hz, rTMS applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for treatment of EF deficits in ASD that is currently ongoing. We describe prior therapeutic rTMS research for ASD and prior rTMS trials targeting EFs in adult neuropsychiatric disorders. A neurophysiological rationale for rTMS treatment of EF deficits in ASD is presented. An ongoing protocol will enroll participants aged 16-35 with ASD and no intellectual disability. Psychotropic medications will be continued during the 4-week trial of active 20\\u2009Hz versus sham rTMS applied to the DLPFC. Twenty, active treatment sessions consisting of 25 stimulation trains at a 90% motor threshold will be administered. The primary outcome measure is the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) spatial working memory task. At present, recruitment, enrollment, and treatment within the described clinical trial are ongoing. EF deficits are common and impairing symptoms of ASD. There are no evidence-based treatments for EF deficits in ASD.

Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design, we tested the efficacy and tolerability of 4-wk intranasal OXT treatment (24 International Units, twice daily) in 32 children with ASD, aged 6-12 y. When pretreatment neuropeptide measures were included in the statistical model, OXT compared with placebo treatment significantly enhanced social abilities in children with ASD [as measured by the trial's primary outcome measure, the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS)]. Importantly, pretreatment blood OXT concentrations also predicted treatment response, such that individuals with the lowest pretreatment OXT concentrations showed the greatest social improvement. OXT was well tolerated, and its effects were specific to social functioning, with no observed decrease in repetitive behaviors or anxiety. Finally, as with many trials, some placebo-treated participants showed improvement on the SRS. This enhanced social functioning was mirrored by a posttreatment increase in their blood OXT concentrations, suggesting that increased endogenous OXT secretion may underlie this improvement.

In this randomized, parallel-group, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in Japan, 106 ASD individuals (18-48 y.o.) were enrolled between Jan 2015 and March 2016.

Since oxytocin reduced the primary endpoint, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) reciprocity, (from 8.5 to 7.7; P\\u2009<\\u2009.001) but placebo also reduced the score (8.3 to 7.2; P\\u2009<\\u2009.001), no between-group difference was found (effect size -0.08; 95% CI, -0.46 to 0.31; P\\u2009=\\u2009.69); however, plasma oxytocin was only elevated from baseline to endpoint in the oxytocin-group compared with the placebo-group (effect size -1.12; -1.53 to -0.70; P\\u2009<\\u2009.0001).

In addition, the duration of gaze fixation on socially relevant regions, another secondary endpoint, was increased by oxytocin (41.2 to 52.3; P\\u2009=\\u2009.03) compared with placebo (45.7 to 40.4; P\\u2009=\\u2009.25) (effect size 0.55; 0.10 to 1.0; P\\u2009=\\u2009.018).

To determine the efficacy of fluoxetine for reducing the frequency and severity of obsessive-compulsive behaviors in autism spectrum disorders. Multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Participants aged 7.5-18 years with autism spectrum disorders and a total score of 6 or higher on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, modified for pervasive developmental disorder (CYBOCS-PDD) were recruited from 3 tertiary health centers across Australia. Enrollment began November 2010 and ended April 2017. Follow-up ended August 2017. Participants were randomized to receive fluoxetine (n\\u2009=\\u200975) or placebo (n\\u2009=\\u200971). Study medication was commenced at 4 or 8 mg\\\/d for the first week, depending on weight, and then titrated to a maximum dose of 20 or 30 mg\\\/d over 4 weeks. Treatment duration was 16 weeks. The primary outcome was the total score on the CYBOCS-PDD (scores range from 0-20; higher scores indicate higher levels of maladaptive behaviors; minimal clinically important difference, 2 points) at 16 weeks postrandomization, analyzed with a linear regression model adjusted for stratification factors (site, age at baseline, and intellectual disability), with an additional prespecified model that included additional adjustment for baseline score, sex, communication level, and imbalanced baseline and demographic variables. Among the 146 participants who were randomized (85% males; mean age, 11.2 years), 109 completed the trial; 31 in the fluoxetine group and 21 in the placebo group dropped out or did not complete treatment. The mean CYBOCS-PDD score from baseline to 16 weeks decreased in the fluoxetine group from 12.80 to 9.02 points (3.72-point decrease; 95% CI, -4.85 to -2.60) and in the placebo group from 13.13 to 10.89 points (2.53-point decrease; 95% CI, -3.86 to -1.19).

To determine the efficacy of fluoxetine for reducing the frequency and severity of obsessive-compulsive behaviors in autism spectrum disorders. Multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Participants aged 7.5-18 years with autism spectrum disorders and a total score of 6 or higher on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, modified for pervasive developmental disorder (CYBOCS-PDD) were recruited from 3 tertiary health centers across Australia. Enrollment began November 2010 and ended April 2017. Follow-up ended August 2017. Participants were randomized to receive fluoxetine (n\\u2009=\\u200975) or placebo (n\\u2009=\\u200971). Study medication was commenced at 4 or 8 mg\\\/d for the first week, depending on weight, and then titrated to a maximum dose of 20 or 30 mg\\\/d over 4 weeks. Treatment duration was 16 weeks. The primary outcome was the total score on the CYBOCS-PDD (scores range from 0-20; higher scores indicate higher levels of maladaptive behaviors; minimal clinically important difference, 2 points) at 16 weeks postrandomization, analyzed with a linear regression model adjusted for stratification factors (site, age at baseline, and intellectual disability), with an additional prespecified model that included additional adjustment for baseline score, sex, communication level, and imbalanced baseline and demographic variables. Among the 146 participants who were randomized (85% males; mean age, 11.2 years), 109 completed the trial; 31 in the fluoxetine group and 21 in the placebo group dropped out or did not complete treatment. The mean CYBOCS-PDD score from baseline to 16 weeks decreased in the fluoxetine group from 12.80 to 9.02 points (3.72-point decrease; 95% CI, -4.85 to -2.60) and in the placebo group from 13.13 to 10.89 points (2.53-point decrease; 95% CI, -3.86 to -1.19).

However, the clinical significance remains uncertain, and future multi-center clinical trials are required to replicate these findings and confirm the clinical significance using a variety of outcome measures.\",\"Authors\":\"Dai Yuan, Zhang Lingli, Yu Juehua, Zhou Xin, He Hua, Ji Yiting, Wang Kai, Du Xiujuan, Liu Xin, Tang Yun, Deng Shining, Langley Christelle, Li Wei-Guang, Zhang Jun, Feng Jianfeng, Sahakian Barbara J, Luo Qiang, Li Fei\",\"Journal\":\"Science bulletin\",\"Keywords\":\"Humans, Child, Child, Preschool, Bumetanide, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Glutamic Acid, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid\",\"URL\":\"https:\\\/\\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\\/pubmed\\\/36654288\",\"Affiliations\":\"Department of Developmental and Behavioural Pediatric & Child Primary Care, Brain and Behavioural Research Unit of Shanghai Institute for Pediatric Research and MOE-Shanghai Key Laboratory for Children's Environmental Health, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200092, China.

Both biochemical and clinical outcomes were examined. Biochemically, FEN led to an increase in dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and decreases in whole-blood serotonin (5-HT), plasma norepinephrine (NE), and plasma 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG). The decrease in whole-blood 5-HT was seen only during treatment with FEN. However, NE levels did not return to baseline as long as 8 weeks after the first FEN treatment period. Increases in DOPAC were greater during the second FEN treatment period than the first. Persistent changes in catecholamine regulation may be related to previously reported long-term effects on central nervous system 5-HT after FEN.

Abnormal social and affectual responses also decreased, but this was not directly related to FEN treatment. Effects on cognition were equivocal.
