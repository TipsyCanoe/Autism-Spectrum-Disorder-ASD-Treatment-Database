{"Prompt":"The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of the anticonvulsant levetiracetam in the treatment of children with autism. A previous open-label study in autistic children treated with levetiracetam demonstrated effectiveness in hyperactivity, impulsivity\/aggression, and mood lability. Twenty patients with autism ranging from 5 to 17 years of age were entered into a 10-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of levetiracetam versus placebo. The mean maximum dosage for levetiracetam was 862.50+\/-279.19 mg\/day. We evaluated global improvement of autism with the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) Scale and aggression and affective instability with the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) parent and teacher ratings. We measured repetitive behaviors using the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) score and impulsivity and hyperactivity with the Conners' Rating Scale-Revised: Long Version for parent and teacher. No significant difference was found between levetiracetam and placebo groups comparing the change in CGI-I (t=0.350, d.f.=13.621, P=0.765), nor on change in ABC, CY-BOCS or Conners' scales. These findings suggest that levetiracetam does not improve behavioral disturbances of autism, but are limited by the small sample size and lack of stratification of the autistic sample at baseline.","Response":"{\"Treatment name\":\"Levetiracetam\",\"Study type\":\"Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled \",\"Duration\":\"10 weeks \",\"n=\":20,\"M:F ratio\":\"17 M: 3 F\",\"Age range\\\/mean\":\"5-17 y \",\"Medication\\\/Treatment Dose Range \":\"20-30 mg\\\/kg\\\/d\",\"Primary Outcome Area\":\"Global improvement\",\"Primary Outcome Measures\":\"CGI-I\",\"Results: Primary measure\":\"No significant improvement.\",\"Secondary Outcome Area\":\"Aggression, affective instability, repetitive behaviors, impulsivity, and hyperactivity\",\"Secondary Outcome Measures\":\"ABC parent and teacher ratings; CY-BOCS; Conners' Rating Scale-Revised: Long version for parent and teacher\",\"Results: Secondary Measures\":\"No significant change in any secondary measures.\",\"Tolerability\\\/Side Effects\":null,\"Safety\":null,\"Drop Out Rate\":null,\"Race\\\/Ethnicity Percentages \":null}"}
{"Prompt":"OBJECTIVE: Hyperactivity, impulsiveness, and distractibility are common problems in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Extended-release guanfacine is approved for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder but not well studied in ASD. METHOD: In a multisite, randomized clinical trial, extended-release guanfacine was compared with placebo in children with ASD accompanied by hyperactivity, impulsiveness, and distractibility. RESULTS: Sixty-two subjects (boys, N=53; girls, N=9; mean age=8.5 years [SD=2.25]) were randomly assigned to guanfacine (N=30) or placebo (N=32) for 8 weeks. The guanfacine group showed a 43.6% decline in scores on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-hyperactivity subscale (least squares mean from 34.2 to 19.3) compared with a 13.2% decrease in the placebo group (least squares mean from 34.2 to 29.7; effect size=1.67). The rate of positive response (much improved or very much improved on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale) was 50% (15 of 30) for guanfacine compared with 9.4% (3 of 32) for placebo. A brief cognitive battery tapping working memory and motor planning showed no group differences before or after 8 weeks of treatment. The modal dose of guanfacine at week 8 was 3 mg\/day (range: 1-4 mg\/day), and the modal dose was 3 mg\/day (range: 2-4 mg\/day) for placebo. Four guanfacine-treated subjects (13.3%) and four placebo subjects (12.5%) exited the study before week 8. The most common adverse events included drowsiness, fatigue, and decreased appetite. There were no significant changes on ECG in either group. For subjects in the guanfacine group, blood pressure declined in the first 4 weeks, with return nearly to baseline by endpoint (week 8). Pulse rate showed a similar pattern but remained lower than baseline at endpoint.

{"Prompt":"IMPORTANCE: Atypical antipsychotic medications are indicated for the treatment of irritability and agitation symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Unfortunately, these medications are associated with weight gain and metabolic complications that are especially troubling in children and with long-term use. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of metformin for weight gain associated with atypical antipsychotic medications in children and adolescents with ASD (defined in the protocol as DSM-IV diagnosis of autistic disorder, Asperger disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified), aged 6 to 17 years. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial was conducted at 4 centers in Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Columbus, Ohio; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Nashville, Tennessee. In all, 209 potential participants were screened by telephone, 69 individuals provided consent, and 61 participants were randomized to receive metformin or placebo between April 26, 2013, and June 24, 2015. INTERVENTIONS: Metformin or matching placebo titrated up to 500 mg twice daily for children aged 6 to 9 years and 850 mg twice daily for those 10 to 17 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was change in body mass index (BMI) z score during 16 weeks of treatment. Secondary outcomes included changes in additional body composition and metabolic variables. Safety, tolerability, and efficacy analyses all used a modified intent-to-treat sample comprising all participants who received at least 1 dose of medication. RESULTS: Of the 61 randomized participants, 60 participants initiated treatment (45 [75%] male; mean [SD] age, 12.8 [2.7] years). Metformin reduced BMI z scores from baseline to week 16 significantly more than placebo (difference in 16-week change scores vs placebo, -0.10 [95% CI, -0.16 to -0.04]; P\u2009=\u2009.003). Statistically significant improvements were also noted in secondary body composition measures (raw BMI, -0.95 [95% CI, -1.46 to -0.45] and raw weight, -2.73 [95% CI, -4.04 to -1.43]) but not in metabolic variables. Overall, metformin was well tolerated. Five participants in the metformin group discontinued treatment owing to adverse events (agitation, 4; sedation, 1). Participants receiving metformin vs placebo experienced gastrointestinal adverse events during a significantly higher percentage of treatment days (25.1% vs 6.8%; P\u2009=\u2009.005).

{"Prompt":"Increasing evidence suggests that the function of the GABAergic system is abnormally low in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Baclofen, which functions as a selective agonist for GABA(B) receptors, does appear promising for the treatment of ASD. We conducted a 10-week randomized-controlled study aimed at evaluating the potential of baclofen as an adjuvant therapy to enhance the effect of risperidone in children with ASD. Sixty-four children (3-12 years) with moderate-to-severe irritability symptoms of ASD were included. We used the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Edition (ABC-C) for the outcome measures on each of the follow-up visits (weeks 0, 5, and 10).

{"Prompt":"The social impairments of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have a major impact on quality of life, yet there are no medications that effectively treat these core social behavior deficits. Preclinical research suggests that arginine vasopressin (AVP), a neuropeptide involved in promoting mammalian social behaviors, may be a possible treatment for ASD. Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel study design, we tested the efficacy and tolerability of a 4-week intranasal AVP daily treatment in 30 children with ASD. AVP-treated participants aged 6 to 9.5 years received the maximum daily target dose of 24 International Units (IU); participants aged 9.6 to 12.9 years received the maximum daily target dose of 32 IU. Intranasal AVP treatment compared to placebo enhanced social abilities as assessed by change from baseline in this phase 2 trial's primary outcome measure, the Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd Edition total score (SRS-2 T score; F (1,20) = 9.853; P = 0.0052; \u03b7(p) (2) = 33.0%; Cohen's d = 1.40). AVP treatment also diminished anxiety symptoms and some repetitive behaviors. Most of these findings were more pronounced when we accounted for pretreatment AVP concentrations in blood. AVP was well tolerated with minimal side effects. No AVP-treated participants dropped out of the trial, and there were no differences in the rate of adverse events reported between treatment conditions. Last, no changes from baseline were observed in vital signs, electrocardiogram tracings, height and body weight, or clinical chemistry measurements after 4 weeks of AVP treatment.

{"Prompt":"Objective: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like sertraline have been shown in observational studies and anecdotal reports to improve language development in young children with fragile X syndrome (FXS). A previous controlled trial of sertraline in young children with FXS found significant improvement in expressive language development as measured by the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) among those with comorbid autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in post hoc analysis, prompting the authors to probe whether sertraline is also indicated in nonsyndromic ASD. Methods: The authors evaluated the efficacy of 6 months of treatment with low-dose sertraline in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 58 children with ASD aged 24 to 72 months. Results: 179 subjects were screened for eligibility, and 58 were randomized to sertraline (32) or placebo (26). Eight subjects from the sertraline arm and five from the placebo arm discontinued. Intent-to-treat analysis showed no significant difference from placebo on the primary outcomes (MSEL expressive language raw score and age equivalent combined score) or secondary outcomes. Sertraline was well tolerated, with no difference in side effects between sertraline and placebo groups. No serious adverse events possibly related to study treatment occurred.

The primary outcomes are Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), and the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R). We found that children with ASD can tolerate three-week tDCS treatment with no serious adverse events detected. A within-group comparison showed that real tDCS, but not sham tDCS, can significantly reduce the scores of CARS, Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ), and general impressions in CARS (15th item).

{"Prompt":"The microbiota-gut-brain axis has been recently recognized as a key modulator of neuropsychiatric health. In this framework, probiotics (recently named \"psychobiotics\") may modulate brain activity and function, possibly improving the behavioral profiles of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We evaluated the effects of probiotics on autism in a double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 85 preschoolers with ASD (mean age, 4.2 years; 84% boys). Participants were randomly assigned to probiotics (De Simone Formulation) (n=42) or placebo (n=43) for six months. Sixty-three (74%) children completed the trial. No differences between groups were detected on the primary outcome measure, the Total Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule - Calibrated Severity Score (ADOS-CSS). An exploratory secondary analysis on subgroups of children with or without Gastrointestinal Symptoms (GI group, n= 30; NGI group, n=55) revealed in the NGI group treated with probiotics a significant decline in ADOS scores as compared to that in the placebo group, with a mean reduction of 0.81 in Total ADOS CSS and of 1.14 in Social-Affect ADOS CSS over six months. In the GI group treated with probiotics we found greater improvements in some GI symptoms, adaptive functioning, and sensory profiles than in the GI group treated with placebo. These results suggest potentially positive effects of probiotics on core autism symptoms in a subset of ASD children independent of the specific intermediation of the probiotic effect on GI symptoms.

{"Prompt":"BACKGROUND: Endocannabinoid dysfunction in animal models of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and accumulating, albeit anecdotal, evidence for efficacy in humans motivated this placebo-controlled double-blind comparison of two oral cannabinoid solutions in 150 participants (age 5-21 years) with ASD. METHODS: We tested (1) BOL-DP-O-01-W, a whole-plant cannabis extract containing cannabidiol and \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol at a 20:1 ratio and (2) BOL-DP-O-01, purified cannabidiol and \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol at the same ratio. Participants (N\u2009=\u2009150) received either placebo or cannabinoids for 12-weeks (testing efficacy) followed by a 4-week washout and predetermined cross-over for another 12 weeks to further assess tolerability. Registered primary efficacy outcome measures were improvement in behavioral problems (differences between whole-plant extract and placebo) on the Home Situation Questionnaire-ASD (HSQ-ASD) and the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale with disruptive behavior anchor points (CGI-I). Secondary measures were Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2) and Autism Parenting Stress Index (APSI). RESULTS: Changes in Total Scores of HSQ-ASD (primary-outcome) and APSI (secondary-outcome) did not differ among groups. Disruptive behavior on the CGI-I (co-primary outcome) was either much or very much improved in 49% on whole-plant extract (n\u2009=\u200945) versus 21% on placebo (n\u2009=\u200947; p\u2009=\u20090.005). Median SRS Total Score (secondary-outcome) improved by 14.9 on whole-plant extract (n\u2009=\u200934) versus 3.6 points after placebo (n\u2009=\u200936); p\u2009=\u20090.009). There were no treatment-related serious adverse events. Common adverse events included somnolence and decreased appetite, reported for 28% and 25% on whole-plant extract, respectively (n\u2009=\u200995); 23% and 21% on pure-cannabinoids (n\u2009=\u200993), and 8% and 15% on placebo (n\u2009=\u200994). Limitations Lack of pharmacokinetic data and a wide range of ages and functional levels among participants warrant caution when interpreting the results. CONCLUSIONS: This interventional study provides evidence that BOL-DP-O-01-W and BOL-DP-O-01, administrated for 3 months, are well tolerated.

Twenty-three children ages 6-12 years old with ASD were randomized to memantine or placebo. Primary outcomes included measures of apraxia and expressive language with evaluations at midpoint (week 12) and endpoint (week 24). Secondary outcomes included memory and adaptive behavior measures. Exploratory outcomes included changes in overall cognitive functioning and behavior (e.g., Aberrant Behavior Checklist). Results: Results suggest that memantine was well-tolerated. Dropout rates were high across groups with only 14 participants completing the 6-month trial. Memantine was not associated with improvements in apraxia and expressive language.

{"Prompt":"Thirteen children (ages 5.6 to 11.2 years) with autism and symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of methylphenidate (0.3 and 0.6 mg\/kg per dose). Eight subjects responded positively, based upon a minimum 50% decrease on the Conners Hyperactivity Index. Ratings of stereotypy and inappropriate speech, which are often associated with autistic core features, also decreased. However, no changes were found on the Child Autism Rating Scale, a global assessment of autistic symptomotology.

{"Prompt":"Repetitive behaviors are a core symptom domain in autism that has been linked to alterations in the serotonin system. While the selective serotonin-receptive inhibitor fluvoxamine has been shown to be effective in adults with autism, as yet no published placebo controlled trials with these agents document safety and efficacy in children with autism. This study examines the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor liquid fluoxetine in the treatment of repetitive behaviors in childhood and adolescent autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). In total, 45 child or adolescent patients with ASD were randomized into two acute 8-week phases in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study of liquid fluoxetine. Study design included two randomized 8-week fluoxetine and placebo phases separated by a 4-week washout phase. Outcome measures included measures of repetitive behaviors and global improvement. Low-dose liquid fluoxetine (mean final dose: 9.9+\/-4.35 mg\/day) was superior to placebo in the treatment of repetitive behaviors by CY-BOCS compulsion scale. The effect size was in the moderate to large range, and the doses used were low. Liquid fluoxetine was only slightly, and not significantly, superior to placebo on CGI autism score partially due to a phase order effect. However, fluoxetine was marginally superior to placebo on a composite measure of global effectiveness. Liquid fluoxetine did not significantly differ from placebo on treatment emergent side effects. Liquid fluoxetine in low doses is more effective than placebo in the treatment of repetitive behaviors in childhood autism.

One hundred forty-nine volunteers 5 to 17 years old (mean [SD] age, 9.4 [3.1] years) were randomized to receive citalopram (n = 73) or placebo (n = 76). Participants had autistic spectrum disorders, Asperger disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified; had illness severity ratings of at least moderate on the Clinical Global Impressions, Severity of Illness Scale; and scored at least moderate on compulsive behaviors measured with the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scales modified for pervasive developmental disorders. Twelve weeks of citalopram hydrobromide (10 mg\/5 mL) or placebo. The mean (SD) maximum dosage of citalopram hydrobromide was 16.5 (6.5) mg\/d by mouth (maximum, 20 mg\/d).

Dosage followed a fixed schedule, starting at 10 mg\/day and increasing as tolerated up to 80 mg\/day. Repetitive behaviors were measured with the compulsion subscale of the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale; the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) improvement scale was used to rate improvement in obsessive-compulsive symptoms and overall severity. There was a significant treatment-by-time interaction indicating a significantly greater reduction in repetitive behaviors across time for fluoxetine than for placebo. With overall response defined as a CGI global improvement score of 2 or less, there were significantly more responders at week 12 in the fluoxetine group than in the placebo group. The risk ratio was 1.5 for CGI global improvement (responders: fluoxetine, 35%; placebo, 0%) and 1.8 for CGI-rated improvement in obsessive-compulsive symptoms (responders: fluoxetine, 50%; placebo, 8%). Only mild and moderate side effects were observed. Fluoxetine treatment, compared to placebo, resulted in significantly greater improvement in repetitive behaviors, according to both the Yale-Brown compulsion subscale and CGI rating of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, as well as on the CGI overall improvement rating. Fluoxetine appeared to be well tolerated.

{"Prompt":"An imbalance in the excitatory\/inhibitory systems with abnormalities in the glutamatergic pathways has been implicated in the pathophysiology of autism. Furthermore, chronic redox imbalance was also recently linked to this disorder. The goal of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility of using oral N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a glutamatergic modulator and an antioxidant, in the treatment of behavioral disturbance in children with autism. This was a 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of NAC in children with autistic disorder. Subjects randomized to NAC were initiated at 900 mg daily for 4 weeks, then 900 mg twice daily for 4 weeks and 900 mg three times daily for 4 weeks. The primary behavioral measure (Aberrant Behavior Checklist [ABC] irritability subscale) and safety measures were performed at baseline and 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Secondary measures included the ABC stereotypy subscale, Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised, and Social Responsiveness Scale. Thirty-three subjects (31 male subjects, 2 female subjects; aged 3.2-10.7 years) were randomized in the study. Follow-up data was available on 14 subjects in the NAC group and 15 in the placebo group. Oral NAC was well tolerated with limited side effects. Compared with placebo, NAC resulted in significant improvements on ABC irritability subscale (F = 6.80; p < .001; d = .96).

Mecamylamine, because of its safety record in children with other disorders, was chosen for this first exploration. Twenty children with autism spectrum disorder age 4-12 years were randomly assigned for 14 weeks to placebo (n=8) or mecamylamine (n=12) in ascending fixed doses: 0.5 mg\/day for 6 weeks, 2.5 mg for 2 weeks, then 5 mg\/day for 6 weeks. Improvement was rated by a blinded independent evaluator. Because of small sample, data analysis was descriptive. Eighteen participants (10 mecamylamine, 8 placebo) completed the study. All doses were well tolerated; the only side effect of note was constipation (50% compared with 25% of placebo group). Three children had clinically nonsignificant electrocardiographic QT prolongation. Both groups showed modest to moderate improvement, but differences between groups were negligible. On the primary outcome measure, the Ohio Autism Clinical Impressions Scale, 90% of the active treatment group showed improvement at some point (but only 40% sustained it), compared with 62% on placebo. Of the four in active treatment that sustained improvement, three had a maximum dose of 0.13-0.15 mg\/kg\/day, while those who regressed had doses \u22650.18 mg\/kg\/day. Graphed means suggested better outcome with lower mg\/kg and longer medication duration. Four parents spontaneously reported reduced hyperactivity and irritability and better verbalization and continued mecamylamine at their own expense.

{"Prompt":"Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated synapses and the oscillations they orchestrate are altered in autism. GABA-acting benzodiazepines exert in some patients with autism paradoxical effects, raising the possibility that like in epilepsies, GABA excites neurons because of elevated intracellular concentrations of chloride. Following a successful pilot study,(1) we have now performed a double-blind clinical trial using the diuretic, chloride-importer antagonist bumetanide that reduces intracellular chloride reinforcing GABAergic inhibition. Sixty children with autism or Asperger syndrome (3-11 years old) received for 3 months placebo or bumetanide (1 mg daily), followed by 1-month wash out. Determination of the severity of autism was made with video films at day 0 (D0) and D90 by blind, independent evaluators. Bumetanide reduced significantly the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) (D90-D0; P<0.004 treated vs placebo), Clinical Global Impressions (P<0.017 treated vs placebo) and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule values when the most severe cases (CARS values above the mean \u00b1 s.d.; n=9) were removed (Wilcoxon test: P-value=0.031; Student's t-test: P-value=0.017). Side effects were restricted to an occasional mild hypokalaemia (3.0-3.5 mM\u2009l(-1) K(+)) that was treated with supplemental potassium. In a companion study, chronic bumetanide treatment significantly improved accuracy in facial emotional labelling, and increased brain activation in areas involved in social and emotional perception (Hadjikhani et al., submitted).

{"Prompt":"A hyperglutamatergic state has been shown to play a possible role in the pathophysiology of autistic disorders. Riluzole is a glutamate-modulating agent with neuroprotective properties, which has been shown to have positive effects in many neuropsychiatric disorders. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of riluzole as an adjunctive to risperidone in the treatment of irritability in autistic children who were not optimally responding to previous medications. This was a 10-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial. The study enrolled male and female outpatients aged 5-12\u00a0years with a diagnosis of autistic disorder based on the DSM-IV-TR criteria and a score of \u226512 on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) irritability subscale who had discontinued other medications because of a lack of efficacy. Subjects received riluzole (titrated to 50 or 100\u00a0mg\/day based on bodyweight) or placebo in addition to risperidone (titrated up to 2 or 3\u00a0mg\/day based on bodyweight) for 10\u00a0weeks. Patients were assessed at baseline, week 5, and week 10. The primary outcome measure was the difference in the change in the ABC-C irritability subscale score from baseline to week 10 between the two groups. We also compared changes in other ABC-C subscale scores and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale scores between the two groups. Forty-nine patients were enrolled in the study, and forty children completed the trial (dropouts: placebo\u00a0=\u00a04, riluzole\u00a0=\u00a05). A significantly greater improvement in the study primary outcome (the ABC-C irritability subscale score) was achieved by the riluzole-treated children compared with the placebo group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Patients in the riluzole group also showed significantly greater improvement on the lethargy\/social withdrawal (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02), stereotypic behavior (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03), and hyperactivity\/non-compliance subscales (P\u00a0=\u00a00.005), but not on the inappropriate speech subscale (P\u00a0=\u00a00.20) than patients in the placebo group. Eleven patients in the riluzole group and five patients in the placebo group were classified as responders based on their CGI-I scores [\u03c7(2)(1)\u00a0=\u00a03.750, P\u00a0=\u00a00.05]. Children in the riluzole group experienced significantly more increases in their appetite and bodyweight than children in the placebo group by the end of the study. Riluzole add-on therapy shows several therapeutic outcomes, particularly for improving irritability, in children with autism. However, its add-on to risperidone also results in significantly increased appetite and weight gain.","Response":"{\"Treatment name\":\"Risperidone \",\"Study type\":\"Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled \",\"Duration\":\"8 weeks \",\"n=\":101,\"M:F ratio\":\"82 M: 19 F\",\"Age range\\\/mean\":\"5-17 y; Mean: 8.8 y\",\"Medication\\\/Treatment Dose Range \":\"0.5-3.5 mg\\\/d; Mean: 1.8 mg\\\/d\",\"Primary Outcome Area\":\"Irritability\",\"Primary Outcome Measures\":\"Abberant Behavior Checklist- Irritability subscale (ABC-I)\",\"Results: Primary measure\":\"Treatment with risperidone resulted in a higher rate of reduction in the irritability subscore than placebo. \",\"Secondary Outcome Area\":\"Global severity\",\"Secondary Outcome Measures\":\"Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I Score); VABS\",\"Results: Secondary Measures\":\"The rate of positive response was higher in the risperidone group than the placebo. \",\"Tolerability\\\/Side Effects\":\"Well tolerated.

{"Prompt":"To test the efficacy of venlafaxine at a dose of 18.75 mg\/day on the reduction of behavioral problems such as irritability and hyperactivity\/noncompliance in patients with intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Our secondary hypothesis was that the usual doses of zuclopenthixol and\/or clonazepam would decrease in the venlafaxine-treated group. In a randomized double-blind study, we compared six patients who received venlafaxine along with their usual treatment (zuclopenthixol and\/or clonazepam) with seven patients who received placebo plus usual care. Irritability, hyperactivity\/noncompliance, and overall clinical improvement were measured after 2 and 8 weeks, using validated clinical scales. Univariate analyses showed that the symptom of irritability improved in the entire sample (p = 0.023 after 2 weeks, p = 0.061 at study endpoint), although no difference was observed between the venlafaxine and placebo groups. No significant decrease in hyperactivity\/noncompliance was observed during the study. At the end of the study, global improvement was observed in 33% of participants treated with venlafaxine and in 71% of participants in the placebo group (p = 0.29). The study found that decreased cumulative doses of clonazepam and zuclopenthixol were required for the venlafaxine group. Multivariate analyses (principal component analyses) with at least three combinations of variables showed that the two populations could be clearly separated (p b 0.05). Moreover, in all cases, the venlafaxine population had lower values for the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Behavior Problems Inventory (BPI), and levels of urea with respect to the placebo group. In one case, a reduction in the dosage of clonazepam was also suggested. For an additional set of variables (ABC factor 2, BPI frequency of aggressive behaviors, hematic ammonia at Day 28, and zuclopenthixol and clonazepam intake), the separation between the two samples was statistically significant as was the Bartlett's test, but the Kaiser\u2013Meyer\u2013Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy was below the accepted threshold. This set of variables showed a reduction in the cumulative intake of both zuclopenthixol and clonazepam. Despite the small sample sizes, this study documented a statistically significant effect of venlafaxine. Moreover, we showed that lower doses of zuclopenthixol and clonazepam were needed in the venlafaxine group, although this difference was not statistically significant. This was confirmed by multivariate analyses, where this difference reached statistical significance when using a combination of variables involving zuclopenthixol.

Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design, we tested the efficacy and tolerability of 4-wk intranasal OXT treatment (24 International Units, twice daily) in 32 children with ASD, aged 6-12 y. When pretreatment neuropeptide measures were included in the statistical model, OXT compared with placebo treatment significantly enhanced social abilities in children with ASD [as measured by the trial's primary outcome measure, the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS)]. Importantly, pretreatment blood OXT concentrations also predicted treatment response, such that individuals with the lowest pretreatment OXT concentrations showed the greatest social improvement. OXT was well tolerated, and its effects were specific to social functioning, with no observed decrease in repetitive behaviors or anxiety. Finally, as with many trials, some placebo-treated participants showed improvement on the SRS. This enhanced social functioning was mirrored by a posttreatment increase in their blood OXT concentrations, suggesting that increased endogenous OXT secretion may underlie this improvement. These findings indicate that OXT treatment enhances social abilities in children with ASD and that individuals with pretreatment OXT signaling deficits may stand to benefit the most from OXT treatment.","Response":"{\"Treatment name\":\"Intranasal Oxytocin\",\"Study type\":\"RPCT - Parallel design\",\"Duration\":\"4 weeks\",\"n=\":32,\"M:F ratio\":\"27 M: 5 F\",\"Age range\\\/mean\":\"6-12 years, Mean: 8\\\/9 years\",\"Medication\\\/Treatment Dose Range \":\"24 IU BID\",\"Primary Outcome Area\":\"Social behaviors. \",\"Primary Outcome Measures\":\"Improvement in social abilities measured by the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS).\",\"Results: Primary measure\":\"Oxytocin significantly enhanced social abilities in participants. \\\"individuals with the lowest pretreatment OXT concentrations showed the greatest social improvement\\\"\",\"Secondary Outcome Area\":null,\"Secondary Outcome Measures\":\"Treatment efficacy in nonsocial symptom domains and OXT safety\\\/tolerability. \",\"Results: Secondary Measures\":null,\"Tolerability\\\/Side Effects\":\"Well tolerated with minimal side effects.

{"Prompt":"To assess the efficacy and safety of novel pediatric-appropriate, prolonged-release melatonin minitablets (PedPRM) versus placebo for insomnia in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with or without attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) comorbidity, and neurogenetic disorders (NGD). A total of 125 children and adolescents (2-17.5 years of age; 96.8% ASD, 3.2% Smith-Magenis syndrome [SMS]) whose sleep failed to improve on behavioral intervention alone were randomized (1:1 ratio), double-blind, to receive PedPRM (2 mg escalated to 5 mg) or placebo for 13 weeks. Sleep measures included the validated caregivers' Sleep and Nap Diary (SND) and Composite Sleep Disturbance Index (CSDI). The a priori primary endpoint was SND-reported total sleep time (TST) after 13 weeks of treatment. The study met the primary endpoint: after 13 weeks of double-blind treatment, participants slept on average 57.5 minutes longer at night with PedPRM compared to 9.14 minutes with placebo (adjusted mean\u00a0treatment difference PedPRM-placebo\u00a0-32.43 minutes; p\u00a0= .034). Sleep latency (SL) decreased by 39.6 minutes on\u00a0average with PedPRM and 12.5 minutes with placebo (adjusted mean treatment difference\u00a0-25.30 minutes; p\u00a0= .011) without causing earlier wakeup time. The rate of participants attaining clinically meaningful responses in TST and\/or SL was significantly higher with PedPRM than with placebo (68.9% versus 39.3% respectively; p\u00a0= .001) corresponding to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 3.38. Overall sleep disturbance (CSDI) tended to decrease. PedPRM was generally safe; somnolence was more commonly reported with PedPRM than placebo. PedPRM was efficacious and safe for treatment of insomnia in children and adolescents with ASD with\/without ADHD and NGD.

{"Prompt":"Sleep disorders are frequently reported in autistic patients. Evidences suggest that increased oxidative stress and reduced antioxidants may play a major role in the pathogenesis of these disorders. Carnosine acts as an antioxidant, antitoxic and neuroprotective agent. The aim of this trial study was to examine the effects of carnosine supplementation on the sleep disorders and severity of autism core symptoms in autistic patients. In this double-blind, randomized clinical trial, 43 autistic patients (31 boys and 12 girls; aged 4 to 16 years) were divided into two groups of carnosine and control that received 500 mg of carnosine and 500 mg of placebo per day for 2 months, respectively. Sleep disorders were measured using Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaires. Gilliam Autism Rating Scale 2 was used to assess the effects of carnosine supplementation on the autism severity. Carnosine supplementation did not change anthropometric indices (p > 0.05) and showed no effect on autism severity (p > 0.05), whereas it significantly reduced sleep duration (p = 0.04), parasomnias (p = 0.02) and total sleep disorders score by 7.59% (p = 0.006) when compared with the control group.

Since oxytocin reduced the primary endpoint, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) reciprocity, (from 8.5 to 7.7; P\u2009<\u2009.001) but placebo also reduced the score (8.3 to 7.2; P\u2009<\u2009.001), no between-group difference was found (effect size -0.08; 95% CI, -0.46 to 0.31; P\u2009=\u2009.69); however, plasma oxytocin was only elevated from baseline to endpoint in the oxytocin-group compared with the placebo-group (effect size -1.12; -1.53 to -0.70; P\u2009<\u2009.0001).

{"Prompt":"Different dietary approaches, such as gluten and casein free diets, or the use of probiotics and prebiotics have been suggested in autistic spectrum disorders in order to reduce gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances. GI symptoms are of particular interest in this population due to prevalence and correlation with the severity of behavioural traits. Nowadays, there is lack of strong evidence about the effect of dietary interventions on these problems, particularly prebiotics. Therefore, we assessed the impact of exclusion diets and a 6-week Bimuno\u00ae galactooligosaccharide (B-GOS\u00ae) prebiotic intervention in 30 autistic children. The results showed that children on exclusion diets reported significantly lower scores of abdominal pain and bowel movement, as well as lower abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. and Veillonellaceae family, but higher presence of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bacteroides spp. In addition, significant correlations were found between bacterial populations and faecal amino acids in this group, compared to children following an unrestricted diet. Following B-GOS\u00ae intervention, we observed improvements in anti-social behaviour, significant increase of Lachnospiraceae family, and significant changes in faecal and urine metabolites. To our knowledge, this is the first study where the effect of exclusion diets and prebiotics has been evaluated in autism, showing potential beneficial effects. A combined dietary approach resulted in significant changes in gut microbiota composition and metabolism suggesting that multiple interventions might be more relevant for the improvement of these aspects as well as psychological traits.

This randomized double-blind parallel-group study was conducted in three academic medical centers and a single private pediatric practice. Eighty children or adolescents (aged 6-17\u00a0yrs) with autistic disorder were enrolled, and 61 patients were randomized to the study drug. Of those patients, 51 completed the 10-week trial, and 31 completed an optional 12-week blinded extension phase. All patients were treated with 2\u00a0weeks of placebo before random assignment to receive aripiprazole (31 patients) or risperidone (30 patients) for 10\u00a0weeks. Sixteen placebo responders (20%) were excluded from further analysis. Drug dosing followed U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling, and weekly dosage adjustments were allowed until week 4; patients were then maintained on a fixed dose for 6 additional weeks. Safety, physical, and psychological assessments were recorded weekly or every 2 weeks. No significant differences in severity of illness between the aripiprazole and risperidone groups were noted at baseline. All patients significantly improved on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability subscale after 1 week and continued for the remaining 9\u00a0weeks and the extension phase. Improvement was greatest in the risperidone group at every assessment period and was statistically significantly better than that in the aripiprazole group at weeks 3 and 6 (p<0.05). No dose-limiting adverse events occurred during the dose-titration period. Mean weight gain in the aripiprazole group was significantly less than that in the risperidone group at week 4 (0.62 vs 1.38\u00a0kg, p=0.033) and week 10 (1.61 vs 3.31\u00a0kg, p<0.001), but the difference became nonsignificant for the 31 patients completing the 3-month extension phase (4.36 vs 5.55\u00a0kg, p=0.26).

The between-group mean difference at 16 weeks was -2.01 (95% CI, -3.77 to -0.25; P\u2009=\u2009.03) (adjusted for stratification factors), and in the prespecified model with further adjustment, it was -1.17 (95% CI, -3.01 to 0.67; P\u2009=\u2009.21). In this preliminary study of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders, treatment with fluoxetine compared with placebo resulted in significantly lower scores for obsessive-compulsive behaviors at 16 weeks. Interpretation is limited by the high dropout rate, null findings of prespecified analyses that accounted for potentially confounding factors and baseline imbalances, and CIs for the treatment effect that included the minimal clinically important difference. anzctr.org.au Identifier: ACTRN12608000173392.","Response":"{\"Treatment name\":\"Fluoxetine\",\"Study type\":\"Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled  - Multisite\",\"Duration\":\"16 weeks \",\"n=\":146,\"M:F ratio\":\"85% males; 15% females \",\"Age range\\\/mean\":\"Mean: 11.2 years\",\"Medication\\\/Treatment Dose Range \":\"4 or 8 mg\\\/d for the first week, titrated to max dose of 20 or 30 mg\\\/d\",\"Primary Outcome Area\":\"Obsessive-compulsive\\\/repetitive behaviors\",\"Primary Outcome Measures\":\".

{"Prompt":"The underlying pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been linked to immune dysregulation, oxidative stress and excitation-inhibition imbalance. Among associated symptoms of ASD, management of irritability has gained considerable attention as it complicates adjustment of ASD patients and thus necessitates its pharmacological treatment. Resveratrol is a plant phytoalexin, which has been demonstrated to have neuroprotective effects through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial was designed to assess the potential therapeutic effects of resveratrol plus risperidone on irritability of ASD patients. Sixty-two patients were assigned randomly into two groups of resveratrol and placebo. Both groups were treated with risperidone twice daily starting at a dose of 0.5\u00a0mg with a dose increase of 0.5\u00a0mg per week (for the first 3\u00a0weeks). Resveratrol dosage was 250\u00a0mg twice per day from the beginning of the study. Using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C), patients were assessed for ASD-related behavioural symptoms at baseline, week 5 and week 10. The frequency of adverse events was recorded using a checklist containing 25 possible side effects, including general, gastrointestinal, neurological and cardiovascular complications. Improvements in primary outcome measure (irritability) and three secondary outcome measures (lethargy\/social withdrawal, stereotypic behaviour and inappropriate speech subscales) in the resveratrol group were statistically similar to those in the placebo group. The repeated measures analysis showed no time\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0treatment interaction on these subscale scores. In contrast, patients in the resveratrol group showed greater decline in hyperactivity\/non-compliance score as a secondary outcome measure (mean difference [CI\u00a0=\u00a095%]\u00a0=\u00a04.51 [0.10-8.92], t\u00a0=\u00a02.04; P\u00a0=\u00a0.04), and repeated measures analysis showed significant effect for time\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0treatment effect on this subscale score (F\u00a0=\u00a03.81; df\u00a0=\u00a01.30; P\u00a0=\u00a0.043). There was no significant difference in number and severity of adverse events between the two groups. This clinical trial demonstrated no significant effect for adjunctive treatment with resveratrol on irritability of patients with ASD.

{"Prompt":"Propentofylline is a xanthine phosphodiesterase inhibitor and adenosine reuptake blocker with neuroprotective effects linked to anti-inflammatory and antiexcitatory properties. This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating the potential beneficial effects of propentofylline, as an adjunctive treatment with risperidone, on the severity and behavioral abnormalities of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A total of 48 children with ASD were randomly allocated into 2 groups of risperidone (initiating at 0.5 mg\/d) plus propentofylline (initiating at 300 mg\/d) and risperidone plus placebo. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) and Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) were used for the evaluation of ASD severity and behavioral disruptions at baseline, week 4, and week 10. Primary outcome measure of the study was ABC-C irritability subscale score, whereas CARS score along with other 4 subscales of ABC-C (lethargy\/social withdrawal, stereotypic behavior, hyperactivity\/noncompliance, and inappropriate speech subscales) were considered as secondary outcome measures. Results from the general linear model repeated measures analysis demonstrated significant time-treatment interaction on irritability subscale (F1.55 = 3.45; P = 0.048) and CARS (F1.41 = 4.08; P = 0.034) scores. Compared with the placebo group, children receiving propentofylline showed greater improvements in the CARS score (P = 0.037) from baseline to the study endpoint. Our results found no significant time-treatment effect on other subscales of ABC-C. Two trial groups were comparable based on the frequency of adverse effects.

{"Prompt":"Intranasal administration of the \"prosocial\" neuropeptide oxytocin is increasingly explored as a potential treatment for targeting the core characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, long-term follow-up studies, evaluating the possibility of long-lasting retention effects, are currently lacking. Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design, this pilot clinical trial explored the possibility of long-lasting behavioral effects of 4 weeks of intranasal oxytocin treatment (24 International Units once daily in the morning) in 40 adult men with ASD. To do so, self-report and informant-based questionnaires assessing core autism symptoms and characterizations of attachment were administered at baseline, immediately after 4 weeks of treatment (approximately 24 h after the last nasal spray administration), and at two follow-up sessions, 4 weeks and 1 year post-treatment. No treatment-specific effects were identified in the primary outcome assessing social symptoms (Social Responsiveness Scale, self- and informant-rated). In particular, with respect to self-reported social responsiveness, improvements were evident both in the oxytocin and in the placebo group, yielding no significant between-group difference (<i>p<\/i> = .37). Also informant-rated improvements in social responsiveness were not significantly larger in the oxytocin, compared to the placebo group (between-group difference: <i>p<\/i> = .19). Among the secondary outcome measures, treatment-specific improvements were identified in the Repetitive Behavior Scale and State Adult Attachment Measure, indicating reductions in self-reported repetitive behaviors (<i>p<\/i> = .04) and reduced feelings of avoidance toward others (<i>p<\/i> = .03) in the oxytocin group compared to the placebo group, up to 1 month and even 1 year post-treatment. Treatment-specific effects were also revealed in screenings of mood states (Profile of Mood States), indicating higher reports of \"vigor\" (feeling energetic, active, lively) in the oxytocin, compared to the placebo group (<i>p<\/i> = .03). While no treatment-specific improvements were evident in terms of core social symptoms, the current observations of long-term beneficial effects on repetitive behaviors and feelings of avoidance are promising and suggestive of a therapeutic potential of oxytocin treatment for ASD. However, given the exploratory nature of this pilot study, future studies are warranted to evaluate the long-term effects of OT administration further.

{"Prompt":"The purpose of this study was to conduct a 20-week controlled trial of lovastatin (10 to 40\u2009mg\/day) in youth with fragile X syndrome (FXS) ages 10 to 17\u2009years, combined with an open-label treatment of a parent-implemented language intervention (PILI), delivered via distance video teleconferencing to both treatment groups, lovastatin and placebo. A randomized, double-blind trial was conducted at one site in the Sacramento, California, metropolitan area. Fourteen participants were assigned to the lovastatin group; two participants terminated early from the study. Sixteen participants were assigned to the placebo group. Lovastatin or placebo was administered orally in a capsule form, starting at 10\u2009mg and increasing weekly or as tolerated by 10\u2009mg increments, up to a maximum dose of 40\u2009mg daily. A PILI was delivered to both groups for 12\u2009weeks, with 4 activities per week, through video teleconferencing by an American Speech-Language Association-certified Speech-Language Pathologist, in collaboration with a Board-Certified Behavior Analyst. Parents were taught to use a set of language facilitation strategies while interacting with their children during a shared storytelling activity. The main outcome measures included absolute change from baseline to final visit in the means for youth total number of story-related utterances, youth number of different word roots, and parent total number of story-related utterances. Significant increases in all primary outcome measures were observed in both treatment groups. Significant improvements were also observed in parent reports of the severity of spoken language and social impairments in both treatment groups. In all cases, the amount of change observed did not differ across the two treatment groups. Although gains in parental use of the PILI-targeted intervention strategies were observed in both treatment groups, parental use of the PILI strategies was correlated with youth gains in the placebo group and not in the lovastatin group. Participants in both groups demonstrated significant changes in the primary outcome measures.

We tested efficacy of bumetanide on core symptom domains using a single center, parallel-group, participant-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase-2 superiority trial in a tertiary hospital in the Netherlands. Unmedicated children aged 7 to 15 years with ASD and IQ \u226555 were block-randomized 1:1 to oral-solution bumetanide versus placebo, titrated to a maximum of 1.0 mg twice daily for 91 days (D91), followed by a 28-day wash-out period. The primary outcome was difference in Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2) total score at D91, analyzed by modified intention-to-treat with linear mixed models.

We conducted a 24-week, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial of intranasal oxytocin therapy in children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with autism spectrum disorder. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, with stratification according to age and verbal fluency, to receive oxytocin or placebo, administered intranasally, with a total target dose of 48 international units daily. The primary outcome was the least-squares mean change from baseline on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist modified Social Withdrawal subscale (ABC-mSW), which includes 13 items (scores range from 0 to 39, with higher scores indicating less social interaction). Secondary outcomes included two additional measures of social function and an abbreviated measure of IQ. Of the 355 children and adolescents who underwent screening, 290 were enrolled. A total of 146 participants were assigned to the oxytocin group and 144 to the placebo group; 139 and 138 participants, respectively, completed both the baseline and at least one postbaseline ABC-mSW assessments and were included in the modified intention-to-treat analyses. The least-squares mean change from baseline in the ABC-mSW score (primary outcome) was -3.7 in the oxytocin group and -3.5 in the placebo group (least-squares mean difference, -0.2; 95% confidence interval, -1.5 to 1.0; P\u2009=\u20090.61). Secondary outcomes generally did not differ between the trial groups. The incidence and severity of adverse events were similar in the two groups. This placebo-controlled trial of intranasal oxytocin therapy in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder showed no significant between-group differences in the least-squares mean change from baseline on measures of social or cognitive functioning over a period of 24 weeks.

{"Prompt":"This study was a 10-week double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial of mirtazapine for anxiety in youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Participants were ages 5 to 17 years with ASD and clinically significant anxiety (Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale [PARS] score \u226510). Thirty participants were randomized to mirtazapine (7.5-45\u2009mg\/day) or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. The co-primary outcome measures were the PARS and the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement subscale (CGI-I). Mirtazapine resulted in a statistically significant within group decrease in anxiety on the PARS (ES 1.76, p\u2009<\u20090.001). The improvement in PARS score for mirtazapine versus placebo was clinically meaningful but not statistically significant (ES\u2009=\u20090.63, p\u2009=\u20090.64). Forty-seven percent of participants assigned to mirtazapine (95% CI 22%: 74%) and 20% assigned to placebo (95% CI 2%: 60%) were rated \"much improved\" (CGI-I\u2009=\u20092) or \"very much improved\" (CGI-I\u2009=\u20091) for anxiety, p\u2009=\u20090.46. No statistically significant differences in mean 10-week changes between mirtazapine and placebo occurred on any outcome measure. There were no statistically significant differences in adverse effect frequency between mirtazapine and placebo. The results are consistent with mirtazapine's safety and tolerability and meet three of four pre-specified indicators of efficacy (statistically significant change in total PARS score for mirtazapine, numerically greater reduction in total PARS score for mirtazapine than placebo, numerically higher number of responders to mirtazapine than placebo, but not greater than 50% of participants receiving mirtazapine rated as responders). Implementation of a larger randomized controlled trial of mirtazapine for the treatment of anxiety in this population is supported.Clinical trial registration information: Mirtazapine Treatment of Anxiety in Children and Adolescents with Pervasive Developmental Disorders; https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov ; NCT01302964.","Response":"{\"Treatment name\":\"Mirtazapine\",\"Study type\":\"RCT\",\"Duration\":\"10 week\",\"n=\":30,\"M:F ratio\":null,\"Age range\\\/mean\":\"5-17\",\"Medication\\\/Treatment Dose Range \":\"7.5-45 mg\\\/d\",\"Primary Outcome Area\":\"Anxiety\",\"Primary Outcome Measures\":\"PARS; CGI-I\",\"Results: Primary measure\":\"Significant within group decrease in anxiety on PARS.

{"Prompt":"There are no approved medications for the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), socialization and communication difficulties. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of balovaptan, an oral selective vasopressin 1a receptor antagonist, compared with placebo in children and adolescents with ASD. The aV1ation study was a randomized, double-blind, 24-week, parallel-group, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial. Between November 22, 2016, and September 3, 2019, individuals were screened and randomly assigned to treatment groups. The primary efficacy analysis population comprised participants taking age-adjusted balovaptan equivalent to a 10-mg adult dose and participants from the concurrently randomized placebo group. This multicenter trial took place across 41 sites in the US. Participants were aged 5 to 17 years with diagnosed ASD and an IQ of 70 or greater. Data were analyzed from April 8 to November 16, 2020. Participants were randomly assigned to daily 4-mg or 10-mg adult-equivalent balovaptan or placebo, until the 4-mg group was discontinued. The primary end point was change from baseline on the Vineland-II two-domain composite (2DC; socialization and communication domains) score at week 24. Between November 2016 and September 2019, a total of 599 individuals were screened and 339 participants were randomly assigned to receive 4-mg balovaptan adult-equivalent dose (91 [26.8%]), 10-mg balovaptan adult-equivalent dose (126 [37.2%]), or placebo (122 [36.0%]). Primary analysis included 86 participants assigned to receive 10-mg balovaptan adult-equivalent dose and 81 assigned to receive placebo (mean [SD] age, 12.1 [3.4] years; 139 male participants [83.2%]). No statistically significant differences were observed between the balovaptan and placebo groups in change from baseline on the Vineland-II 2DC score at week 24 (difference in adjusted least-squares mean, -0.16; 90% CI, -2.56 to 2.23; P\u2009=\u2009.91). No improvements for balovaptan vs placebo were observed at week 24 for any secondary end points. Balovaptan was well tolerated with no emerging safety concerns. Similar proportions of participants reported adverse events (balovaptan, 66 of 86 [76.7%] vs placebo, 61 of 81 [75.3%]) and serious adverse events (balovaptan, 1 of 86 [1.2%] vs placebo, 4 of 81 [4.9%]). In this randomized clinical trial, balovaptan did not demonstrate efficacy in improvement of socialization and communication in this population with pediatric ASD. Balovaptan was well tolerated in children 5 years or older. Further development of robust, sensitive, and objective outcome measures may help to improve future studies in the assessment of therapies targeting communication and socialization in pediatric ASD.

{"Prompt":"With the current limited drug therapy for the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), we herein report a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy, safety, and potential neural mechanism of bumetanide in children with ASD aged 3-6\u00a0years old. A total of 120 children were enrolled into the study and randomly assigned to either 0.5\u00a0mg bumetanide or placebo. In the final sample, 119 children received at least one dose of bumetanide (59 children) or placebo (60 children) were included in the final analysis. The primary outcome was a reduction in the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) score, and the secondary outcomes were the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI) -Global Improvement (CGI-I) score at 3\u00a0months and the change from baseline to 3-month in the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to measure \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate neurotransmitter concentrations in the insular cortex (IC) before and after the treatment. As compared with the placebo, bumetanide treatment was significantly better in reducing the severity. No patient withdrew from the trial due to adverse events. The superiority of bumetanide to placebo in reducing insular GABA, measured using MRS, was demonstrated. The clinical improvement was associated with a decrease in insular GABA in the bumetanide group. In conclusion, this trial in a large group of young children with predominantly moderate and severe ASD demonstrated that bumetanide is safe and effective in improving the core symptoms of ASD. However, the clinical significance remains uncertain, and future multi-center clinical trials are required to replicate these findings and confirm the clinical significance using a variety of outcome measures.","Response":"{\"Treatment name\":\"Bumetanide\",\"Study type\":\"RCT\",\"Duration\":\"3 months\",\"n=\":119,\"M:F ratio\":\"19 F: 100 M\",\"Age range\\\/mean\":\"3-6 y; mean: 4.03-4.22 y\",\"Medication\\\/Treatment Dose Range \":\"0.5 mg BID\",\"Primary Outcome Area\":\"ASD Severity\",\"Primary Outcome Measures\":\"CARS\",\"Results: Primary measure\":\"Bumetanide treatment improved CARS scores. \",\"Secondary Outcome Area\":\"ASD severity\",\"Secondary Outcome Measures\":\"ADOS, SRS, and CGI-I; Exploratory: GABA and glutamate concentrations within the IC\",\"Results: Secondary Measures\":\"Bumetanide treatment was better at reducing insular GABA.

{"Prompt":"The use of psychostimulants in autistic disorder has not received extensive evaluation. Furthermore, their use for the symptomatic control of autistic disorder has been felt to be contraindicated. This study investigates the use of methylphenidate (MPH) for the treatment of selected symptoms of autistic disorder. Ten children, ages 7-11, with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of autistic disorder participated in a double-blind crossover study using placebo and two MPH doses (10 mg or 20 mg bid). Subjects showed modest but statistically significant improvement on MPH over placebo. No significant side effects including worsening stereotypic movements occurred on either dose.

{"Prompt":"Fifteen children with autism were treated with 60 mg d,l-fenfluramine (FEN) or placebo in a double-blind A-B-A protocol followed immediately by double-blind placebo-controlled crossover administration of FEN (total duration 62 weeks). Both biochemical and clinical outcomes were examined. Biochemically, FEN led to an increase in dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and decreases in whole-blood serotonin (5-HT), plasma norepinephrine (NE), and plasma 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG). The decrease in whole-blood 5-HT was seen only during treatment with FEN. However, NE levels did not return to baseline as long as 8 weeks after the first FEN treatment period. Increases in DOPAC were greater during the second FEN treatment period than the first. Persistent changes in catecholamine regulation may be related to previously reported long-term effects on central nervous system 5-HT after FEN. Clinically, FEN led to a modest decrease in parent, but not teacher, ratings of hyperactivity and to a small reduction in sensorimotor abnormalities. Abnormal social and affectual responses also decreased, but this was not directly related to FEN treatment. Effects on cognition were equivocal. Hyperserotonemic subjects did not differ from normoserotonemic subjects in clinical response. Overall, no significant advantage for the use of FEN could be established.","Response":"{\"Treatment name\":\"Fenfluramine\",\"Study type\":\"double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial\",\"Duration\":\"62 weeks\",\"n=\":15,\"M:F ratio\":null,\"Age range\\\/mean\":null,\"Medication\\\/Treatment Dose Range \":\"60 mg\\\/d\",\"Primary Outcome Area\":\"Neurochemical effects and behavior\",\"Primary Outcome Measures\":\"Ritvo-Freeman Real Life Rating Scale; neurochemical plasma levels \",\"Results: Primary measure\":\"No significant improvement in behavior.
