There is limited evidence of memantine showing benefit for paediatric neurodevelopmental phenotypes, but no randomized placebo-controlled trials in children with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial (Trial registration: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03779672), patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy received memantine and placebo, each for a 6-week period separated by a 2-week washout phase. Electroencephalography, seizure diary, patient caregivers' global impression, serum inflammatory markers and neuropsychological evaluation were performed at baseline and after each treatment phase. The primary outcome measure was classification as a 'responder', defined as ≥2 of: >50% seizure frequency reduction, electroencephalography improvement, caregiver clinical impression improvement or clear neuropsychological testing improvement. Thirty-one patients (13 females) enrolled. Two patients withdrew prior to initiating medication and two (twins) had to be removed from analysis. Of the remaining 27 patients, nine (33%) were classified as responders to memantine versus two (7%) in the placebo group (P < 0.02). Electroencephalography improvement was seen in eight patients on memantine compared to two on placebo (P < 0.04). Seizure improvement was observed in eight patients on memantine and two on placebo (P < 0.04). Caregivers reported overall clinical improvement in 10 patients on memantine compared to seven on placebo (not significant). Statistical analysis of neuropsychological evaluation suggested improvements in symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism. Memantine is a safe and effective treatment for children with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, having the potential to improve both seizure control and cognitive function.","Schiller Katharina, Berrahmoune Saoussen, Dassi Christelle, Corriveau Isabelle, Ayash Taghreed A, Osterman Bradley, Poulin Chantal, Shevell Michael I, Simard-Tremblay Elisabeth, Sébire Guillaume, Myers Kenneth A",Brain : a journal of neurology,"Female, Humans, Memantine, Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists, Cross-Over Studies, Treatment Outcome, Seizures, Epilepsy, Generalized, Double-Blind Method",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36256600,"Child Health and Human Development, Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC H4A 3J1, Canada.; Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreal, QC H3A 2B4, Canada.; Division of Neurology, Department of Pediatrics, Montreal Children's Hospital, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC H4A 3J1, Canada.; Department of Psychology, Montreal Children's Hospital, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC H4A 3J1, Canada."

Despite the effectiveness of serotonergic compounds in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, treatment-resistant symptoms remaining in 40 to 60 % of patients present a pressing clinical problem. There are currently no medications that effectively treat the core impairments of autism spectrum disorder. There is an urgent need for the development of conceptually novel pharmacological strategies. Agents targeting glutamate neurotransmission, such as memantine, represent promising candidates. This proof-of-concept clinical study will allow pilot-testing of memantine for both clinical effectiveness and tolerability/safety. Memantine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia in a number of countries. This 12-week study has an add-on, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled design of treatment with memantine, including an up-titration phase (forced flexible dose design, 5-15 mg/day), in patients aged 6-17 years and 9 months with obsessive-compulsive disorder or autism spectrum disorder. It is planned to include patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (N = 50) or autism spectrum disorder (N = 50) across four centres in three European countries. Patients will be randomly assigned to memantine or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Primary objectives are the investigation of the effectiveness of memantine in paediatric patients for improving symptoms of compulsivity (primary outcome measure: total score on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale) and to explore its tolerability and safety. Secondary objectives are to explore the effects of memantine at the level of structure, function and biochemistry of the fronto-striatal circuits, and to collect blood for genetic analyses and biomarkers. Tertiary objectives are to explore the role of new candidate genes and pathways for compulsivity by linking genes to clinical phenotypes, response to treatment, neurocognitive test performance, and key structural and functional neuroimaging measures of the fronto-striatal circuits and to explore biomarkers/proteomics for compulsivity traits. This study is part of the large, translational project TACTICS ( http://www.tactics-project.eu/ ) that is funded by the European Union and investigates the neural, genetic and molecular factors involved in the pathogenesis of compulsivity. Its results will provide clinically relevant solid information on potential new mechanisms and medication treatment in obsessive-compulsive and autism spectrum disorders.

In this study, the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist memantine (once-daily extended-release [ER]) were investigated in children with autism in a randomized, placebo-controlled, 12 week trial and a 48 week open-label extension. A total of 121 children 6-12 years of age with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed., Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR)-defined autistic disorder were randomized (1:1) to placebo or memantine ER for 12 weeks; 104 children entered the subsequent extension trial. Maximum memantine doses were determined by body weight and ranged from 3 to 15 mg/day. There was one serious adverse event (SAE) (affective disorder, with memantine) in the 12 week study and one SAE (lobar pneumonia) in the 48 week extension; both were deemed unrelated to treatment. Other AEs were considered mild or moderate and most were deemed not related to treatment. No clinically significant changes occurred in clinical laboratory values, vital signs, or electrocardiogram (ECG). There was no significant between-group difference on the primary efficacy outcome of caregiver/parent ratings on the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), although an improvement over baseline at Week 12 was observed in both groups. A trend for improvement at the end of the 48 week extension was observed. No improvements in the active group were observed on any of the secondary end-points, with one communication measure showing significant worsening with memantine compared with placebo (p = 0.02) after 12 weeks. This trial did not demonstrate clinical efficacy of memantine ER in autism; however, the tolerability and safety data were reassuring.

Cross-over effects of a dopamine agonist and an antagonist].,1992-01-01,"In infantile autism, the serotoninergic (5-HT) hypothesis is corroborated by biological dosages and therapeutic effects of fenfluramine which decrease blood serotonin. However other drugs, such as dopaminergic agonists or antagonists, have therapeutic effects. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that two dopaminergic (DA) drugs have a similar 5-HT effect underlying the therapeutic efficiency. We evaluated in a randomized, double-blind and cross-over study, the effects of a DA agonist (bromocriptine) and a DA antagonist (amisulpride) on platelet 5-HT in infantile autism. The prolactinemia, reflecting the DA action, has been also measured. Nine children, aged from 4 to 13 years, according to the DSM III for infantile autism, received either drug in a random order during four weeks with an in-between placebo period of six weeks. The dosages of platelet 5-HT and serum prolactin were carried out at the beginning and at the end of every phase of treatment (active or placebo) with radioenzymology and radioimmunoassay methods respectively. The principal results on serum prolactin show neither order x treatment interaction, nor order effect but a significant treatment effect (p < 0.01): amisulpride increases serum prolactin whereas bromocriptine decreases according to the usual data. About platelet 5-HT, there is neither order x treatment interaction, nor treatment effect but a significant order effect (p < 0.01). Both drugs increase platelet 5-HT in the first phase of treatment. This order effect could be explained by a remanent effect of amisulpride after 6 wash-out weeks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Dollfus S, Petit M, Launay J M, Callebert J, Boudou P, Dreux C, Ménard J F",L'Encephale,"Adolescent, Amisulpride, Antipsychotic Agents, Autistic Disorder, Blood Platelets, Bromocriptine, Child, Child, Preschool, Dopamine, Double-Blind Method, Female, Homovanillic Acid, Humans, Male, Prolactin, Serotonin, Sulpiride",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1364154,"CHS du Rouvray, Service Hospitalo-Universitaire, Sotteville-les-Rouen."

31042696,10.1038/S41386-019-0402-Z,Effects of MDMA on attention to positive social cues and pleasantness of affective touch.,2019-09-01,"The psychostimulant drug ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) reportedly produces distinctive feelings of empathy and closeness with others. MDMA increases social behavior in animal models and has shown promise in psychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). How it produces these prosocial effects is not known. This behavioral and psychophysiological study examined the effects of MDMA, compared with the prototypical stimulant methamphetamine (MA), on two measures of social behavior in healthy young adults: (i) responses to socially relevant, ""affective"" touch, and (ii) visual attention to emotional faces. Men and women (N = 36) attended four sessions in which they received MDMA (0.75 or 1.5 mg/kg), MA (20 mg), or a placebo in randomized order under double-blind conditions. Responses to experienced and observed affective touch (i.e., being touched or watching others being touched) were assessed using facial electromyography (EMG), a proxy of affective state. Responses to emotional faces were assessed using electrooculography (EOG) in a measure of attentional bias. Subjective ratings were also included. We hypothesized that MDMA, but not MA, would enhance the ratings of pleasantness and psychophysiological responses to affective touch and increase attentional bias toward positive facial expressions. Consistent with this, we found that MDMA, but not MA, selectively enhanced ratings of pleasantness of experienced affective touch. Neither drug altered the ratings of pleasantness of observed touch. On the EOG measure of attentional bias, MDMA, but not MA, increased attention toward happy faces. These results provide new evidence that MDMA can enhance the experience of positive social interactions; in this case, pleasantness of physical touch and attentional bias toward positive facial expressions. The findings are consistent with evidence that the prosocial effects are unique to MDMA relative to another stimulant. Understanding the behavioral and neurobiological processes underlying the distinctive social effects of MDMA is a key step to developing the drug for psychiatric disorders.","Bershad Anya K, Mayo Leah M, Van Hedger Kathryne, McGlone Francis, Walker Susannah C, de Wit Harriet",Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,"Adolescent, Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors, Adult, Affect, Attention, Attentional Bias, Cues, Double-Blind Method, Electromyography, Electrooculography, Facial Muscles, Female, Healthy Volunteers, Humans, Male, Methamphetamine, N-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, Pleasure, Social Behavior, Touch Perception, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042696,"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.; School of Natural Sciences and Psychology, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, UK.; Center for Social and Affective Neuroscience, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden.; Department of Clinical Neurological Sciences, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, UK.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA. hdew@uchicago.edu."

25818246,10.1016/J.Pnpbp.2015.03.011,MDMA-assisted therapy: A new treatment model for social anxiety in autistic adults.,2016-01-04,"The first study of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted therapy for the treatment of social anxiety in autistic adults commenced in the spring of 2014. The search for psychotherapeutic options for autistic individuals is imperative considering the lack of effective conventional treatments for mental health diagnoses that are common in this population. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) involving the administration of MDMA in clinical trials have been rare and non-life threatening. To date, MDMA has been administered to over 1133 individuals for research purposes without the occurrence of unexpected drug-related SAEs that require expedited reporting per FDA regulations. Now that safety parameters for limited use of MDMA in clinical settings have been established, a case can be made to further develop MDMA-assisted therapeutic interventions that could support autistic adults in increasing social adaptability among the typically developing population. As in the case with classic hallucinogens and other psychedelic drugs, MDMA catalyzes shifts toward openness and introspection that do not require ongoing administration to achieve lasting benefits. This infrequent dosing mitigates adverse event frequency and improves the risk/benefit ratio of MDMA, which may provide a significant advantage over medications that require daily dosing. Consequently, clinicians could employ new treatment models for social anxiety or similar types of distress administering MDMA on one to several occasions within the context of a supportive and integrative psychotherapy protocol.","Danforth Alicia L, Struble Christopher M, Yazar-Klosinski Berra, Grob Charles S",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,"Adult, Anxiety Disorders, Autistic Disorder, Double-Blind Method, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, N-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, Patient Selection, Pilot Projects, Prospective Studies, Psychotropic Drugs, Research Design, Social Perception",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25818246,"Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute, Torrance, CA, United States.

In the present study, we aimed at exploring ADHD and criminality. We estimated the prevalence of ADHD among longer-term prison inmates, described symptoms and cognitive functioning, and compared findings with ADHD among psychiatric outpatients and healthy controls. At Norrtälje Prison, we approached 315 male inmates for screening of childhood ADHD by the Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS-25) and for present ADHD by the Adult ADHD Self-Report Screener (ASRS-Screener). The response rate was 62%. Further, we assessed 34 inmates for ADHD and coexisting disorders. Finally, we compared findings with 20 adult males with ADHD, assessed at a psychiatric outpatient clinic and 18 healthy controls. The estimated prevalence of adult ADHD among longer-term inmates was 40%. Only 2 out of 30 prison inmates confirmed with ADHD had received a diagnosis of ADHD during childhood, despite most needed health services and educational support. All subjects reported lifetime substance use disorder (SUD) where amphetamine was the most common drug. Mood and anxiety disorders were present among half of subjects; autism spectrum disorder (ASD) among one fourth and psychopathy among one tenth. Personality disorders were common; almost all inmates presented conduct disorder (CD) before antisocial personality disorder (APD). Prison inmates reported more ADHD symptoms during both childhood and adulthood, compared with ADHD psychiatric outpatients. Further, analysis of executive functions after controlling for IQ showed both ADHD groups performed poorer than controls on working memory tests. Besides, on a continuous performance test, the ADHD prison group displayed poorer results compared with both other groups. This study suggested ADHD to be present among 40% of adult male longer-term prison inmates. Further, ADHD and coexisting disorders, such as SUD, ASD, personality disorders, mood- and anxiety disorders, severely affected prison inmates with ADHD. Besides, inmates showed poorer executive functions also when controlling for estimated IQ compared with ADHD among psychiatric outpatients and controls. Our findings imply the need for considering these severities when designing treatment programmes for prison inmates with ADHD.","Ginsberg Ylva, Hirvikoski Tatja, Lindefors Nils",BMC psychiatry,"Adult, Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity, Cognition Disorders, Comorbidity, Criminal Law, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Executive Function, Humans, Male, Mental Disorders, Neuropsychological Tests, Prevalence, Prisoners, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Psychometrics, Surveys and Questionnaires, Sweden, Time Factors",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21176203,"Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Division of Psychiatry, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. ylva.ginsberg@ki.se"

Visual signals are initially processed in the retina, and in this study, we explored the hypotheses that the GABA-dependent retinal response to light is altered in individuals with ASD. Light-adapted electroretinograms were recorded from 61 adults (38 males and 23 females; <i>n</i> = 22 ASD) in response to three stimulus protocols: (1) the standard white flash, (2) the standard 30 Hz flickering protocol, and (3) the photopic negative response protocol. Participants were administered an oral dose of placebo, 15 or 30 mg of arbaclofen (STX209, GABA<sub>B</sub> agonist) in a randomized, double-blind, crossover order before the test. At baseline (placebo), the a-wave amplitudes in response to single white flashes were more prominent in ASD, relative to typically developed (TD) participants. Arbaclofen was associated with a decrease in the a-wave amplitude in ASD, but an increase in TD, eliminating the group difference observed at baseline. The extent of this arbaclofen-elicited shift significantly correlated with the arbaclofen-elicited shift in cortical responses to auditory stimuli as measured by using an electroencephalogram in our prior study and with broader autistic traits measured with the autism quotient across the whole cohort. Hence, GABA-dependent differences in retinal light processing in ASD appear to be an accessible component of a wider autistic difference in the central processing of sensory information, which may be upstream of more complex autistic phenotypes.","Huang Qiyun, Ellis Claire L, Leo Shaun M, Velthuis Hester, Pereira Andreia C, Dimitrov Mihail, Ponteduro Francesca M, Wong Nichol M L, Daly Eileen, Murphy Declan G M, Mahroo Omar A, McAlonan Gráinne M",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,"Male, Adult, Female, Humans, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Retina, Electroencephalography, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid, Electroretinography",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38467434,"Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London SE5 8AF, United Kingdom grainne.mcalonan@kcl.ac.uk.; Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London EC1V 2PD, United Kingdom.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London SE5 8AF, United Kingdom."

Preclinical models implicate ϒ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in this process. However, the link between GABA and auditory processing in humans (with or without ASD) is largely correlational. As part of a study of potential biosignatures of GABA function in ASD to inform future clinical trials, we evaluated the role of GABA in auditory repetition suppression in 66 adults (n = 28 with ASD). Neurophysiological responses (temporal and frequency domains) to repetitive standard tones and novel deviants presented in an oddball paradigm were compared after double-blind, randomized administration of placebo, 15 or 30 mg of arbaclofen (STX209), a GABA type B (GABA<sub>B</sub>) receptor agonist. We first established that temporal mismatch negativity was comparable between participants with ASD and those with typical development (TD). Next, we showed that temporal and spectral responses to repetitive standards were suppressed relative to responses to deviants in the two groups, but suppression was significantly weaker in individuals with ASD at baseline. Arbaclofen reversed weaker suppression of spectral responses in ASD but disrupted suppression in TD. A post hoc analysis showed that arbaclofen-elicited shift in suppression was correlated with autistic symptomatology measured using the Autism Quotient across the entire group, though not in the smaller sample of the ASD and TD group when examined separately. Thus, our results confirm: GABAergic dysfunction contributes to the neurophysiology of auditory sensory processing alterations in ASD, and can be modulated by targeting GABA<sub>B</sub> activity.

In the placebo condition, the neurotypical SSVEP response was affected by both the foreground stimuli contrast and background interference (suppression). In ASD, however, all stimuli conditions had equal salience and background suppression of the foreground response was weaker. In the placebo condition, although there was no difference in GABA+ between groups, GABA+ concentration positively correlated with response to maximum foreground contrast during maximum background interference in neurotypicals, but not ASD. In neurotypicals, sensitivity to visual stimuli was disrupted by 30 mg of arbaclofen, whereas in ASD, it was made more “typical” and visual processing differences were abolished.

31451579,10.1523/Jneurosci.0836-19.2019,GABAergic Inhibition Gates Perceptual Awareness During Binocular Rivalry.,2019-10-16,"Binocular rivalry is a classic experimental tool to probe the neural machinery of perceptual awareness. During rivalry, perception alternates between the two eyes, and the ebb and flow of perception is modeled to rely on the strength of inhibitory interactions between competitive neuronal populations in visual cortex. As a result, rivalry has been suggested as a noninvasive perceptual marker of inhibitory signaling in visual cortex, and its putative disturbance in psychiatric conditions, including autism. Yet, direct evidence causally implicating inhibitory signaling in the dynamics of binocular rivalry is currently lacking. We previously found that people with higher GABA levels in visual cortex, measured using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, have stronger perceptual suppression during rivalry. Here, we present direct causal tests of the impact of GABAergic inhibition on rivalry dynamics, and the contribution of specific GABA receptors to these dynamics. In a crossover pharmacological design with male and female adult participants, we found that drugs that modulate the two dominant GABA receptor types in the brain, GABA<sub>A</sub> (clobazam) and GABA<sub>B</sub> (arbaclofen), increase perceptual suppression during rivalry relative to a placebo. Crucially, these results could not be explained by changes in reaction times or response criteria, as determined through rivalry simulation trials, suggesting a direct and specific influence of GABA on perceptual suppression. A full replication study of the GABA<sub>B</sub> modulator reinforces these findings. These results provide causal evidence for a link between the strength of inhibition in the brain and perceptual suppression during rivalry and have implications for psychiatric conditions including autism.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How does the brain accomplish perceptual gating? Here we use a direct and causal pharmacological manipulation to present insight into the neural machinery of a classic illusion of perceptual awareness: binocular rivalry. We show that drugs that increase GABAergic inhibition in the brain, clobazam (GABA<sub>A</sub> modulator) and arbaclofen (GABA<sub>B</sub> modulator), increase perceptual suppression during rivalry relative to a placebo. These results present the first causal link between GABAergic inhibition and binocular rivalry in humans, complementing classic models of binocular rivalry, and have implications for our understanding of psychiatric conditions, such as autism, where binocular rivalry is posited as a behavioral marker of disruptions in inhibitory signaling in the brain.","Mentch Jeff, Spiegel Alina, Ricciardi Catherine, Robertson Caroline E",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,"Adolescent, Adult, Awareness, Baclofen, Clobazam, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Female, GABA-A Receptor Agonists, GABA-B Receptor Agonists, Humans, Male, Vision, Binocular, Visual Perception, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31451579,"School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, 21205, and.; Clinical Research Center, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139.; Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755, caroline.e.robertson@dartmouth.edu.; Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755."

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a parallel design that examined the efficacy of interventions for the treatment of irritability in patients of any age with ASD without any restrictions in terms of eligible interventions. We performed a random-effects meta-analysis by pooling effect sizes as Hedges' g. We classified assessed interventions as follows: pharmacological monotherapy, risperidone plus adjuvant therapy versus risperidone monotherapy, non-pharmacological intervention, and dietary intervention. We utilized the Cochrane tool to evaluate the risk of bias in each study and the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for each meta-analyzed intervention. Out of 5640 references, we identified 60 eligible articles with 45 different kinds of interventions, including 3531 participants, of which 80.9% were males (mean age [SD] = 8.79 [3.85]). For pharmacological monotherapy, risperidone (Hedges' g - 0.857, 95% CI - 1.263 to - 0.451, certainty of evidence: high) and aripiprazole (Hedges' g - 0.559, 95% CI - 0.767 to - 0.351, certainty of evidence: high) outperformed placebo. Among the non-pharmacological interventions, parent training (Hedges' g - 0.893, 95% CI - 1.184 to - 0.602, certainty of evidence: moderate) showed a significant result.

33857522,10.1016/J.Pnpbp.2021.110326,The pediatric psychopharmacology of autism spectrum disorder: A systematic review - Part I: The past and the present.,2021-08-30,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a severe and lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder, with high social costs and a dramatic burden on the quality of life of patients and family members. Despite its high prevalence, reaching 1/54 children and 1/45 adults in the United States, no pharmacological treatment is still directed to core symptoms of ASD, encompassing social and communication deficits, repetitive behaviors, restricted interests, and abnormal sensory processing. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art of psychopharmacological therapy available today for ASD in children and adolescents, in order to foster best practices and to organize new strategies for future research. To date, atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone and aripiprazole represent the first line of intervention for hyperactivity, impulsivity, agitation, temper outbursts or aggression towards self or others. Tricyclic antidepressants are less prescribed because of uncertain efficacy and important side effects. SSRIs, especially fluoxetine and sertraline, may be effective in treating repetitive behaviors (anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms) and irritability/agitation, while mirtazapine is more helpful with sleep problems. Low doses of buspirone have shown some efficacy on restrictive and repetitive behaviors in combination with behavioral interventions. Stimulants, and to a lesser extent atomoxetine, are effective in reducing hyperactivity, inattention and impulsivity also in comorbid ASD-ADHD, although with somewhat lower efficacy and greater incidence of side effects compared to idiopathic ADHD. Clonidine and guanfacine display some efficacy on hyperactivity and stereotypic behaviors. For several other drugs, case reports and open-label studies suggest possible efficacy, but no randomized controlled trial has yet been performed. Research in the pediatric psychopharmacology of ASD is still faced with at least two major hurdles: (a) Great interindividual variability in clinical response and side effect sensitivity is observed in the ASD population. This low level of predictability would benefit from symptom-specific treatment algorithms and from biomarkers to support drug choice; (b) To this date, no psychoactive drug appears to directly ameliorate core autism symptoms, although some indirect improvement has been reported with several drugs, once the comorbid target symptom is abated.","Persico Antonio M, Ricciardello Arianna, Lamberti Marco, Turriziani Laura, Cucinotta Francesca, Brogna Claudia, Vitiello Benedetto, Arango Celso",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,"Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic, Antipsychotic Agents, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Central Nervous System Stimulants, Child, Clinical Trials as Topic, Humans, Psychopharmacology, Psychotropic Drugs, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33857522,"Child & Adolescent Psychiatry Unit, ""Franz Tappeiner"" Hospital, Merano (BZ), Italy.; Interdepartmental Program ""Autism 0-90"", ""G.

This randomized double-blind parallel-group study was conducted in three academic medical centers and a single private pediatric practice. Eighty children or adolescents (aged 6-17 yrs) with autistic disorder were enrolled, and 61 patients were randomized to the study drug. Of those patients, 51 completed the 10-week trial, and 31 completed an optional 12-week blinded extension phase. All patients were treated with 2 weeks of placebo before random assignment to receive aripiprazole (31 patients) or risperidone (30 patients) for 10 weeks. Sixteen placebo responders (20%) were excluded from further analysis. Drug dosing followed U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling, and weekly dosage adjustments were allowed until week 4; patients were then maintained on a fixed dose for 6 additional weeks. Safety, physical, and psychological assessments were recorded weekly or every 2 weeks. No significant differences in severity of illness between the aripiprazole and risperidone groups were noted at baseline. All patients significantly improved on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability subscale after 1 week and continued for the remaining 9 weeks and the extension phase. Improvement was greatest in the risperidone group at every assessment period and was statistically significantly better than that in the aripiprazole group at weeks 3 and 6 (p<0.05). No dose-limiting adverse events occurred during the dose-titration period. Mean weight gain in the aripiprazole group was significantly less than that in the risperidone group at week 4 (0.62 vs 1.38 kg, p=0.033) and week 10 (1.61 vs 3.31 kg, p<0.001), but the difference became nonsignificant for the 31 patients completing the 3-month extension phase (4.36 vs 5.55 kg, p=0.26). Pharmacotherapy of patients with autism spectrum disorder resulted in behavioral improvement within 1 week and lasted at least 22 weeks. Weight gain occurred to a greater degree with risperidone than aripiprazole initially, but the differences became nonsignificant by the end of the trial.

This can have major implications in child development, receptivity to behavioral therapy, as well as child and caregiver well-being. A systematic review and network meta-analysis were conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of atypical antipsychotics in treating irritability in these patients. Studies were identified from Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO from inception to March 2018. The clinical trials database was reviewed. Studies were included if they were a double-blind, randomized controlled trial utilizing the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability (ABC-I) to measure the efficacy of atypical antipsychotic monotherapy. Data extraction was carried out following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses for network meta-analysis guidelines. The main outcome was the reduction in irritability score using the ABC-I subscale from baseline. Eight trials comparing four interventions-risperidone, aripiprazole, lurasidone, and placebo in 878 patients, were included. Both risperidone and aripiprazole had significantly reduced ABC-I scores than placebo. Estimates of mean differences (95% credible intervals) were risperidone, -6.89 (-11.14, -2.54); aripiprazole, -6.62 (-10.88, -2.22); and lurasidone, -1.61 (-9.50, 6.23). Both risperidone and aripiprazole had similar safety. There were only eight studies included in the analysis, however, sample sizes were not small. Variance in reporting of adverse effects limited the quality of safety analysis. Risperidone and aripiprazole were the two best drugs, with comparable efficacy and safety in pediatric ASD patients.

From a pool of 301 potentially relevant references, we retained 12 pertinent studies (reported in 28 references), including 1 pharmacokinetics study, 1 double blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) for bipolar depression (BD) with 1 related interim analysis study of its extension phase and 1 related external posterior predictive check study, 1 double blind RCT for schizophrenia with 3 related interim analyses of its extension phase, 1 RCT and 1 case report for autism spectrum disorder, and 2 open-label studies focusing on a variety of disorders. Overall, these studies show that lurasidone is significantly more efficacious than placebo, with moderate effect sizes, and is well tolerated for BD and schizophrenia in youth. Published studies in youth have in general used doses up to 80 mg/day. Our case report suggests that high doses of lurasidone (148 mg/day) were well tolerated and might have contributed to substantial functional improvement in a 14-year old girl with psychosis and a previous history of anorexia nervosa, who had not responded to previous antipsychotics (olanzapine, risperidone, aripiprazole). There is increasing evidence that lurasidone may be moderately effective and well tolerated for the treatment of BD and psychosis in youth and may have procognitive effects.

Individuals in whom the disorders are comorbid show more severe impairment because of deficits in the processing of social situations, adaptive functioning, and executive control than individuals with either disorder alone. This open-label pilot study aimed to evaluate and compare the efficacy and tolerability of risperidone and aripiprazole for treating ADHD symptoms in patients with both ASD and ADHD over the course of 24 weeks of treatment. Patients (n = 44) were randomly assigned to start treatment with risperidone (22 patients) or aripiprazole (22 patients). Children were evaluated before starting treatment (T0), and after 12 weeks (T1) and 24 weeks (T2) of treatment.

In phase 1, single-blind aripiprazole was flexibly dosed (2-15 mg/d) for 13-26 weeks. Patients with a stable response (≥ 25% decrease in Aberrant Behavior Checklist-irritability subscale score and a rating of ""much improved"" or ""very much improved"" on the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale) for 12 consecutive weeks were randomized into phase 2 to continue aripiprazole or switch to placebo. Treatment was continued until relapse or up to 16 weeks. The primary end point was time from randomization to relapse. Eighty-five patients were randomized in phase 2. The difference in time to relapse between aripiprazole and placebo was not statistically significant (P = .097). Kaplan-Meier relapse rates at week 16 were 35% for aripiprazole and 52% for placebo (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.57; number needed to treat [NNT] = 6).

A 12-lead electrocardiogram was obtained at the baseline and end point visits. The electrocardiograms were evaluated for abnormal findings, and the PR, QRS, QT(c), and RR intervals were recorded. The QT interval was corrected using Bazett's, United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Pharmacology Division, and Fridericia's formulas. Twenty-four subjects received both baseline and posttreatment electrocardiograms. The mean age was 8.6 years (range 5-17 years). The average final aripiprazole dose was 7.8 mg/day (range 2.5-15 mg/day). There were no significant differences noted with the PR, QRS, RR, and QT(c) intervals after aripiprazole therapy. Also, there was no significant correlation between the dose given and the percent change in the QT(c). No post-treatment QT(c) exceeded 440 ms. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic evaluation of the cardiac effects of aripiprazole in children and adolescents. The results are consistent with previously published literature in adults that aripiprazole has no significant cardiac effects and can be deemed a low risk for causing sudden death.

Clonidine, methylphenidate, valproate and levocarnitine monotherapy were superior to placebo in single RCTs, while adjunctive treatments cyproheptadine, pentoxifylline and topiramate were superior to placebo in small studies when given in combination with an antipsychotic. Adverse events from RCTs were summarized, including weight gain and metabolic effects, if available. The bulk of positive RCT evidence for the pharmacotherapy of irritability of autism pertains to FDA approved antipsychotics risperidone and aripiprazole. RCTs supporting efficacy of several alternative and adjunctive agents may afford additional treatment options when optimal antipsychotic doses fail to control symptoms or cause intolerable adverse effects. Behavioural therapy should be employed where possible either before, or in addition to pharmacotherapy.","Elbe Dean, Lalani Zaahira",Journal of the Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry = Journal de l'Academie canadienne de psychiatrie de l'enfant et de l'adolescent,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22548111,"Children's and Women's Mental Health Programs, BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia."

Many children actually show a decline in adaptive skills compared with age mates over time. This 24-week, three-site, controlled clinical trial randomized 124 children (4 through 13 years of age) with PDDs and serious behavioral problems to medication alone (MED; n = 49; risperidone 0.5 to 3.5 mg/day; if ineffective, switch to aripiprazole was permitted) or a combination of medication plus parent training (PT) (COMB; n = 75). Parents of children in COMB received an average of 11.4 PT sessions. Standard scores and Age-Equivalent scores on Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales were the outcome measures of primary interest. Seventeen subjects did not have a post-randomization Vineland assessment. Thus, we used a mixed model with outcome conditioned on the baseline Vineland scores. Both groups showed improvement over the 24-week trial on all Vineland domains. Compared with MED, Vineland Socialization and Adaptive Composite Standard scores showed greater improvement in the COMB group (p = .01 and .05, and effect sizes = 0.35 and 0.22, respectively). On Age Equivalent scores, Socialization and Communication domains showed greater improvement in COMB versus MED (p = .03 and 0.05, and effect sizes = 0.33 and 0.14, respectively). Using logistic regression, children in the COMB group were twice as likely to make at least 6 months' gain (equal to the passage of time) in the Vineland Communication Age Equivalent score compared with MED (p = .02). After controlling for IQ, this difference was no longer significant. Reduction of serious maladaptive behavior promotes improvement in adaptive behavior. Medication plus PT shows modest additional benefit over medication alone.

Statistically significantly greater improvement was seen with aripiprazole versus placebo (p < 0.05) for all arms in both trials on the ABC-Irritability total subscale score and on the following individual ABC-Irritability items: Mood changes quickly, cries/screams inappropriately, and stamps feet/bangs objects. Several additional items measuring tantrum-like behaviors improved in the flexibly dosed trial and at least one arm of the fixed-dose trial (p < 0.05). Measures of self-injurious behavior, which had low baseline values, demonstrated numerical, but not statistically significant, improvement in both trials. Statistically significantly greater improvement in ABC Stereotypic Behavior and Hyperactivity total subscale scores was also consistent across all arms in both trials.

19718428,,Focus on aripiprazole: a review of its use in child and adolescent psychiatry.,2009-08-01,"To review published literature regarding aripiprazole in child and adolescent psychiatry. A literature review was conducted using the medline search term: 'aripiprazole' with limits: Human trials, English language, All Child (aged 0-18 years). Additional articles were identified from reference information and poster presentation data. Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic which was recently approved for use in Canada, but has been available for several years in the United States. Pharmacologically, aripiprazole is a partial agonist at D(2) and 5-HT(1A) receptors and an antagonist at 5-HT(2A) receptors. Randomized controlled trial data is available showing efficacy for aripiprazole in the treatment of children and adolescents with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and behavioural problems associated with autism. Open-label evidence is also available for use of aripiprazole in other disorders such as tic disorders, aggression and disruptive behavior disorders. Unlike some other available atypical antipsychotics, there does not appear to be any effect on QTc interval on the electrocardiogram. Adverse effects including extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), akathisia, sedation, headache, nausea were significant in clinical trials in children and adolescents. The possibility of aripiprazole causing tardive dyskinesia cannot be excluded. In this population, aripiprazole appears to have minimal impact on the metabolic profile compared to most other atypical antipsychotics, with minimal changes in weight or body mass index, no significant changes in glucose or lipid metabolism, and a decrease in serum prolactin. Aripiprazole may represent an important alternative for some children and adolescents who have experienced poor efficacy or significant metabolic adverse effects with their current antipsychotic treatment regimen.","Greenaway Masa'il, Elbe Dean",Journal of the Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry = Journal de l'Academie canadienne de psychiatrie de l'enfant et de l'adolescent,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19718428,"Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, BC."

In a 2 × 2 design, 128 children with ASD and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were randomly assigned ATX, PT+placebo, PT+ATX, or placebo alone. PT was weekly for 10 weeks, and then monthly. ATX/placebo was titrated over 6 weeks [≤1.8 mg/kg/d], and then maintained until week 10. Responders continued to week 34 or nonresponse. Placebo nonresponders had a 10-week ATX open trial; ATX nonresponders were treated clinically. All continued to week 34. With no further treatment from the study, all were invited to follow-up (FU) at 1.5 years postbaseline; 94 (73%) participated. Changes from Week 34 to FU and from baseline to FU were tested by one-way analysis of variance or chi-squared test. PT versus no PT was tested by chi-squared test, Fisher's exact test, Welch's t-test, Student's t-test, and Mann-Whitney's U test. For the whole sample, the primary outcomes (parent-rated ADHD on the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham [SNAP] scale and noncompliance on the Home Situations Questionnaire [HSQ]) deteriorated mildly from week 34 to FU, but were still substantially better than baseline (SNAP: t = 12.177, df = 93, p < 0.001; HSQ: t = 8.999, df = 93, p < 0.001). On the SNAP, 61% improved ≥30% from baseline (67% did at week 34); on noncompliance, 56% improved ≥30% from baseline (77% did at week 34). Outcomes with PT were not significantly better than without PT (SNAP p = 0.30; HSQ p = 0.27). Originally assigned treatment groups did not differ significantly. Only 34% still took ATX; 27% were taking stimulants; and 25% took no medication.

Primary outcome measures were the parent-rated DSM ADHD symptoms on the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham (SNAP) scale and Home Situations Questionnaire (HSQ). On the SNAP, ATX, ATX+PT and placebo+PT were each superior to placebo (effect sizes 0.57-0.98; p values of .0005, .0004, and .025, respectively). For noncompliance, ATX and ATX+PT were superior to placebo (effect sizes 0.47-0.64; p values .03 and .0028, respectively). ATX was associated with decreased appetite but was otherwise well tolerated. Both ATX and PT resulted in significant improvement on ADHD symptoms, whereas ATX (both alone and combined with PT) was associated with significant decreases on measures of noncompliance. ATX appears to have a better side effects profile than psychostimulants in the population with ASD.

Between November 22, 2016, and September 3, 2019, individuals were screened and randomly assigned to treatment groups. The primary efficacy analysis population comprised participants taking age-adjusted balovaptan equivalent to a 10-mg adult dose and participants from the concurrently randomized placebo group. This multicenter trial took place across 41 sites in the US. Participants were aged 5 to 17 years with diagnosed ASD and an IQ of 70 or greater. Data were analyzed from April 8 to November 16, 2020. Participants were randomly assigned to daily 4-mg or 10-mg adult-equivalent balovaptan or placebo, until the 4-mg group was discontinued. The primary end point was change from baseline on the Vineland-II two-domain composite (2DC; socialization and communication domains) score at week 24. Between November 2016 and September 2019, a total of 599 individuals were screened and 339 participants were randomly assigned to receive 4-mg balovaptan adult-equivalent dose (91 [26.8%]), 10-mg balovaptan adult-equivalent dose (126 [37.2%]), or placebo (122 [36.0%]).

Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older with an intelligence quotient (IQ) of 70 or higher, and met the criteria for moderate-to-severe autism spectrum disorder (DSM-5 and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule). Participants were randomly allocated (1:1), with an independent interactive voice or web-based response system, to receive balovaptan (10 mg) or placebo daily for 24 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by an individual's baseline Vineland-II two-domain composite (2DC) score (<60 or ≥60), sex, region (North America or rest of world), and age (<25 years or ≥25 years). Participants, study site personnel, and the sponsor were masked to treatment assignment.

Until now, there is no proven treatment for the core symptoms of ASD. However, some evidence indicates a crucial link between this disorder and GABAergic signals which are altered in ASD. Bumetanide is a diuretic that reduces chloride, shifts gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) from excitation to inhibition, and may play a significant role in the treatment of ASD. The objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of bumetanide as a treatment for ASD. Eighty children, aged 3-12 years, with ASD diagnosed by Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), ⩾ 30 were included in this double-blind, randomized, and controlled study. Group 1 received Bumetanide, Group 2 received a placebo for 6 months. Follow-up by CARS rating scale was performed before and after 1, 3, and 6 months of treatment. The use of bumetanide in group 1 improved the core symptoms of ASD in a shorter time with minimal and tolerable adverse effects. There was a statistically significant decrease in CARS and most of its fifteen items in group 1 <i>versus</i> group 2 after 6 months of treatment (p-value <0.001).

We observed superior bumetanide effects on EEG, reflected in increased absolute and relative alpha power and functional E/I ratio and in decreased central frequency. Associations between EEG and clinical outcome change were restricted to subgroups with medium to high RBS-R improvement. Using machine learning, medium and high RBS-R improvement could be predicted by baseline RBS-R score and EEG measures with 80% and 92% accuracy, respectively.

In the final sample, 119 children received at least one dose of bumetanide (59 children) or placebo (60 children) were included in the final analysis. The primary outcome was a reduction in the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) score, and the secondary outcomes were the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI) -Global Improvement (CGI-I) score at 3 months and the change from baseline to 3-month in the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS).

In an earlier phase 2 trial; bumetanide reduced the severity of ASD in children and adolescents (3-11 years old). Here we report the results of a multicenter phase 2B study primarily to assess dose/response and safety effects of bumetanide. Efficacy outcome measures included the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), the Social Responsive Scale (SRS) and the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Improvement scale (CGI-I). Eighty-eight patients with ASD spanning across the entire pediatric population (2-18 years old) were subdivided in four age groups and randomized to receive bumetanide (0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 mg twice daily) or placebo for 3 months. The mean CARS value was significantly improved in the completers group (P: 0.015). Also, 23 treated children had more than a six-point improvement in the CARS compared with only one placebo-treated individual. Bumetanide significantly improved CGI (P: 0.0043) and the SRS score by more than 10 points (P: 0.02). The most frequent adverse events were hypokalemia, increased urine elimination, loss of appetite, dehydration and asthenia.

Sixty children diagnosed with autism according to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) criteria (mean age of 4.5 years) were randomly divided into two groups: A single treatment group (n=28) and a combined treatment group (n=32). The combined treatment group received ABA training combined with oral bumetanide (0.5 mg twice a day). The single treatment group received ABA training only. Autism symptoms were evaluated with the Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), whereas severity of disease (SI) and global improvement (GI) were measured with the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI). Assessment of ABC, CARS, and CGI was performed immediately before and 3 months after initiation of the treatment(s). Prior to intervention(s) no statistically significant differences in scores on the ABC, CARS, SI, or GI were found between the two groups. Total scores of the ABC, CARS, and SI were decreased in both groups after 3 months (p<0.05) compared with the scores prior to treatment. The total scores of the ABC and the CGI were significantly (p<0.05) lower in the combined treatment group than in the single treatment group. Although the total and item scores of the CARS in the combined treatment group were lower than in the single treatment group after a 3 month intervention, they did not reach statistical significance. No adverse effects of bumetanide were observed. Treatment with bumetanide combined with ABA training may result in a better outcome in children with autism than ABA training alone.","Du Lin, Shan Ling, Wang Bing, Li Honghua, Xu Zhida, Staal Wouter G, Jia Feiyong",Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology,"Autistic Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Bumetanide, Checklist, Child, Child, Preschool, Combined Modality Therapy, Female, Humans, Male, Pilot Projects, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Sodium Potassium Chloride Symporter Inhibitors",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26258842,"2 Department of Psychiatry, University Medical Center , Utrecht, the Netherlands .; 1 Department of Pediatric Neurology and Neurorehabilitation, The First Hospital of Jilin University , Changchun, China .; 3 Department of Psychiatry, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Karakter, University Center , Nijmegen, the Netherlands ."

GABA-acting benzodiazepines exert in some patients with autism paradoxical effects, raising the possibility that like in epilepsies, GABA excites neurons because of elevated intracellular concentrations of chloride. Following a successful pilot study,(1) we have now performed a double-blind clinical trial using the diuretic, chloride-importer antagonist bumetanide that reduces intracellular chloride reinforcing GABAergic inhibition. Sixty children with autism or Asperger syndrome (3-11 years old) received for 3 months placebo or bumetanide (1 mg daily), followed by 1-month wash out. Determination of the severity of autism was made with video films at day 0 (D0) and D90 by blind, independent evaluators. Bumetanide reduced significantly the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) (D90-D0; P<0.004 treated vs placebo), Clinical Global Impressions (P<0.017 treated vs placebo) and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule values when the most severe cases (CARS values above the mean ± s.d.; n=9) were removed (Wilcoxon test: P-value=0.031; Student's t-test: P-value=0.017). Side effects were restricted to an occasional mild hypokalaemia (3.0-3.5 mM l(-1) K(+)) that was treated with supplemental potassium. In a companion study, chronic bumetanide treatment significantly improved accuracy in facial emotional labelling, and increased brain activation in areas involved in social and emotional perception (Hadjikhani et al., submitted).

The endocannabinoid system (ECS) seems to play a role in social behavior and emotional processing while it also seems to play a role in those neuropsychiatric conditions showing social cognition impairments. Main plant cannabinoids delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) modulate the ECS and, due to their opposite effects, have been proposed as both cause and treatment for neuropsychiatric-related disorders such as schizophrenia, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The aim of this study was to test the effects of THC and CBD on social cognition abilities in chronic cannabis users. <b>Method:</b> Eighteen members from a cannabis social club were tested for social cognition effects under the effects of different full spectrum cannabis extracts containing either THC, CBD, THC+CBD, or placebo in a naturalistic randomized double-blind crossover placebo-controlled study. <b>Results:</b> Results showed that participants under the effects of THC showed lower cognitive empathy when compared with the effects of CBD but not when those were compared with THC+CBD or placebo. Also, participants showed higher cognitive ToM under the effects of CBD when compared with the effects of placebo, but not when those were compared with THC or THC+CBD. However, we did not find differences on the emotional scales for empathy or ToM. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study provides evidence for the interaction between the effects of THC and CBD and social cognition abilities in a naturalistic environment, which can be of special interest for the clinical practice of medical cannabis on neuropsychiatric disorders. We show for the first time that CBD can improve ToM abilities in chronic cannabis users. Our results might help to understand the role of the ECS in social cognition, and their association with psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia or autism.

To expand intervention options, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of potential treatment targets, and their engagement, in the brain. For instance, the striatum (caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens) plays a central role during development and its (atypical) functional connectivity (FC) may contribute to multiple ASD symptoms. We have previously shown, in the adult autistic and neurotypical brain, the non-intoxicating cannabinoid cannabidivarin (CBDV) alters the balance of striatal 'excitatory-inhibitory' metabolites, which help regulate FC, but the effects of CBDV on (atypical) striatal FC are unknown. To examine this in a small pilot study, we acquired resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 28 men (15 neurotypicals, 13 ASD) on two occasions in a repeated-measures, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. We then used a seed-based approach to (1) compare striatal FC between groups and (2) examine the effect of pharmacological probing (600 mg CBDV/matched placebo) on atypical striatal FC in ASD. Visits were separated by at least 13 days to allow for drug washout. Compared to the neurotypicals, ASD individuals had lower FC between the ventral striatum and frontal and pericentral regions (which have been associated with emotion, motor, and vision processing). Further, they had higher intra-striatal FC and higher putamenal FC with temporal regions involved in speech and language. In ASD, CBDV reduced hyperconnectivity to the neurotypical level. Our findings should be considered in light of several methodological aspects, in particular our participant group (restricted to male adults), which limits the generalizability of our findings to the wider and heterogeneous ASD population. In conclusion, here we show atypical striatal FC with regions commonly associated with ASD symptoms. We further provide preliminary proof of concept that, in the adult autistic brain, acute CBDV administration can modulate atypical striatal circuitry towards neurotypical function. Future studies are required to determine whether modulation of striatal FC is associated with a change in ASD symptoms. clinicaltrials.gov, Identifier: NCT03537950.

This has led some families and researchers to trial alternative remedies - including the non-intoxicating Cannabis sativa-derived compound cannabidivarin (CBDV). However, how CBDV affects the human brain is unknown. Previous (pre)clinical evidence suggests that CBDV may modulate brain excitatory-inhibitory systems, which are implicated in ASD. Hence, our main aim was to test, for the first time, if CBDV shifts glutamate and/or GABA metabolites - markers of the brain's primary excitatory and inhibitory system - in both the 'typical' and autistic brain. Our subsidiary aim was to determine whether, within ASD, brain responsivity to CBDV challenge is related to baseline biological phenotype. We tested this using a repeated-measures, double-blind, randomized-order, cross-over design. We used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to compare glutamate (Glx = glutamate + glutamine) and GABA + (GABA + macromolecules) levels following placebo (baseline) and 600 mg CBDV in 34 healthy men with (n = 17) and without (n = 17) ASD. Data acquisition from regions previously reliably linked to ASD (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, DMPFC; left basal ganglia, BG) commenced 2 h (peak plasma levels) after placebo/CBDV administration. Where CBDV significantly shifted metabolite levels, we examined the relationship of this change with baseline metabolite levels. Test sessions were at least 13 days apart to ensure CBDV wash-out. CBDV significantly increased Glx in the BG of both groups. However, this impact was not uniform across individuals. In the ASD group, and not in the typically developing controls, the 'shift' in Glx correlated negatively with baseline Glx concentration. In contrast, CBDV had no significant impact on Glx in the DMPFC, or on GABA+ in either voxel in either group. Our findings suggest that, as measured by MRS, CBDV modulates the glutamate-GABA system in the BG but not in frontal regions. Moreover, there is individual variation in response depending on baseline biochemistry. Future studies should examine the effect of CBDV on behaviour and if the response to an acute dose of CBDV could predict a potential clinical treatment response in ASD.","Pretzsch Charlotte M, Voinescu Bogdan, Lythgoe David, Horder Jamie, Mendez Maria Andreina, Wichers Robert, Ajram Laura, Ivin Glynis, Heasman Martin, Edden Richard A E, Williams Steven, Murphy Declan G M, Daly Eileen, McAlonan Gráinne M",Translational psychiatry,"Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Basal Ganglia, Cannabinoids, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Female, Glutamic Acid, Gray Matter, Humans, Inhibition, Psychological, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Prefrontal Cortex, White Matter, Young Adult, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31748505,"Department of Neuroimaging Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; Russel H Morgan Department of Radiology and Radiological Science, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust Pharmacy, London, UK.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK. grainne.mcalonan@kcl.ac.uk."

However, the neural action of CBD, and its relevance to ASD, remains unclear. We and others have previously shown that response to drug challenge can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), but that pharmacological responsivity is atypical in ASD. We hypothesized that there would be a (different) fMRI response to CBD in ASD. To test this, task-free fMRI was acquired in 34 healthy men (half with ASD) following oral administration of 600 mg CBD or matched placebo (random order; double-blind administration). The 'fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations' (fALFF) was measured across the whole brain, and, where CBD significantly altered fALFF, we tested if functional connectivity (FC) of those regions was also affected by CBD. CBD significantly increased fALFF in the cerebellar vermis and the right fusiform gyrus. However, post-hoc within-group analyses revealed that this effect was primarily driven by the ASD group, with no significant change in controls. Within the ASD group only, CBD also significantly altered vermal FC with several of its subcortical (striatal) and cortical targets, but did not affect fusiform FC with other regions in either group. Our results suggest that, especially in ASD, CBD alters regional fALFF and FC in/between regions consistently implicated in ASD. Future studies should examine if this affects the complex behaviours these regions modulate.","Pretzsch Charlotte M, Voinescu Bogdan, Mendez Maria A, Wichers Robert, Ajram Laura, Ivin Glynis, Heasman Martin, Williams Steven, Murphy Declan Gm, Daly Eileen, McAlonan Gráinne M","Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)","Adult, Attention, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Brain, Brain Mapping, Cannabidiol, Cannabis, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Neural Pathways",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31237191,"South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust Pharmacy, London, UK.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; Department of Neuroimaging Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."
30758329,10.1038/S41386-019-0333-8,Effects of cannabidiol on brain excitation and inhibition systems; a randomised placebo-controlled single dose trial during magnetic resonance spectroscopy in adults with and without autism spectrum disorder.,2019-07-01,"There is increasing interest in the use of cannabis and its major non-intoxicating component cannabidiol (CBD) as a treatment for mental health and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, before launching large-scale clinical trials, a better understanding of the effects of CBD on brain would be desirable. Preclinical evidence suggests that one aspect of the polypharmacy of CBD is that it modulates brain excitatory glutamate and inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels, including in brain regions linked to ASD, such as the basal ganglia (BG) and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC). However, differences in glutamate and GABA pathways in ASD mean that the response to CBD in people with and without ASD may be not be the same. To test whether CBD 'shifts' glutamate and GABA levels; and to examine potential differences in this response in ASD, we used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure glutamate (Glx = glutamate + glutamine) and GABA+ (GABA + macromolecules) levels in 34 healthy men (17 neurotypicals, 17 ASD). Data acquisition commenced 2 h (peak plasma levels) after a single oral dose of 600 mg CBD or placebo. Test sessions were at least 13 days apart. Across groups, CBD increased subcortical, but decreased cortical, Glx. Across regions, CBD increased GABA+ in controls, but decreased GABA+ in ASD; the group difference in change in GABA + in the DMPFC was significant. Thus, CBD modulates glutamate-GABA systems, but prefrontal-GABA systems respond differently in ASD. Our results do not speak to the efficacy of CBD. Future studies should examine the effects of chronic administration on brain and behaviour, and whether acute brain changes predict longer-term response.","Pretzsch Charlotte Marie, Freyberg Jan, Voinescu Bogdan, Lythgoe David, Horder Jamie, Mendez Maria Andreina, Wichers Robert, Ajram Laura, Ivin Glynis, Heasman Martin, Edden Richard A E, Williams Steven, Murphy Declan G M, Daly Eileen, McAlonan Gráinne M",Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,"Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Basal Ganglia, Cannabidiol, Double-Blind Method, Glutamic Acid, Gray Matter, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Prefrontal Cortex, White Matter, Young Adult, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30758329,"Department of Neuroimaging Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; Russel H Morgan Department of Radiology and Radiological Science, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust Pharmacy, London, UK.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK. grainne.mcalonan@kcl.ac.uk."

Despite their prevalence and impact, there are no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed at evaluating the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for anxiolysis in this population, who may have a different biological basis for anxiety. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Secondary analyses of the STAART double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT of citalopram in children with ASD examined whether citalopram reduced anxiety measured on the parent-reported Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory-4 (CASI-4) as the primary outcome. An intention-to-treat analysis involving all 149 participants used multiple imputations for missing data and included baseline stratification factors of age group and site, among others. We prespecified as clinically significant a 33% reduction in anxiety in citalopram versus placebo, coinciding with 80% power. We tested whether communicative ability on the Vineland Communication score moderated treatment effect and explored whether initial anxiety was associated with greater adverse events, which could impact on dose titration and achieving optimal dose. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Both groups showed substantial reduction in anxiety. Citalopram was associated with a nonsignificant 16.5% greater reduction (observed coefficient = -0.181, bootstrap standard error = 0.126, <i>p</i> = 0.151, confidence interval = -0.428 to 0.066).

However, the molecular underpinnings of autistic-neurotypical serotonergic differences are challenging to access in vivo. Receptor-Enriched Analysis of functional Connectivity by Targets (REACT) has helped define molecular-enriched functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain networks based on a priori information about the spatial distribution of neurochemical systems from available PET templates. We used REACT to estimate the dominant fMRI signal related to the serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT) distribution during processing of aversive facial emotion in adults with and without ASD. We first predicted a group difference in baseline (placebo) functioning of this system. We next used a single 20 mg oral dose of citalopram, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, to test the hypothesis that network activity in people with and without ASD would respond differently to inhibition of SERT. To confirm the specificity of our findings, we also repeated the analysis with 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A and 5-HT4 receptor maps. Using REACT with the SERT map, we found a baseline group difference in the SERT-enriched response to faces in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. A single oral dose of citalopram 'shifted' the response in the ASD group towards the neurotypical baseline but did not alter response in the control group. Similar differences in SERT-enriched response were observed after controlling for other 5-HT maps. Our findings suggest that the SERT-enriched functional network is dynamically different in ASD during processing of socially relevant stimuli. Whether this acute neurobiological response to citalopram in ASD translates to a clinical target will be an important next step.","Wong Nichol Ml, Dipasquale Ottavia, Turkheimer Federico, Findon James L, Wichers Robert H, Dimitrov Mihail, Murphy Clodagh M, Stoencheva Vladimira, Robertson Dene M, Murphy Declan G, Daly Eileen, McAlonan Grainne M","Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)","Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Brain, Citalopram, Cross-Over Studies, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Serotonin, Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35491679,"Department of Neuroimaging, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; Behavioural Genetics Clinic, Adult Autism and ADHD Service, Behavioural and Developmental Psychiatry Clinical Academic Group, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK."

The biological basis of this is poorly understood but may include neurochemically mediated differences in the responsivity of key 'limbic' regions (including amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc)). Emerging evidence also suggests that ASD may be a disorder of brain temporal dynamics. Moreover, serotonin (5-HT) has been shown to be a key regulator of both facial-emotion processing and brain dynamics, and 5-HT abnormalities have been consistently implicated in ASD. To date, however, no one has examined how 5-HT influences the dynamics of facial-emotion processing in ASD. Therefore, we compared the influence of 5-HT on the responsivity of brain dynamics during facial-emotion processing in individuals with and without ASD. Participants completed a facial-emotion processing fMRI task at least 8 days apart using a randomised double-blind crossover design. At each visit they received either a single 20-mg oral dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram or placebo. We found that citalopram (which increases levels of 5-HT) caused sustained activation in key limbic regions during processing of negative facial emotions in adults with ASD-but not in neurotypical adults. The neurotypical adults' limbic response reverted more rapidly to baseline following a 5-HT-challenge. Our results suggest that serotonergic homoeostatic control of the temporal dynamics in limbic regions is altered in adults with ASD, and provide a fresh perspective on the biology of ASD.","Wong Nichol M L, Findon James L, Wichers Robert H, Giampietro Vincent, Stoencheva Vladimira, Murphy Clodagh M, Blainey Sarah, Ecker Christine, Murphy Declan G, McAlonan Grainne M, Daly Eileen",Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,"Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Cross-Over Studies, Emotions, Facial Expression, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Serotonin",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388538,"Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK. nichol.wong@kcl.ac.uk.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy, Goethe University Frankfurt am Main, Frankfurt, Germany.; Department of Neuroimaging, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."

However, there is limited evidence to support this practice. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the impact of SSRIs on brain function abnormalities in ASD. It has been suggested that some core symptoms in ASD are underpinned by deficits in executive functioning (EF). Hence, we investigated the role of the SSRI citalopram on EF networks in 19 right-handed adult males with ASD and 19 controls who did not differ in gender, age, IQ or handedness. We performed pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare brain activity during two EF tasks (of response inhibition and sustained attention) after an acute dose of 20 mg citalopram or placebo using a randomised, double-blind, crossover design. Under placebo condition, individuals with ASD had abnormal brain activation in response inhibition regions, including inferior frontal, precentral and postcentral cortices and cerebellum. During sustained attention, individuals with ASD had abnormal brain activation in middle temporal cortex and (pre)cuneus. After citalopram administration, abnormal brain activation in inferior frontal cortex was 'normalised' and most of the other brain functional differences were 'abolished'. Also, within ASD, the degree of responsivity in inferior frontal and postcentral cortices to SSRI challenge was related to plasma serotonin levels. These findings suggest that citalopram can 'normalise' atypical brain activation during EF in ASD. Future trials should investigate whether this shift in the biology of ASD is maintained after prolonged citalopram treatment, and if peripheral measures of serotonin predict treatment response.","Wichers Robert H, Findon James L, Jelsma Auke, Giampietro Vincent, Stoencheva Vladimira, Robertson Dene M, Murphy Clodagh M, McAlonan Grainne, Ecker Christine, Rubia Katya, Murphy Declan G M, Daly Eileen M",Translational psychiatry,"Adult, Attention, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Brain, Brain Mapping, Citalopram, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Executive Function, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, Visual Analog Scale, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31712584,"Department of Neuroimaging, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, The Sackler Centre for Translational Neurodevelopment, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK. rob.wichers@kcl.ac.uk.; Behavioural and Developmental Psychiatry Clinical Academic Group, South London and Maudsley NHS Trust, London, UK.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, The Sackler Centre for Translational Neurodevelopment, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; Department of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy, University Hospital Frankfurt am Main, Goethe-University Frankfurt am Main, Frankfurt, Germany."

However, significantly fewer individuals receiving clomipramine versus haloperidol were able to complete the trial (37.5% vs. 69.7%, respectively) for reasons related to both side effects and efficacy or behavior problems. In the intent-to-treat sample, which is perhaps more clinically relevant, only haloperidol proved superior to baseline on a global measure of autistic symptom severity, as well as specific measures for irritability and hyperactivity. Clomipramine did not seem more effective on a measure of stereotypy, nor was it better tolerated.","Remington G, Sloman L, Konstantareas M, Parker K, Gow R",Journal of clinical psychopharmacology,"Adolescent, Adult, Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic, Antipsychotic Agents, Autistic Disorder, Basal Ganglia Diseases, Clomipramine, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Female, Haloperidol, Humans, Male, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Stereotyped Behavior, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11476129,"Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Clarke Division, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. gary_remington@camh.net"

Previous studies have suggested a relation between serotonergic function and clinical outcome in serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. In a randomized, double-blind trial, comparing clomipramine, paroxetine, and a placebo in obsessive-compulsive disorder, serotonin levels in whole blood (WB-5-HT) were measured at baseline, after 1 week, and after 4 weeks of treatment and related to clinical outcome in 36 patients. In patients treated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors there was a pronounced decrease of WB-5-HT, variable after 1 week and uniformly maximal after 4 weeks. The decrease of WB-5-HT after 1 week of serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment correlated negatively with clinical outcome after 12 weeks (r = -.61, p =.0006); hence, patients with slower WB-5-HT reactivity eventually responded better to treatment. Baseline WB-5-HT, but not WB-5-HT reactivity, was related to season. Depression, autistic traits, and previous serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment predicted nonresponse. A fast decrease of WB-5-HT was associated with poor clinical outcome. This may be related to faster serotonin efflux from platelets, which has previously been linked to autism. Further studies are necessary to identify the underlying mechanism and discern whether serotonin reuptake inhibitor-induced WB-5-HT decrease is clinically useful.","Humble M, Bejerot S, Bergqvist P B, Bengtsson F",Biological psychiatry,"Adult, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Paroxetine, Serotonin, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11239907,"Psychiatry of Northern Dalecarlia, Mora Hospital, Mora, Sweden."

Our secondary hypothesis was that the usual doses of zuclopenthixol and/or clonazepam would decrease in the venlafaxine-treated group. In a randomized double-blind study, we compared six patients who received venlafaxine along with their usual treatment (zuclopenthixol and/or clonazepam) with seven patients who received placebo plus usual care. Irritability, hyperactivity/noncompliance, and overall clinical improvement were measured after 2 and 8 weeks, using validated clinical scales. Univariate analyses showed that the symptom of irritability improved in the entire sample (p = 0.023 after 2 weeks, p = 0.061 at study endpoint), although no difference was observed between the venlafaxine and placebo groups. No significant decrease in hyperactivity/noncompliance was observed during the study. At the end of the study, global improvement was observed in 33% of participants treated with venlafaxine and in 71% of participants in the placebo group (p = 0.29). The study found that decreased cumulative doses of clonazepam and zuclopenthixol were required for the venlafaxine group. Multivariate analyses (principal component analyses) with at least three combinations of variables showed that the two populations could be clearly separated (p b 0.05). Moreover, in all cases, the venlafaxine population had lower values for the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Behavior Problems Inventory (BPI), and levels of urea with respect to the placebo group. In one case, a reduction in the dosage of clonazepam was also suggested. For an additional set of variables (ABC factor 2, BPI frequency of aggressive behaviors, hematic ammonia at Day 28, and zuclopenthixol and clonazepam intake), the separation between the two samples was statistically significant as was the Bartlett's test, but the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy was below the accepted threshold. This set of variables showed a reduction in the cumulative intake of both zuclopenthixol and clonazepam. Despite the small sample sizes, this study documented a statistically significant effect of venlafaxine. Moreover, we showed that lower doses of zuclopenthixol and clonazepam were needed in the venlafaxine group, although this difference was not statistically significant. This was confirmed by multivariate analyses, where this difference reached statistical significance when using a combination of variables involving zuclopenthixol.

The clonidine treatment showed a significant difference from placebo treatment on three subscales of the Ritvo-Freeman Real Life Rating Scale (i.e., social relationship to people, affectual responses, and sensory responses). The Clinical Global Impressions scale indicated that clonidine produced a significant improvement on severity of illness, global improvement, and efficacy index for therapeutic effect of the drug. A patient global rating scale showed clonidine treatment resulted in significant improvement in comparison with placebo. Adverse effects included sedation and fatigue during the first 2 weeks of clonidine treatment.

Irritability/aggression is a significant comorbid symptom in this population, which greatly impacts burden of care. This study examined the effect of divalproex sodium for irritability/aggression in children and adolescents with ASD. This was a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. All efficacy measures were obtained by an independent evaluator blinded to randomization condition and side effects. A total of 55 subjects gavetheir consent and 27 were randomized in a 1 : 1 manner (mean age 9.46+/-2.46, mean nonverbal IQ 63.3+/-23.9). Two subjects from the active group and one subject from the placebo group discontinued the study because of either a lack of efficacy or side effects (increased irritability). Primary outcome measures were Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability subscale and Clinical Global Impression-Improvement, which focused on irritability. Overall, 62.5% of divalproex subjects vs 9% of placebo subjects were responders (CGI-irritability OR: 16.7, Fisher's exact p=0.008). A statistically significant improvement was also noted on the ABC-Irritability subscale (p=0.048). There was a trend for responders to have higher valproate blood levels compared with nonresponders.

This study investigated the effects of donepezil hydrochloride, a cholinesterase inhibitor that has potential to correct aberrant cholinergic signaling. Forty-two individuals with fragile X syndrome (mean age=19.61 years) were randomized to receive 2.5-10.0 mg of donepezil (<i>n</i>=20, seven females) or placebo (<i>n</i>=22, eight females) per day. One individual in the active group withdrew at week 7. Outcomes included the contingency naming test, the aberrant behavior checklist, and behavior and brain activation patterns during a functional magnetic resonance imaging gaze discrimination task. There were no significant differences between active and placebo groups on cognitive (contingency naming task) or behavioral (total score or subscales of the aberrant behavior checklist) outcomes. At baseline, the active and placebo groups did not differ in functional magnetic resonance imaging activation patterns during the gaze task. After 12 weeks of treatment the active group displayed reduced activation in response to the averted vs direct gaze contrast, relative to the placebo group, in the left superior frontal gyrus. Reduced functional brain activation for the active group may represent less arousal in response to direct eye gaze, relative to the placebo group. Change in functional magnetic resonance imaging activation patterns may serve as a more sensitive metric and predictor of response to treatment when compared to cognitive and behavioral assessments.

We systematically reviewed the efficacy and harms of pharmacologic treatments for sleep disorders in children and adolescents. We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane library databases, and PsycINFO through June 2018. We included 22 placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (1-13 weeks' duration), involving 1758 children (mean age 8.2 years). Single randomized controlled trials of zolpidem and eszopiclone in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) showed no improvement in sleep or ADHD ratings. Clinical Global Impression Improvement/Severity scores significantly improved with zolpidem ( P = .03 and P = .006, respectively). A single, small randomized controlled trial of diphenhydramine reported small improvements in sleep outcomes (8-10 minutes' better sleep latency and duration) after 1 week. In 19 randomized controlled trials, melatonin significantly improved sleep latency (median 28 minutes; range 11-51 minutes), sleep duration (median 33 minutes; range 14-68 minutes), and wake time after sleep onset (range 12-43 minutes), but not number of awakenings per night (range 0-2.7). Function and behavior improvement varied. Improvement in sleep was greatest in children with autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders, and smaller in adolescents and children with chronic delayed sleep onset. Adverse events were infrequent with melatonin, but more frequent than placebo in children taking eszopiclone or zolpidem. These findings show that melatonin was useful in improving some sleep outcomes in the short term, particularly those with comorbid ASD and neurodevelopmental disorders.

After fenfluramine treatment blood serotonin levels fell, urinary catecholamine levels fell and the HVA/DA ratio rose. IQ and ACRT performance improved. On the ACRT subjects were asked to press a button to a rare target (500 Hz, P = 0.14) and to ignore higher pitched rare (2,000 Hz, P = 0.14) and frequent non-targets (1,000 Hz). After fenfluramine treatment N1 latencies increased. The scalp distribution of ERP maxima changes slightly with treatment. P3 maxima elicited by rare non-targets were recorded more rostrally after fenfluramine treatment. After rare non-targets N1 amplitudes at Fz decreased but P3 amplitudes at Pz increased. Early negativity after the rare non-target (particularly on the right side) was negatively correlated with the HVA/DA ratio. Subtraction of the P3 component elicited in a passive condition where no response was required from the active condition showed that P3 positivity to targets was halved with treatment. (In contrast Nd increased on fenfluramine treatment). Overall, N1 and P3 components showed greatest responsiveness to rare non-targets on fenfluramine. N1 but not P3 changes may represent slight improvement of attention-related function with treatment.

To date, clinical trials examining the use of SSRIs in autism have been limited by small sample sizes and inconclusive results. The efficacy and safety of SSRIs for moderating autistic behaviors is yet to be adequately examined to provide evidence to support current clinical practice. The aim of the Fluoxetine for Autistic Behaviors (FAB) study is to determine the efficacy and safety of low dose fluoxetine compared with placebo, for reducing the frequency and severity of repetitive stereotypic behaviors in children and adolescents with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The relationship between the effectiveness of fluoxetine treatment and serotonin transporter genotype will also be explored. The FAB study is a multicenter, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial, funded by the Australian Government's National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) grant. Participants will be aged between 7.5 and 17 years with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD. Eligible participants will be randomized to either placebo or fluoxetine for a 16-week period. Medication will be titrated over the first four weeks. Reponses to medication will be monitored fortnightly using the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI). The primary outcome measure is the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale-Modified for Pervasive Developmental Disorders (CYBOCS-PDD), administered at baseline and 16 weeks. Secondary outcome measures include the Aberrant Behaviour Scale (ABC), the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale Parent Report (SCAS-P), and the Repetitive Behaviors Scale (RBS-R), measured at baseline and 16 weeks. Participants will be invited to undergo genetic testing for SLC6A4 allele variants using a cheek swab. Continuous outcomes, including the primary outcome will be compared between the active and placebo groups using unadjusted linear regression. Binary outcomes will be compared using unadjusted logistic regression. The FAB study is a large clinical trial to specifically investigate the efficacy of low dose fluoxetine for restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped behaviors in ASD. The outcomes of this study will contribute to evidence-based interventions used in clinical practice to assist children with ASD.

Low-dose liquid fluoxetine (mean final dose: 9.9+/-4.35 mg/day) was superior to placebo in the treatment of repetitive behaviors by CY-BOCS compulsion scale. The effect size was in the moderate to large range, and the doses used were low. Liquid fluoxetine was only slightly, and not significantly, superior to placebo on CGI autism score partially due to a phase order effect. However, fluoxetine was marginally superior to placebo on a composite measure of global effectiveness. Liquid fluoxetine did not significantly differ from placebo on treatment emergent side effects. Liquid fluoxetine in low doses is more effective than placebo in the treatment of repetitive behaviors in childhood autism.

Genetic variation of the serotonin receptor may influence the efficacy of fluvoxamine treatment. We studied the correlation between clinical responses to fluvoxamine and serotonin receptor gene polymorphism (5-HT2AR) in children with an autistic disorder. Eighteen patients completed a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover study. Clinical global impression (CGI) by child neurologists and interviews for parents were assessed after 12 weeks of fluvoxamine treatment. Behavioral assessments consisting of 20 items by newly created Behavioral Assessment Scale (BAS) were obtained before as well as 6 and 12 weeks after treatment. For genotyping of 5-HT2AR, 102 T/C polymorphism was analyzed by the PCR method. Seven cases of T/T, 6 of T/C and 5 of C/C were identified. The patients with the genotype T/C responded more favorably when estimated by CGI and parents' report at 12 weeks of treatment. Although not significant statistically (p = 0.0578), the number of improved BAS items in these patients were larger after fluvoxamine than placebo treatment.

The core symptoms of autism are abnormalities in social interaction, communication and behaviour. The involvement of neurotransmitters such as 5-HT has been suggested in neuropsychiatric disorders and particularly in autistic disorder. Increased platelet 5-HT levels were found in 40% of the autistic population, suggesting that hyperserotonaemia may be a pathologic factor in infantile autism. Therefore, it is of interest to assess the efficacy of cyproheptadine, a 5-HT2 antagonist in the treatment of autistic disorder. In this 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we assessed the effects of cyproheptadine plus haloperidol in the treatment of autistic disorder. Children between the ages 3 and 11 years (inclusive) with a DSM IV clinical diagnosis of autism and who were outpatients from a specialty clinic for children at Roozbeh Psychiatric Teaching Hospital were recruited. The children presented with a chief complaint of severely disruptive symptoms related to autistic disorder. Patients were randomly allocated to cyproheptadine + haloperidol (Group A) or haloperidol + placebo (Group B) for an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The dose of haloperidol and cyproheptadine was titrated up to 0.05 and 0.2 mg/kg/day respectively. Patients were assessed by a third-year resident of psychiatry at baseline and after 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks of starting medication. The primary measure of the outcome was the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist-Community (ABC-C) and the secondary measure of the outcome was the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (relating to people and verbal communication). Side effects and extrapyramidal symptoms were systematically recorded throughout the study and were assessed using a checklist and the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale, administered by a resident of psychiatry during weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8. The ABC-C and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale scores improved with cyproheptadine. The behaviour of the two treatments was not homogeneous across time (groups-by-time interaction, Greenhouse-Geisser correction; F = 7.30, d.f. = 1.68, P = 0.002; F = 8.21, d.f. = 1.19, P = 0.004 respectively).

No significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of extrapyramidal symptoms (P = 0.23). The difference between the two groups in the frequency of side effects was not significant.

Mecamylamine, because of its safety record in children with other disorders, was chosen for this first exploration. Twenty children with autism spectrum disorder age 4-12 years were randomly assigned for 14 weeks to placebo (n=8) or mecamylamine (n=12) in ascending fixed doses: 0.5 mg/day for 6 weeks, 2.5 mg for 2 weeks, then 5 mg/day for 6 weeks. Improvement was rated by a blinded independent evaluator. Because of small sample, data analysis was descriptive. Eighteen participants (10 mecamylamine, 8 placebo) completed the study. All doses were well tolerated; the only side effect of note was constipation (50% compared with 25% of placebo group). Three children had clinically nonsignificant electrocardiographic QT prolongation. Both groups showed modest to moderate improvement, but differences between groups were negligible. On the primary outcome measure, the Ohio Autism Clinical Impressions Scale, 90% of the active treatment group showed improvement at some point (but only 40% sustained it), compared with 62% on placebo. Of the four in active treatment that sustained improvement, three had a maximum dose of 0.13-0.15 mg/kg/day, while those who regressed had doses ≥0.18 mg/kg/day. Graphed means suggested better outcome with lower mg/kg and longer medication duration. Four parents spontaneously reported reduced hyperactivity and irritability and better verbalization and continued mecamylamine at their own expense. Mecamylamine appeared to be safe, but not very effective in autism. The suggestion of better results at lower doses and longer exposure warrants consideration for future trials. The next step would be exploration of a more specific α4β2 nAChR agonist, such as varenicline.","Arnold L Eugene, Aman Michael G, Hollway Jill, Hurt Elizabeth, Bates Bethany, Li Xiaobai, Farmer Cristan, Anand Rene, Thompson Susan, Ramadan Yaser, Williams Craig",Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology,"Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Child, Preschool, Constipation, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Double-Blind Method, Female, Ganglionic Blockers, Humans, Male, Mecamylamine, Pilot Projects, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22537359,"Nisonger Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. l.arnold@osumc.edu"

There is currently no reference treatment or specific pharmacological treatment recommendation on the management of sleep disturbances in children and adolescents suffering from PTSD, despite the fact that they have a significant effect on daytime functioning and overall mental health of children as well as on family's health and quality of life. In this respect, paediatric prolonged-release melatonin (PedPRM) has shown significant beneficial effects on insomnia disorders in children with autism spectrum disorders and positive effects on anxiety and depressive symptomatology. Our study will be the first randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of PedPRM melatonin on sleep disorders in children and adolescents with PTSD, as well as on PTSD symptoms, associated daytime functioning and overall mental health in these children and their caregivers.<b>Methods/design</b>: The MelatoSOM-Kids-PTSD study (French national hospital-based clinical research programme) will be a multi-centre prospective double-blind placebo-controlled parallel group clinical trial investigating the efficacy of paediatric prolonged-release melatonin to alleviate sleep disturbances in children and adolescents with PTSD (120 participants recruited over a 24-month period). The experimental group will be treated with active prolonged-release melatonin over 13 weeks (PedPRM). The control group will receive a placebo. The primary endpoint will be the difference in sleep diary derived total sleep time after 13 weeks of treatment in the PedPRM group versus placebo group. Secondary endpoints will be the differences in objective sleep quality parameters and daytime functioning before and after treatment, in children with PTSD and their caregivers.<b>Discussion</b>: This paper describes the MelatoSOM-Kids-PTSD protocol, which will evaluate the effectiveness of melatonin, a treatment that has already demonstrated an excellent benefit-risk ratio in the paediatric population over 4 years.","Rolling Julie, Reynaud Eve, Mengin Amaury C, Zanfonato Thomas, Bourgin Patrice, Schroder Carmen M",European journal of psychotraumatology,"Adolescent, Child, Female, Humans, Male, Delayed-Action Preparations, Double-Blind Method, Melatonin, Prospective Studies, Quality of Life, Sleep Wake Disorders, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic, Treatment Outcome, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40243149,"Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Strasbourg University Hospitals, Strasbourg, France.; Regional Center for Psychotrauma Great East, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France.; Sleep Disorders Center, International Research Center for ChronoSomnology, Strasbourg University Hospitals, Strasbourg, France."

However, it remains unclear whether physical exercise or melatonin supplement, or a combination of both, is more effective in improving sleep quality in this population. The purpose of this study is to answer this research question by comparing the effectiveness of three types of interventions (physical exercise vs. melatonin supplement or a combination of both) in improving sleep quality in children with ASD. Sixty-two (62) children diagnosed with ASD were randomly assigned to one of four groups: cycling (n = 18), melatonin supplement (n = 14), a combination of both (n = 12), and placebo control group (n = 18). Four (4) sleep parameters (sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, sleep duration, and wake after sleep onset) were assessed. The results revealed a significant improvement in sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, and sleep duration in all of the interventions, but not in the placebo control group.

35120753,10.1016/J.Encep.2021.08.005,[Therapeutic approaches for sleep and rhythms disorders in children with ASD].,2022-06-01,"Sleep disturbances are extremely common (40-86%) in children and adolescents, especially those with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and are often among the first symptoms identified by parents at a very early stage of their child's development. These abnormalities are among the main parental concerns when having a child with ASD and have a significant impact on the quality of life of patients, their parents, and more broadly their siblings. Sleep disorders are essentially abnormalities of the sleep-wake rhythm - primarily sleep onset insomnia or nocturnal awakenings (with difficulty falling back to sleep). These disturbances can be accompanied by other sleep disorders, requiring notably a systematic elimination of the presence of a sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome - to ensure a personalized and efficient therapeutic approach. Physiologically, the determinants of these sleep disorders are poorly understood, even though several studies point to a significant decrease in melatonin synthesis in people with ASD. Melatonin is a hormone that facilitates falling asleep and maintaining sleep and is also involved in the endogenous synchronization of internal biological clocks. However, the causal factors of this decrease in melatonin synthesis are largely unknown, involving to a small extent the genes involved in melatonin synthesis pathway. The treatment of sleep disorders is relatively systematic: after eliminating other specific sleep disorders associated with the complaint of insomnia, as well as other possible associated comorbidities (such as seizures), a global and graduated therapeutic approach must be put in place. This treatment will be non-pharmacological as a first line, then pharmacological as a second line. A number of non-pharmacological treatment strategies for sleep disorders in typically developing children and adolescents, as well as those with ASD, have been shown to be effective. This treatment requires a combination of: 1) parental education to promote sleep development; 2) setting up bedtime rituals adapted to the child's age and particularities; 3) specific behavioral strategies including bedtime fading, gradual extinction and positive reinforcement of adapted behaviors. It is very essential that the parents are accompanied throughout this therapy. Sleep hygiene and behavioral care must also take into consideration the important role of the zeitgebers of sleep-wake rhythms, i.e. the external environmental factors involved in the synchronization of the biological clocks: regular exposure to light at adapted times, regular meal and wake-up times, social activities and times for going to school. The evidence for the effectiveness of behavioral interventions in the treatment of behavioral insomnia in the typical developmental child is strong, since 94% of children show clinically significant improvements in nighttime sleepiness and waking. By contrast, only about 25% of children with ASD are improved by an approach combining sleep hygiene and behavioral therapy. Melatonin has a special and prominent place in the drug management of sleep disorders associated with ASD. Several clinical trials have shown that melatonin is effective in treating sleep disorders in patients with ASD. This work led to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granting marketing authorization in September 2018 for a sustained-release paediatric melatonin molecule (Slenyto®). This synthetic molecule is a prolonged release melatonin (PRM) which mimics the physiological pharmacokinetic and secretory characteristics of endogenous melatonin, having a very short blood half-life and prolonged secretion for several hours during the night. A recent study evaluated the efficacy and safety of pediatric PRM (mini-tablets) in 125 children, aged 2 to 17.5 years with mainly ASD. After 15 days on placebo, the children were randomized into two parallel groups, PRM or placebo in a double-blind design for 13 weeks. At endpoint, total sleep time was increased by an average of 57.5 minutes on PRM and only 9.14 minutes on placebo (P=0.034). This difference between the two groups was already significant after three weeks of treatment (P=0.006). Sleep latency was also improved in the PRM group (-39.6 minutes) compared to placebo (-12.51 minutes) (P=0.01). Consolidated sleep duration (uninterrupted by awakenings) was improved by 77.9 minutes for the PRM group and only 25.4 minutes for the placebo group (P<0.001). PRM was well tolerated, the most frequent side effects being headache and daytime drowsiness at the same level with PRM or placebo. In addition, the acceptability by the children for swallowing the mini-tablets was excellent (100% compliance). The efficacy and tolerability of PRM was maintained over the medium and long term in the open phase, over a total study duration of 2 years.","Schröder C M, Broquère M A, Claustrat B, Delorme R, Franco P, Lecendreux M, Tordjman S",L'Encephale,"Adolescent, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Humans, Melatonin, Quality of Life, Sleep, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders, Sleep Wake Disorders",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35120753,"Centre ressource autisme, hôpital La Grave Place Lange, 31300 Toulouse, France.; Prosom (association nationale de promotion des connaissances du sommeil), 7, place du Griffon, 69001 Lyon, France.; Centre pédiatrique des pathologies du sommeil, hôpital Robert-Debré, 75015 Paris, France; Centre de référence pour la narcolepsie et les hypersomnies idiopathiques et le syndrome de Kleine-Levin (CNR Narcolepsie-Hypersomnie), Paris, France.; Pôle hospitalo-universitaire de psychiatrie de l'enfant et de l'adolescent (PHUPEA), centre hospitalier Guillaume-Régnier (CHGR), université de Rennes 1, Rennes, France; Centre de neurosciences intégratives et cognition (CNIC), CNRS UMR 8002, université de Paris, 75006 Paris, France.; Service de psychiatrie de l'enfant et de l'adolescent, centre d'excellence pour l'autisme et les troubles du neurodéveloppement STRAS&ND, hôpitaux universitaires de Strasbourg, université de Strasbourg, 67000 Strasbourg, France; CNRS UPR 3212, institut des neurosciences cellulaires et intégratives, 67000 Strasbourg, France; Centre des troubles du sommeil, centre international de recherche en chronosomnologie (CIRCSom), hôpitaux universitaires de Strasbourg, 1, place de l'Hôpital, 67000 Strasbourg, France.

One hundred and sixty children with autism spectrum disorders, aged 4-10 years, suffering from sleep onset insomnia and impaired sleep maintenance, were assigned randomly to either (1) combination of controlled-release melatonin and cognitive-behavioural therapy; (2) controlled-release melatonin; (3) four sessions of cognitive-behavioural therapy; or (4) placebo drug treatment condition for 12 weeks in a 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 ratio. Children were studied at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. Treatment response was assessed with 1-week actigraphic monitoring, sleep diary and sleep questionnaire. Main outcome measures, derived actigraphically, were sleep latency, total sleep time, wake after sleep onset and number of awakenings. The active treatment groups all resulted in improvements across all outcome measures, with moderate-to-large effect sizes from baseline to a 12-week assessment. Melatonin treatment was mainly effective in reducing insomnia symptoms, while cognitive-behavioural therapy had a light positive impact mainly on sleep latency, suggesting that some behavioural aspects might play a role in determining initial insomnia. The combination treatment group showed a trend to outperform other active treatment groups, with fewer dropouts and a greater proportion of treatment responders achieving clinically significant changes (63.38% normative sleep efficiency criterion of >85% and 84.62%, sleep onset latency <30 min). This study demonstrates that adding behavioural intervention to melatonin treatment seems to result in a better treatment response, at least in the short term.","Cortesi Flavia, Giannotti Flavia, Sebastiani Teresa, Panunzi Sara, Valente Donatella",Journal of sleep research,"Actigraphy, Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Child, Preschool, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Combined Modality Therapy, Delayed-Action Preparations, Female, Humans, Male, Melatonin, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders, Surveys and Questionnaires, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22616853,"Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Neuropsychiatry, Center of Pediatric Sleep Disorders, University of Rome La Sapienza, Italy. flavia.cortesi@uniroma1.it"

A 4-week, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design was conducted following a 1-week baseline period. Either melatonin, 3 mg, or placebo was given to participants for 2 weeks and then alternated for another 2 weeks. Sleep variables, including sleep duration, sleep-onset time, sleep-onset latency time, and the number of night awakenings, were recorded using an Actiwatch and from sleep diaries completed by parents. All participants had been thoroughly assessed for ASD and also had DNA testing for the diagnosis of FXS. Data were successfully obtained from the 12 of 18 subjects who completed the study (11 males, age range 2 to 15.25 years, mean 5.47, SD 3.6). Five participants met diagnostic criteria for ASD, 3 for FXS alone, 3 for FXS and ASD, and 1 for fragile X premutation. Eight out of 12 had melatonin first. The conclusions from a nonparametric repeated-measures technique indicate that mean night sleep duration was longer on melatonin than placebo by 21 minutes (p = .02), mean sleep-onset latency was shorter by 28 minutes (p = .0001), and mean sleep-onset time was earlier by 42 minutes (p = .02).

This multisite, 4-week, randomized crossover trial compared three dose levels (low, medium, and high) of MPH with placebo. At baseline, the independent evaluator (IE) asked parents to nominate the child's two biggest problems. For each problem, the IE and parent coconstructed a brief narrative of the behavior and the impact on family life. The IE and parents reviewed and revised the narratives at subsequent visits. A panel of four judges, blind to treatment condition, independently reviewed the narratives to rate change from baseline on a 9-point scale: 1, normal; 2, markedly improved; 3, definitely improved; 4, equivocally improved; 5, no change; 6, possibly worse; 7, definitely worse; 8, markedly worse; 9, disastrously worse.

Furthermore, chronic redox imbalance was also recently linked to this disorder. The goal of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility of using oral N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a glutamatergic modulator and an antioxidant, in the treatment of behavioral disturbance in children with autism. This was a 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of NAC in children with autistic disorder. Subjects randomized to NAC were initiated at 900 mg daily for 4 weeks, then 900 mg twice daily for 4 weeks and 900 mg three times daily for 4 weeks. The primary behavioral measure (Aberrant Behavior Checklist [ABC] irritability subscale) and safety measures were performed at baseline and 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Secondary measures included the ABC stereotypy subscale, Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised, and Social Responsiveness Scale. Thirty-three subjects (31 male subjects, 2 female subjects; aged 3.2-10.7 years) were randomized in the study. Follow-up data was available on 14 subjects in the NAC group and 15 in the placebo group. Oral NAC was well tolerated with limited side effects. Compared with placebo, NAC resulted in significant improvements on ABC irritability subscale (F = 6.80; p < .001; d = .96). Data from this pilot investigation support the potential usefulness of NAC for treating irritability in children with autistic disorder.

The behavioural evaluation was conducted using the specific BSE and CARS rating scales NAL treatment produced a significant reduction of the autistic symptomatology in seven (""responders"") out of 12 children. The behavioural improvement was accompanied by alterations in the distribution of the major lymphocyte subsets, with a significant increase of the T-helper-inducers (CD4+CD8-) and a significant reduction of the T-cytotoxic-suppressor (CD4-CD8+) resulting in a normalization of the CD4/CD8 ratio. Changes in natural killer cells and activity were inversely related to plasma beta-endorphin levels. It is suggested that the mechanisms underlying opioid-immune interactions are altered in this population of autistic children and that an immunological screening may have prognostic value for the pharmacological therapy with opiate antagonists.","Scifo R, Cioni M, Nicolosi A, Batticane N, Tirolo C, Testa N, Quattropani M C, Morale M C, Gallo F, Marchetti B",Annali dell'Istituto superiore di sanita,"Adolescent, Antigens, CD, Autistic Disorder, Behavior, Child, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Lymphocyte Subsets, Male, Naltrexone, Narcotic Antagonists, beta-Endorphin",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9028057,"Servizio di Psichiatria, Istituto OASI per lo Studio del Ritardo Mentale e l'Involuzione Cerebrale, Troina (Enna), Italy."

Modest clinical benefits were achieved with both PLC and NTX, with marginally better overall results following NTX, and degree of improvement appeared to be related to plasma chemical profiles. Massively elevated levels of beta-endorphin were observed in all children with assays using C-terminal antibody but not with an N-terminal antibody assay. In addition, 70% of the children exhibited abnormally low levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone, and smaller subsets exhibited elevated norepinephrine (60%), arginine-vasopressin (50%), and serotonin (20%). The best clinical responders exhibited the clearest normalization of the elevated plasma chemistries, especially in C-terminal-beta-endorphin and serotonin. There was some evidence of therapeutic carry-over effects in both clinical and biochemical measures in those children who received NTX before PLC. The results suggest that NTX only benefits a subgroup of autistic children, who may be identified by the presence of certain plasma abnormalities.

8275903,,[Opiate hypothesis in infantile autism? Therapeutic trials with naltrexone].,1993-01-01,"The opioid hypothesis suggests that childhood autism may result from excessive brain opioid activity during neonatal period which may constitutionally inhibit social motivation, yielding autistic isolation and aloofness (Panksepp, 1979). This hypothesis has now received strong support and is currently based on three types of arguments: (1) similarity between autistic symptomatology and abnormal behaviors induced in young animals by injections of exogenous opioids, such as increasing social aloofness and decreasing social vocalization; (2) direct biochemical evidence of abnormalities of peripheral endogenous opioids being reported in autism and (3) therapeutic effects of the long lasting opioid receptor blocking agent naltrexone in autism. In this article, we give description of open and double-blind studies of naltrexone in autism. Naltrexone has been tested in several open studies. We performed an open trial with naltrexone in 2 autistic girls, displaying serious self-injurious behavior, reduced crying and a marked preference for salty and spicy foods, symptoms that could be related to a dysfunction of the opioid system. With dosages of 1 mg/kg/day, we observed an immediate reduction of hyperactivity, self-injurious behavior and aggressiveness, while attention improved. In addition, social behaviors, smiling, social seeking behaviors and play interactions increased (Leboyer, Bouvard et Dugas, 1988). Campbell et al. (1988) has also reported a tranquilizing and a stimulating effect in 6 out of 8 children with autism.

The response to treatment with these nutrients is heterogenous and may be influenced by inflammatory state. As an exploratory analysis, we investigated whether inflammatory state would modulate the effect of these nutrients on core symptoms of ASD. Methods<i>:</i> Seventy-three New Zealand children with ASD (2.5-8.0 years) completed a 12-month randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D (VID, 2000 IU/day), omega-3 LCPUFA; (OM, 722 mg/day docosahexaenoic acid), or both (VIDOM). Non-fasting baseline plasma interleukin-1β (IL-1β) was available for 67 children (VID = 15, OM = 21, VIDOM = 15, placebo = 16). Children were categorised as having undetectable/normal IL-1β (<3.2 pg/ml, <i>n</i>=15) or elevated IL-1β (≥3.2 pg/mL, <i>n</i> = 52). The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) questionnaire was used to assess core symptoms of ASD (baseline, 12-month). Mixed model repeated measure analyses (including all children or only children with elevated IL-1β) were used. We found evidence for an interaction between baseline IL-1β and treatment response for SRS-total, SRS-social communicative functioning, SRS-awareness and SRS-communication (all <i>P</i><sub>interaction</sub> < 0.10). When all children were included in the analysis, two outcome comparisons (treatments vs. placebo) showed greater improvements: VID, no effect (all <i>P</i> > 0.10); OM and VIDOM (<i>P</i> = 0.01) for SRS-awareness. When only children with elevated IL-1β were included, five outcomes showed greater improvements: OM (<i>P</i> = 0.01) for SRS-total; OM (<i>P</i> = 0.03) for SRS-social communicative functioning; VID (<i>P</i> = 0.01), OM (<i>P</i> = 0.003) and VIDOM (<i>P</i> = 0.01) for SRS-awareness.

Because pharmacological treatments may have adverse effects, and despite limited evidence, caregivers/parents often use dietary supplements such as vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids to address these behavioural symptoms. As a secondary objective of the VIDOMA (Vitamin D and Omega-3 in ASD) trial, we evaluated the efficacy of vitamin D, omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid [omega-3 LCPUFA; docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)], or both on irritability and hyperactivity. New Zealand children with ASD (aged 2.5-8 years) participated in a 12-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D (2000 IU/day, VID), omega-3 LCPUFA (722 mg/day DHA, OM), or both (2000 IU/day vitamin D + 722 mg/day DHA, VIDOM). The primary outcomes were the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist (ABC) domains of irritability and hyperactivity.

The objective of this 2 × 2 factorial trial is to investigate the effect of vitamin D, n-3 LCPUFAs or a combination of both on core symptoms of ASD. Children with ASD living in New Zealand (n = 168 children) will be randomised to one of four treatments daily: vitamin D (2000 IU), n-3 LCPUFAs (722 mg DHA), vitamin D (2000 IU) + n-3 LCPUFAs (722 mg DHA) or placebo for 12 months. All researchers, participants and their caregivers will be blinded until the data analysis is completed, and randomisation of the active/placebo capsules and allocation will be fully concealed from all mentioned parties. The primary outcome measures are the change in social-communicative functioning, sensory processing issues and problem behaviours between baseline and 12 months. A secondary outcome measure is the effect on gastrointestinal symptoms. Baseline data will be used to assess and correct basic nutritional deficiencies prior to treatment allocation. For safety measures, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D 25(OH)D and calcium will be monitored at baseline, 6 and 12 months, and weekly compliance and gastrointestinal symptom diaries will be completed by caregivers throughout the study period.

To examine underlying mechanisms underlying the effect of our supplementation regimen, we examined plasma levels of antioxidants transferrin and superoxide dismutase, which are useful markers of signal transduction. The outcome measures were the Social Responsiveness Scale and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community. Repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed that our supplementation regimen significantly improved Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community-measured social withdrawal and Social Responsiveness Scale-measured communication. Treatment effect sizes were more favorable for the treatment group compared with the placebo group (communication: treatment groups, 0.87 vs, placebo, 0.44; social withdrawal: treatment groups, 0.88, vs placebo, 0.54). There was a significant difference in the change in plasma transferrin levels and a trend toward a significant difference in the change in plasma superoxide dismutase levels between the 2 groups.

To date no study has established this. For this study, cheek cell samples from 411 typically developing school children were collected and analysed for PUFA content, in order to establish the range in this population.

Cognitive performance tests were also administered in order to explore whether an association between behaviour and/or cognitive performance and PUFA levels exists. Relationships between PUFA levels and socio-economic status were also explored. Measures of reading, spelling and intelligence did not show any association with PUFA levels, but some associations were noted with the level of omega-3 fatty acids and teacher and parental reports of behaviour, with some evidence that higher omega-3 levels were associated with decreased levels of inattention, hyperactivity, emotional and conduct difficulties and increased levels of prosocial behaviour.

Clinical-behavioral as well as stress-regulatory effects of oxytocin will be evaluated using the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC), the Brief Observation of Social Communication Change (BOSCC) expert rating scale, and measurements of high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), a validated index of parasympathetic autonomic nervous system activity. To assess the possibility of retention and/or late-emerging effects, outcomes will be assessed immediately after the administration regime, and at two follow-up sessions, four-weeks and six months after administration. Significant clinical-behavioral improvements on the ATEC and BOSCC, and significantly higher parasympathetic HF-HRV power in the oxytocin compared to the placebo group would confirm beneficial clinical-behavioral and stress-regulatory effects of oxytocin in autistic children with co-occurring ID. This would also corroborate the use of intermittent dosing schemes in combination with concomitant psychosocial stimulation. The trial was registered on the 9th of December 2022 at the European Clinical Trial Registry (EudraCT 2022-002423-36) and on 20th of September the trial was transferred to the EU Clinical Trial Register (EU CT 2024-513436-14).","Ricchiuti G, Taillieu A, Tuerlinckx E, Prinsen J, Debbaut E, Steyaert J, Boets B, Alaerts Kaat",BMC psychiatry,"Humans, Oxytocin, Child, Double-Blind Method, Intellectual Disability, Child, Preschool, Adolescent, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Male, Female, Stress, Psychological, Administration, Intranasal, Autistic Disorder, Social Behavior",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40033311,"Neuromodulation Laboratory, Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, KU Leuven, Tervuursevest 101, box 1501, 3001, Leuven, Belgium.; Neuromodulation Laboratory, Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, KU Leuven, Tervuursevest 101, box 1501, 3001, Leuven, Belgium. kaat.alaerts@kuleuven.be.; Leuven Autism Research (LAuRes), KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium."

Presently, oxytocin nasal spray has shown significant potential in the treatment of stress-related neuropsychiatric diseases. However, there are few reports on the use of oxytocin nasal spray in postoperative ASD, a condition that can potentially develop into a high-risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorder. This study aims to investigate the effect of pretreatment with oxytocin nasal spray on postoperative ASD in patients with accidental trauma and fracture to provide new clinical insights for the prevention of postoperative ASD. This study is a single-centre, double-blind, randomised controlled clinical trial. The trial aims to recruit 328 patients with accidental traumatic fractures who underwent surgical treatment. Participants will be randomly categorised into two groups: a control group (0.9% normal saline nasal spray, 1 mL) and an oxytocin group (oxytocin nasal spray, 1 mL/40 IU) at a ratio of 1:1 using the random number table method. The primary outcome is the incidence of ASD on postoperative days 1-3. Secondary outcomes include patient resilience, anxiety, depression and pain scores on postoperative days 1-3. The exploratory results include the concentrations of stress response indicators such as malondialdehyde, cortisol and superoxide dismutase in the saliva before the first intervention and on days 1-3 after surgery.

Intranasal administration of oxytocin has been considered a potential therapeutic option for improving social difficulties in autism, either by enhancing the salience of social cues or by reducing the social stress and anxiety experienced in social encounters. We recorded fMRI brain activity while presenting neutral, fearful and scrambled faces, to compare the neural face processing signature of autistic children (n = 58) with that of matched non-autistic controls (n = 38). Next, in the autistic children group, we implemented this fMRI face processing task in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose oxytocin clinical trial, to evaluate the impact of four-week repeated oxytocin administration (24 IU daily dose) on brain activity in face processing regions. No significant diagnostic-group differences were identified between autistic versus non-autistic children with regard to neural face processing. Furthermore, no significant treatment effects were found in the oxytocin clinical trial. However, exploratory analyses (uncorrected for multiple comparisons) demonstrated decreases in brain activity in the left superior temporal sulcus (STS) and inferior frontal region in the oxytocin compared to the placebo group, and change-from-baseline analyses in the oxytocin group revealed significantly reduced neural activity in the core face-processing network (STS, inferior occipital, and posterior fusiform), as well as in amygdala and inferior frontal region.

However, the administration of exogenous OXT in humans produces inconsistent behavioral changes, affecting future consideration of OXT as a treatment for autism and other disorders with social symptoms. Inter-individual variability in social functioning traits might play a key role in how OXT changes brain activity and, therefore, behavior. Here, we investigated if inter-individual variability might dictate how single-dose intranasal OXT administration (IN-OXT) changes spontaneous neural activity during the eyes-open resting state. We used a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over design on 30 typically developing young adult men to investigate the dynamics of EEG microstates corresponding to activity in defined neural networks. We confirmed previous reports that, at the group level, IN-OXT increases the representation of the attention and salience microstates. Furthermore, we identified a decreased representation of microstates associated with the default mode network. Using multivariate partial least square statistical analysis, we found that social functioning traits associated with IN-OXT-induced changes in microstate dynamics in specific spectral bands. Correlation analysis further revealed that the higher the social functioning, the more IN-OXT increased the appearance of the visual network-associated microstate, and suppressed the appearance of a default mode network-related microstate. The lower the social functioning, the more IN-OXT increases the appearance of the salience microstate. The effects we report on the salience microstate support the hypothesis that OXT regulates behavior by enhancing social salience. Moreover, our findings indicate that social functioning traits modulate responses to IN-OXT and could partially explain the inconsistent reports on IN-OXT effects.","Tomescu Miralena I, Van der Donck Stephanie, Perisanu Emanuela M, Berceanu Alexandru I, Alaerts Kaat, Boets Bart, Carcea Ioana",Psychophysiology,"Humans, Oxytocin, Administration, Intranasal, Male, Double-Blind Method, Young Adult, Cross-Over Studies, Adult, Electroencephalography, Social Behavior, Nerve Net",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38594888,"Faculty of Educational Sciences, Department of Psychology, University ""Stefan cel Mare"" of Suceava, Bucharest, Romania.; Center for Developmental Psychiatry, Department of Neurosciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.; CINETic Center, National University of Theatre and Film ""I.L.

During active neural processing, functional integration is facilitated through transitory formations of ""harmonic"" cross-frequency couplings, whereas ""nonharmonic"" decoupling among neural oscillatory rhythms is postulated to characterize the resting, default state of the brain, minimizing the occurrence of spurious, noisy, background couplings. Within this exploratory, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we assessed whether the transient occurrence of nonharmonic and harmonic relationships between peak-frequencies in the alpha (8-14 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) bands is impacted by intranasal administration of oxytocin, a neuromodulator implicated in improving homeostasis and reducing stress/anxiety. To do so, resting-state electroencephalography was acquired before and after 4 weeks of oxytocin administration (12 IU twice-daily) in children with autism spectrum disorder (8-12 years, n = 33 oxytocin; n = 34 placebo). At the baseline, neural assessments of children with autism were compared with those of a matched cohort of children without autism (n = 40). Compared to nonautistic peers, autistic children displayed a lower incidence of nonharmonic alpha-theta cross-frequency decoupling, indicating a higher incidence of spurious ""noisy"" coupling in their resting brain (p = .001). Dimensionally, increased neural coupling was associated with more social difficulties (p = .002) and lower activity of the parasympathetic ""rest & digest"" branch of the autonomic nervous system (p = .018), indexed with high-frequency heart-rate-variability. Notably, after oxytocin administration, the transient formation of nonharmonic cross-frequency configurations was increased in the cohort of autistic children (p < .001), indicating a beneficial effect of oxytocin on reducing spurious cross-frequency-interactions. Furthermore, parallel epigenetics changes of the oxytocin receptor gene indicated that the neural effects were likely mediated by changes in endogenous oxytocinergic signaling (p = .006). Chronic oxytocin induced important homeostatic changes in the resting-state intrinsic neural frequency architecture, reflective of reduced noisy oscillatory couplings and improved signal-to-noise properties.","Alaerts Kaat, Moerkerke Matthijs, Daniels Nicky, Zhang Qianqian, Grazia Ricchiuti, Steyaert Jean, Prinsen Jellina, Boets Bart","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","Humans, Oxytocin, Child, Male, Female, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Administration, Intranasal, Theta Rhythm, Alpha Rhythm, Electroencephalography",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38400592,"Research Group for Neurorehabilitation, Neuromodulation Laboratory, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.; Leuven Autism Research (LAuRes), KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium."

Previous investigations have emphasized the amygdala as the neural foundation for oxytocin's acute effects. However, to fully understand oxytocin's therapeutic potential, it is crucial to gain insight into the neuroplastic changes in amygdala circuitry induced from chronic oxytocin administrations, particularly in pediatric populations. We aimed to examine the impact of a 4-week course of intranasal oxytocin on amygdala functional connectivity in children with autism, compared to placebo. Additionally, we investigated whether oxytocin improves cardiac autonomic arousal, as indexed by high-frequency heart rate variability. Fifty-seven children with autism aged 8-12 years (45 boys, 12 girls) participated in a double-blind, randomized pharmaco-neuroimaging trial involving twice-daily administrations of intranasal oxytocin or placebo. Resting-state fMRI scans and simultaneous, in-scanner heart rate recordings were obtained before, immediately after, and 4 weeks after the nasal spray administration period. Significant reductions in intrinsic amygdala-orbitofrontal connectivity were observed, particularly at the 4-week follow-up session. These reductions were correlated with improved social symptoms and lower cardiac autonomic arousal. Further, oxytocin's neural and cardiac autonomic effects were modulated by epigenetic modifications of the oxytocin receptor gene. The effects were more pronounced in children with reduced epigenetic methylation, signifying heightened expression of the oxytocin receptor. These findings underscore that a 4-week oxytocin administration course decreases amygdala connectivity and improves cardiac autonomic balance.

37278339,10.1111/Jcpp.13850,Can repeated intranasal oxytocin administration affect reduced neural sensitivity towards expressive faces in autism? A randomized controlled trial.,2023-11-01,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by difficulties in social communication and interaction. Crucial for efficient social interaction is the ability to quickly and accurately extract information from a person's face. Frequency-tagging electroencephalography (EEG) is a novel tool to quantify face-processing sensitivity in a robust and implicit manner. In terms of intervention approaches, intranasal administration of oxytocin (OT) is increasingly considered as a potential pharmacological approach for improving socio-communicative difficulties in ASD, through enhancing social salience and/or reducing (social) stress and anxiety. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, mechanistic pharmaco-neuroimaging clinical trial, we implemented frequency-tagging EEG to conduct an exploratory investigation into the impact of repeated OT administration (4 weeks, 12 IU, twice daily) on neural sensitivity towards happy and fearful facial expressions in children with ASD (8-12 years old; OT: n = 29; placebo: n = 32). Neural effects were assessed at baseline, post-nasal spray (24 hr after the last nasal spray) and at a follow-up session, 4 weeks after the OT administration period. At baseline, neural assessments of children with ASD were compared with those of an age- and gender-matched cohort of neurotypical (NT) children (n = 39). Children with ASD demonstrated reduced neural sensitivity towards expressive faces, as compared to NT children. Upon nasal spray administration, children with ASD displayed a significant increase in neural sensitivity at the post- and follow-up sessions, but only in the placebo group, likely reflecting an implicit learning effect. Strikingly, in the OT group, neural sensitivity remained unaffected from the baseline to the post-session, likely reflecting a dampening of an otherwise typically occurring implicit learning effect. First, we validated the robustness of the frequency-tagging EEG approach to assess reduced neural sensitivity towards expressive faces in children with ASD. Furthermore, in contrast to social salience effects observed after single-dose administrations, repeated OT administration dampened typically occurring learning effects in neural sensitivity. In line with OT's social anxiolytic account, these observations possibly reflect a predominant (social) stress regulatory effect towards emotionally evocative faces after repeated OT administration.","Moerkerke Matthijs, Daniels Nicky, Van der Donck Stephanie, Tibermont Laura, Tang Tiffany, Debbaut Edward, Bamps Annelies, Prinsen Jellina, Steyaert Jean, Alaerts Kaat, Boets Bart","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","Child, Humans, Autistic Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Oxytocin, Administration, Intranasal, Nasal Sprays, Double-Blind Method",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37278339,"Center for Developmental Psychiatry, Department of Neurosciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.; Leuven Autism Research (LAuRes), KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium."

We have previously shown that intranasal administration of oxytocin facilitates the pleasantness of social touch and activation of brain reward and social processing regions, although it is unclear if it influences responses to gentle stroking touch mediated by cutaneous C-touch fibers or pressure touch mediated by other types of fibers. Additionally, it is unclear whether endogenous oxytocin acts via direct entry into the brain or by increased peripheral blood concentrations. In a randomized controlled design, we compared effects of intranasal (direct entry into the brain and increased peripheral concentrations) and oral (only peripheral increases) oxytocin on behavioral and neural responses to social touch targeting C-touch (gentle-stroking) or other (medium pressure without stroking) cutaneous receptors. Although both types of touch were perceived as pleasant, intranasal and oral oxytocin equivalently enhanced pleasantness ratings and responses of reward, orbitofrontal cortex, and social processing, superior temporal sulcus, regions only to gentle-stroking not medium pressure touch. Furthermore, increased blood oxytocin concentrations predicted the pleasantness of gentle stroking touch. The specificity of neural effects of oxytocin on C-touch targeted gentle stroking touch were confirmed by time-course extraction and classification analysis. Increased peripheral concentrations of oxytocin primarily modulate its behavioral and neural responses to gentle social touch mediated by C-touch fibers.

Effects of oxytocin were assessed immediately after the administration period and at a follow-up, 4 weeks after the last administration. The double-blind phase was followed by a 4-week single-blind phase during which all participants received intranasal oxytocin. In the double-blind phase, both the oxytocin and placebo group displayed significant pre-to-post-improvements in social responsiveness and secondary questionnaires, but improvements were not specific to the intranasal oxytocin. Notably, in the single-blind phase, participants who were first allocated to intranasal placebo and later changed to intranasal oxytocin displayed a significant improvement in social responsiveness, over and above the placebo-induced improvements noted in the first phase. Participants receiving oxytocin in the first phase also showed a significant further improvement upon receiving a second course of oxytocin, but only at the 4-week follow-up. Further, exploratory moderator analyses indicated that children who received psychosocial trainings (3 or more sessions per month) along with oxytocin administration displayed a more pronounced improvement in social responsiveness. Future studies using larger cohorts and more explicitly controlled concurrent psychosocial trainings are warranted to further explore the preliminary moderator effects, also including understudied populations within the autism spectrum, such as children with co-occurring intellectual disabilities.

Overall, there was no effect of oxytocin treatment over time on the caregiver-rated Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2) (p = 0.686). However, a significant interaction with age (p = 0.028) showed that for younger children, aged 3-5 years, there was some indication of a treatment effect. Younger children who received oxytocin showed improvement on caregiver-rated social responsiveness ( SRS-2). There was no other evidence of benefit in the sample as a whole, or in the younger age group, on the clinician-rated Clinical Global Improvement Scale (CGI-S), or any secondary measure. Importantly, placebo effects in the lead-in phase were evident and there was support for washout of the placebo response in the randomised phase. Oxytocin was well tolerated, with more adverse side effects reported in the placebo group. This study suggests the need for further clinical trials to test the benefits of oxytocin treatment in younger populations with autism.Trial registration www.anzctr.org.au (ACTRN12617000441314).","Guastella Adam J, Boulton Kelsie A, Whitehouse Andrew J O, Song Yun Ju, Thapa Rinku, Gregory Simon G, Pokorski Izabella, Granich Joanna, DeMayo Marilena M, Ambarchi Zahava, Wray John, Thomas Emma E, Hickie Ian B",Molecular psychiatry,"Child, Child, Preschool, Humans, Administration, Intranasal, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Double-Blind Method, Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions, Nasal Sprays, Oxytocin, Social Interaction, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36302965,"Child and Adolescent Health Service, Child Development Service, West Perth, WA, Australia.; Clinic for Autism and Neurodevelopment (CAN) Research, Brain and Mind Centre, Children's Hospital Westmead Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.; Department of Neurology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC, USA.; Clinic for Autism and Neurodevelopment (CAN) Research, Brain and Mind Centre, Children's Hospital Westmead Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW, Australia. adam.guastella@sydney.edu.au.; Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia."

However, a gap persists in the literature regarding the potential effects of OT and the neural temporal dynamics due to OT administration. We explored the effect of OT on autistic individuals using magnetoencephalography (MEG), focusing on M100, M170, and M250, social perception-related components that tend to show atypical patterns in autistic individuals. Twenty-five autistic adolescents participated in this randomized, double-blind MEG study. Autistic individuals arrived at the lab twice and received an acute dose of intranasal OT or placebo in each session. During the scans, participants were asked to identify pictures of social and non-social stimuli. Additionally, 23 typically developing (TD) adolescents performed the same task in the MEG as a benchmark that allowed us to better characterize neural regions of interest and behavioral results for this age group in this task. A source-model beamformer analysis revealed that OT enhanced neural activity for social stimuli in frontal regions during M170. Additionally, in each of the preselected time windows, OT increased activation in the left hemisphere, regardless of the content of the presented stimuli. We suggest that OT increased the processing of social stimuli through two separate mechanisms. First, OT increased neural activity in a nonspecific manner, allowing increased allocation of attention toward the stimuli. Second, OT enhanced M170 activity in frontal regions only in response to social stimuli. These results reveal the temporal dynamics of the effects of OT on the early stages of social and non-social perception in autistic adolescents.Trial registration: This study was a part of a project registered as clinical trial October 27th, 2021.

36127337,10.1038/S41398-022-02158-8,Effects of single- and multiple-dose oxytocin treatment on amygdala low-frequency BOLD fluctuations and BOLD spectral dynamics in autism.,2022-09-20,"Prior neuroimaging clinical trials investigating the neural effects of intranasal administration of the neuropeptide oxytocin demonstrated a key role of the amygdala in oxytocin's neuromodulatory effects. These studies mostly demonstrated the acute effects of single-dose administrations, examining task-dependent effects of oxytocin on brain activity elicited during explicit experimental tasks or stimuli presentations. The increased consideration of oxytocin as a potential ameliorating treatment in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) requires a better understanding of how multiple-dose oxytocin administration affects intrinsic, task-free, amygdala function. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with between-subject design, 38 adult men with ASD underwent resting-state fMRI scanning before and after oxytocin or placebo treatment. Effects were assessed either after a single-dose administration, consisting of 24 international units, or after multiple-dose treatment, consisting of 4 weeks of once-daily nasal spray administrations. Compared to placebo, oxytocin induced a decrease in intrinsic resting-state BOLD signal amplitudes of the bilateral amygdala (fractional amplitudes of low-frequency fluctuations) and modulated cross-frequency interactions between adjacent BOLD frequency components. The right amygdala showed a pattern of reduced cross-frequency harmonicity, while the left amygdala showed a relative increase in harmonic cross-frequency interactions after oxytocin treatment. Notably, the direction and magnitude of BOLD spectral changes induced after a single-dose were qualitatively similar to treatment effects induced after multiple-dose treatment. Furthermore, the identified spectral changes in amygdalar BOLD amplitude and cross-frequency harmonicity were associated with improved feelings of tension, reflecting oxytocin's anxiolytic, stress-reducing neuromodulatory role. The observed effects of oxytocin on amygdalar BOLD spectral characteristics and associated behaviors contribute to a deeper mechanistic understanding of the intrinsic, task-free neuromodulatory dynamics that underlie single- and multiple-dose oxytocin treatment in ASD.

36064612,10.1186/S13229-022-00513-6,Oxytocin impacts top-down and bottom-up social perception in adolescents with ASD: a MEG study of neural connectivity.,2022-09-05,"In the last decade, accumulative evidence has shown that oxytocin can modulate social perception in typically developed individuals and individuals diagnosed with autism. While several studies show that oxytocin (OT) modulates neural activation in social-related neural regions, the mechanism that underlies OT effects in ASD is not fully known yet. Despite evidence from animal studies on connections between the oxytocinergic system and excitation/inhibition neural balance, the influence of OT on oscillatory responses among individuals with ASD has been rarely examined. To bridge these gaps in knowledge, we investigated the effects of OT on both social and non-social stimuli while focusing on its specific influence on the neural connectivity between three socially related neural regions-the left and right fusiform and the medial frontal cortex. Twenty-five adolescents with ASD participated in a wall-established social task during a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled MEG and OT administration study. Our main task was a social-related task that required the identification of social and non-social-related pictures. We hypothesized that OT would modulate the oscillatory connectivity between three pre-selected regions of interest to be more adaptive to social processing. Specifically, we focused on alpha and gamma bands which are known to play an important role in face processing and top-down/bottom-up balance. Compared to placebo, OT reduced the connectivity between the medial frontal cortex and the fusiform in the low gamma more for social stimuli than for non-social ones, a reduction that was correlated with individuals' performance in the task. Additionally, for both social and non-social stimuli, OT increased the connectivity in the alpha and beta bands. Sample size was determined based on sample sizes previously reported in MEG in clinical populations, especially OT administration studies in combination with neuroimaging in ASD. We were limited in our capability to recruit for such a study, and as such, the sample size was not based on a priori power analysis. Additionally, we limited our analyses to specific neural bands and regions. To validate the current results, future studies may be needed to explore other parameters using whole-brain approaches in larger samples. These results suggest that OT influenced social perception by modifying the communication between frontal and posterior regions, an attenuation that potentially impacts both social and non-social early perception. We also show that OT influences differ between top-down and bottom-up processes, depending on the social context. Overall, by showing that OT influences both social-related perception and overall attention during early processing stages, we add new information to the existing understanding of the impact of OT on neural processing in ASD. Furthermore, by highlighting the influence of OT on early perception, we provide new directions for treatments for difficulties in early attentional phases in this population.

Intranasal administration of OXT is widely used to examine the drug's functional effects in both adults and children and is assumed to enter the brain directly via this route. However, OXT can also influence brain function through increased blood concentrations, and we have recently shown that orally (lingual) administered OXT also modulates neural responses to emotional faces and may be better tolerated for therapeutic use. Here, we examine whether 24 IU OXT administered orally can facilitate social attention. In a randomized, placebo-controlled pharmacologic study, we used a validated emotional antisaccade eye-tracking paradigm to explore the effects of oral OXT on bottom-up and top-down attention processing in 80 healthy male participants. Our findings showed that in terms of top-down attention, oral OXT increased errors for both social (angry, fearful, happy, sad, and neutral emotion faces) and nonsocial stimuli (oval shapes) in the antisaccade condition but increased response latencies only in the social condition. It also significantly reduced post-task state anxiety, but this reduction was not correlated with task performance. A comparison with our previous intranasal OXT study using the same task revealed that both routes have a similar effect on increasing antisaccade errors and response latencies and on reducing state anxiety. Overall, our findings suggest that oral administration of OXT produces similar effects on top-down social attention control and anxiety to intranasal administration and may therefore have therapeutic utility.","Zhuang Qian, Zheng Xiaoxiao, Yao Shuxia, Zhao Weihua, Becker Benjamin, Xu Xiaolei, Kendrick Keith M",The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology,"Adult, Child, Male, Humans, Oxytocin, Administration, Intranasal, Facial Expression, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Double-Blind Method, Attention, Administration, Oral",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36053298,"The Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, MOE Key Laboratory for Neuroinformation, Center for Information in Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China."

Carboxyhemoglobin (SpCO) as a non-invasive measurement of inflammation has not been studied in individuals with ASD. We conducted this post-hoc study based on our published clinical trial to explore SpCO and its association with ASD severity, autoimmunity, and response to daily Lactobacillus plantarum probiotic supplementation. In this study, we included 35 individuals with ASD aged 3-20 years from a previously published clinical trial of the probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive daily Lactobacillus plantarum probiotic (6 × 10<sup>10</sup> CFUs) or a placebo for 16 weeks. The outcomes in this analysis include Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), Aberrant Behavior Checklist second edition (ABC-2), Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, SpCO measured by CO-oximetry, fecal microbiome by 16 s rRNA sequencing, blood serum inflammatory markers, autoantibodies, and oxytocin (OT) by ELISA. We performed Kendall's correlation to examine their interrelationships and used Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare the means of all outcomes between the two groups at baseline and 16 weeks. Elevated levels of serum anti-tubulin, CaM kinase II, anti-dopamine receptor D1 (anti-D1), and SpCO were found in the majority of ASD subjects. ASD severity is correlated with SpCO (baseline, R = 0.38, p = 0.029), anti-lysoganglioside GM1 (R = 0.83, p = 0.022), anti-tubulin (R = 0.69, p = 0.042), and anti-D1 (R = 0.71, p = 0.045) in treatment group. The findings of the present study suggests that the easily administered and non-invasive SpCO test offers a potentially promising autoimmunity and inflammatory biomarker to screen/subgroup ASD and monitor the treatment response to probiotics. Furthermore, we propose that the associations between autoantibodies, gut microbiome profile, serum OT level, GI symptom severity, and ASD core symptom severity scores are specific to the usage of probiotic treatment in our subject cohort. Taken together, these results warrant further studies to improve ASD early diagnosis and treatment outcomes.

Previous trials investigating effects of daily intranasal oxytocin treatment have reported inconsistent results and have not combined it with positive social interaction. However, in two preclinical studies we established that treatment every other day rather than daily is more efficacious in maintaining neural and behavioral effects by reducing receptor desensitization. We aimed to establish whether a 6-week intranasal oxytocin compared with placebo treatment, followed by a period of positive social interaction, would produce reliable symptom improvements in children with ASD. A pilot double-blind, randomized, crossover design trial was completed including 41 children with ASD aged 3-8 years. Primary outcomes were the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 (ADOS-2) and social responsivity scale-2 (SRS-2). Secondary measures included cognitive, autism- and caregiver-related questionnaires, and social attention assessed using eye-tracking. Significant improvements were found for oxytocin relative to placebo in primary outcome measures (total ADOS-2 and SRS-2 scores, ps < 0.001) and in behavioral adaptability and repetitive behavior secondary measures. Altered SRS-2 scores were associated with increased saliva oxytocin concentrations. Additionally, oxytocin significantly increased time spent viewing dynamic social compared to geometric stimuli and the eyes of angry, happy, and neutral expression faces. There were no adverse side effects of oxytocin treatment. Overall, results demonstrate that a 6-week intranasal oxytocin treatment administered every other day and followed by positive social interactions can improve clinical, eye tracking, and questionnaire-based assessments of symptoms in young autistic children.","Le Jiao, Zhang Lan, Zhao Weihua, Zhu Siyu, Lan Chunmei, Kou Juan, Zhang Qianqian, Zhang Yingying, Li Qin, Chen Zhuo, Fu Meina, Montag Christian, Zhang Rong, Yang Wenxu, Becker Benjamin, Kendrick Keith M",Psychotherapy and psychosomatics,"Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Child, Double-Blind Method, Humans, Oxytocin, Pilot Projects, Social Interaction",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35545057,"Chengdu Women's and Children's Central Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.; Department of Molecular Psychology, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.; Neuroscience Research Institute, Peking University, Beijing, China.; The Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, MOE Key Laboratory for Neuroinformation, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China."
35067719,10.1093/Brain/Awab291,Effect of a novel nasal oxytocin spray with enhanced bioavailability on autism: a randomized trial.,2022-04-18,"Although intranasal oxytocin is expected to be a novel therapy for the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, which has currently no approved medication, the efficacy of repeated administrations was inconsistent, suggesting that the optimal dose for a single administration of oxytocin is not optimal for repeated administration. The current double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, crossover trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03466671) was aimed to test the effect of TTA-121, a new formulation of intranasal oxytocin spray with an enhanced bioavailability (3.6 times higher than Syntocinon® spray, as assessed by area under the concentration-time curve in rabbit brains), which enabled us to test a wide range of multiple doses, on autism spectrum disorder core symptoms and to determine the dose-response relationship. Four-week administrations of TTA-121, at low dose once per day (3 U/day), low dose twice per day (6 U/day), high dose once per day (10 U/day), or high dose twice per day (20 U/day), and 4-week placebo were administered in a crossover manner. The primary outcome was the mean difference in the reciprocity score (range: 0-14, higher values represent worse outcomes) on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule between the baseline and end point of each administration period. This trial with two administration periods and eight groups was conducted at seven university hospitals in Japan, enrolling adult males with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder. Enrolment began from June 2018 and ended December 2019. Follow-up ended March 2020. Of 109 males with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder who were randomized, 103 completed the trial. The smallest P-value, judged as the dose-response relationship, was the contrast with the peak at TTA-121 6 U/day, with inverted U-shape for both the full analysis set (P = 0.182) and per protocol set (P = 0.073). The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule reciprocity score, the primary outcome, was reduced in the TTA-121 6 U/day administration period compared with the placebo (full analysis set: P = 0.118, mean difference = -0.5; 95% CI: -1.1 to 0.1; per protocol set: P = 0.012, mean difference = -0.8; 95% CI: -1.3 to -0.2). The per protocol set was the analysis target population, consisting of all full analysis set participants except those who deviated from the protocol. Most dropouts from the full analysis set to the per protocol set occurred because of poor adherence to the test drug (9 of 12 in the first period and 8 of 15 in the second period). None of the secondary clinical and behavioural outcomes were significantly improved with the TTA-121 compared with the placebo in the full analysis set. A novel intranasal spray of oxytocin with enhanced bioavailability enabled us to test a wide range of multiple doses, revealing an inverted U-shape dose-response curve, with the peak at a dose that was lower than expected from previous studies. The efficacy of TTA-121 shown in the current exploratory study should be verified in a future large-scale, parallel-group trial.","Yamasue Hidenori, Kojima Masaki, Kuwabara Hitoshi, Kuroda Miho, Matsumoto Kaori, Kanai Chieko, Inada Naoko, Owada Keiho, Ochi Keiko, Ono Nobutaka, Benner Seico, Wakuda Tomoyasu, Kameno Yosuke, Inoue Jun, Harada Taeko, Tsuchiya Kenji, Umemura Kazuo, Yamauchi Aya, Ogawa Nanayo, Kushima Itaru, Ozaki Norio, Suyama Satoshi, Saito Takuya, Uemura Yukari, Hamada Junko, Kano Yukiko, Honda Nami, Kikuchi Saya, Seto Moe, Tomita Hiroaki, Miyoshi Noriko, Matsumoto Megumi, Kawaguchi Yuko, Kanai Koji, Ikeda Manabu, Nakamura Itta, Isomura Shuichi, Hirano Yoji, Onitsuka Toshiaki, Kosaka Hirotaka, Okada Takashi",Brain : a journal of neurology,"Administration, Intranasal, Animals, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Biological Availability, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Nasal Sprays, Oxytocin, Rabbits, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35067719,"Department of Pharmacology, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashiku, Hamamatsu City 431-3192, Japan.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashiku, Hamamatsu City 431-3192, Japan.; Child Development and Education, Faculty of Humanities, Wayo Women's University, Konodai 2-3-1, Ichikawa, Chiba 272-0827, Japan.; Department of Child Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.; Department of Psychology, Faculty of Liberal Arts, Teikyo University, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Psychiatry, Graduate School of Medicine, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.; Graduate School of Psychology, Kanazawa Institute of Technology, 7-1 Ohgigaoka, Nonoichi 921-8054, Japan.; Department of Neuropsychiatry, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, Eiheiji, Fukui 910-1193, Japan.; Department of Psychiatry, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashiku, Hamamatsu City 431-3192, Japan.; Department of Medical Technique, Nagoya University Hospital, 65 Tsurumai-cho, Showa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi 466-8560, Japan.; Biostatistics Section, Department of Data Science, Center for Clinical Science, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Shinjyu-ku, Tokyo 162-8655, Japan.; Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.; Department of Psychiatry, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, 65 Tsurumai-cho, Showa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi 466-8550, Japan.; School of Media Science, Tokyo University of Technology, Hachioji, Japan.; Department of Psychiatry, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.; Department of Computer Science, Graduate School of Systems Design, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Hino, Japan.; Department of Child Development, United Graduate School of Child Development at Hamamatsu, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashiku, Hamamatsu 431-3192, Japan.; Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan."

Oxytocin has been administered in clinical practice to many children with autism spectrum disorder. We conducted a 24-week, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial of intranasal oxytocin therapy in children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with autism spectrum disorder. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, with stratification according to age and verbal fluency, to receive oxytocin or placebo, administered intranasally, with a total target dose of 48 international units daily. The primary outcome was the least-squares mean change from baseline on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist modified Social Withdrawal subscale (ABC-mSW), which includes 13 items (scores range from 0 to 39, with higher scores indicating less social interaction). Secondary outcomes included two additional measures of social function and an abbreviated measure of IQ. Of the 355 children and adolescents who underwent screening, 290 were enrolled. A total of 146 participants were assigned to the oxytocin group and 144 to the placebo group; 139 and 138 participants, respectively, completed both the baseline and at least one postbaseline ABC-mSW assessments and were included in the modified intention-to-treat analyses. The least-squares mean change from baseline in the ABC-mSW score (primary outcome) was -3.7 in the oxytocin group and -3.5 in the placebo group (least-squares mean difference, -0.2; 95% confidence interval, -1.5 to 1.0; P = 0.61). Secondary outcomes generally did not differ between the trial groups. The incidence and severity of adverse events were similar in the two groups.

34593045,10.1186/S13229-021-00459-1,A randomized controlled trial of intranasal oxytocin in Phelan-McDermid syndrome.,2021-09-30,"Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by haploinsufficiency of the SHANK3 gene and characterized by global developmental delays, deficits in speech and motor function, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Monogenic causes of ASD such as PMS are well suited to investigations with novel therapeutics, as interventions can be targeted based on established genetic etiology. While preclinical studies have demonstrated that the neuropeptide oxytocin can reverse electrophysiological, attentional, and social recognition memory deficits in Shank3-deficient rats, there have been no trials in individuals with PMS. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of intranasal oxytocin as a treatment for the core symptoms of ASD in a cohort of children with PMS. Eighteen children aged 5-17 with PMS were enrolled. Participants were randomized to receive intranasal oxytocin or placebo (intranasal saline) and underwent treatment during a 12-week double-blind, parallel group phase, followed by a 12-week open-label extension phase during which all participants received oxytocin. Efficacy was assessed using the primary outcome of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Social Withdrawal (ABC-SW) subscale as well as a number of secondary outcome measures related to the core symptoms of ASD. Safety was monitored throughout the study period.

Oxytocin was generally well tolerated, and there were no serious adverse events. The small sample size, potential challenges with drug administration, and expectancy bias due to relying on parent reported outcome measures may all contribute to limitations in interpreting results.

In particular, while numerous studies have demonstrated effects of oxytocin in promoting social attention the role of AVP has not been examined. The present study employed a randomized, double-blind, placebo (PLC)-controlled between-subject design to explore the social- and emotion-specific effects of AVP on both bottom-up and top-down attention processing with a validated emotional anti-saccade eye-tracking paradigm in 80 healthy male subjects (PLC = 40, AVP = 40). Our findings showed that AVP increased the error rate for social (angry, fearful, happy, neutral and sad faces) but not non-social (oval shapes) stimuli during the anti-saccade condition and reduced error rates in the pro-saccade condition. Comparison of these findings with a previous study (sample size: PLC = 33, OXT = 33) using intranasal oxytocin revealed similar effects of the two peptides on anti-saccade errors, although with some difference in effects of specific face emotions, but a significantly greater effect of AVP on pro-saccades. Both peptides also produced a post-task anxiolytic effect by reducing state anxiety. Together these findings suggested that both AVP and OXT decrease goal-directed top-down attention control to social salient stimuli but that AVP more potently increased bottom-up social attentional processing.","Zhuang Qian, Zheng Xiaoxiao, Becker Benjamin, Lei Wei, Xu Xiaolei, Kendrick Keith M",Psychoneuroendocrinology,"Administration, Intranasal, Arginine Vasopressin, Attention, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Humans, Male, Oxytocin",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34537624,"The Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, MOE Key Laboratory for Neuroinformation, Center for Information in Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, No. 2006, Xiyuan Ave., West Hi-Tech Zone, Chengdu 611761, Sichuan, China.

Current perspectives on the neuroendocrine substrates of this behavioral regulation highlight a role of the peptide hormone oxytocin (OXT), but it remains unclear whether the facilitating effects of OXT vary as a function of facial familiarity. Here, a total of 73 healthy participants was enrolled in an eye-tracking experiment specifically designed to test whether intranasal OXT (24 IU) augments gaze duration toward the eye-region across four different face categories: the participants' own face, the face of their romantic partner, the face of a familiar person (close friend) or an unfamiliar person (a stranger). We found that OXT treatment induced a tendency to spend more time looking into the eyes of familiar persons (partner and close friend) as compared to placebo. This effect was not evident in the self and unfamiliar conditions. Independent of treatment, volunteers scoring high on autistic-like traits (AQ-high) spent less time looking at the eyes of all faces except their partner. Collectively, our results show that the OXT system is involved in facilitating an attentional bias towards the eye region of familiar faces, which convey safety and support, especially in anxious contexts. In contrast, autistic-like traits were associated with reduced attention to the eye region of a face regardless of familiarity and OXT-treatment.","Marsh Nina, Scheele Dirk, Postin Danilo, Onken Marc, Hurlemann Rene",Frontiers in endocrinology,"Administration, Intranasal, Attention, Attitude, Autistic Disorder, Eye-Tracking Technology, Face, Female, Humans, Male, Oxytocin, Personality, Recognition, Psychology, Saliva, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34079520,"Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Carl von Ossietzky University Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany."

However, previous results on the efficacy of repeated administrations of oxytocin are controversial. Recently, we reported time-course changes in the efficacy of the neuropeptide underlying the controversial effects of repeated administration; however, the underlying mechanisms remained unknown. The current study explored metabolites representing the molecular mechanisms of oxytocin's efficacy using high-throughput metabolomics analysis on plasma collected before and after 6-week repeated intranasal administration of oxytocin (48 IU/day) or placebo in adult males with ASD (N = 106) who participated in a multi-center, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial. Among the 35 metabolites measured, a significant increase in N,N-dimethylglycine was detected in the subjects administered oxytocin compared with those given placebo at a medium effect size (false discovery rate (FDR) corrected P = 0.043, d = 0.74, N = 83). Furthermore, subgroup analyses of the participants displaying a prominent time-course change in oxytocin efficacy revealed a significant effect of oxytocin on N,N-dimethylglycine levels with a large effect size (P<sub>FDR</sub> = 0.004, d = 1.13, N = 60). The increase in N,N-dimethylglycine was significantly correlated with oxytocin-induced clinical changes, assessed as changes in quantifiable characteristics of autistic facial expression, including both of improvements between baseline and 2 weeks (P<sub>FDR</sub> = 0.006, r = - 0.485, N = 43) and deteriorations between 2 and 4 weeks (P<sub>FDR</sub> = 0.032, r = 0.415, N = 37). The metabolites changes caused by oxytocin administration were quantified using peripheral blood and therefore may not directly reflect central nervous system changes. Our findings demonstrate an association of N,N-dimethylglycine upregulation with the time-course change in the efficacy of oxytocin on autistic social deficits.

However, no studies have systematically investigated the effects of oxytocin on dynamic or directional aspects of functional connectivity. The present study employed a novel computational framework to investigate these latter aspects in 15 oxytocin-sensitive regions using data from randomized placebo-controlled between-subject resting state functional MRI studies incorporating 200 healthy subjects. In order to characterize the temporal dynamics, the 'temporal state' was defined as a temporal segment of the whole functional MRI signal which exhibited a similar functional interaction pattern among brain regions of interest. Results showed that while no significant effects of oxytocin were found on brain temporal state related characteristics (including temporal state switching frequency, probability of transitions between neighboring states, and averaged dwell time on each state) oxytocin extensively (n = 54 links) modulated effective connectivity among the 15 regions. The effects of oxytocin were primarily characterized by increased effective connectivity both between and within emotion, reward, salience, attention and social cognition processing networks and their interactions with the default mode network. Top-down control over emotional processing regions such as the amygdala was particularly affected. Oxytocin also increased effective homotopic interhemispheric connectivity in almost all these regions. Additionally, the effects of oxytocin on effective connectivity were sex-dependent, being more extensive in males. Overall, these findings suggest that modulatory effects of oxytocin on both within- and between-network interactions may underlie its functional influence on social-emotional behaviors, although in a sex-dependent manner. These findings may be of particular relevance to potential therapeutic use of oxytocin in psychiatric disorders associated with social dysfunction, such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, where directionality of treatment effects on causal interactions between networks may be of key importance .","Jiang Xi, Ma Xiaole, Geng Yayuan, Zhao Zhiying, Zhou Feng, Zhao Weihua, Yao Shuxia, Yang Shimin, Zhao Zhongbo, Becker Benjamin, Kendrick Keith M",NeuroImage,"Adult, Brain, Brain Mapping, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Image Processing, Computer-Assisted, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Nerve Net, Neural Pathways, Oxytocin, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33359350,"The Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, MOE Key Lab for Neuroinformation, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.

In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study with between-subject design, 34 adult men with ASD were either assigned to a four-week treatment of once-daily intranasal OT administrations (24 IU) or placebo. Salivary OT samples were obtained before and after the treatment period as well as at two follow-up sessions, four weeks and one year after cessation of the treatment. Receiving OT intranasally but not placebo reliably increased endogenous salivary levels of OT immediately post-treatment and at the follow-up session four weeks post treatment, indicating an interaction between exogenously administered OT and its endogenous production. Notably, increases in salivary OT at the four-week follow-up session were most pronounced in individuals with larger behavioral improvements in ASD social symptoms. These results suggest that OT's positive effects on social behaviors may lead to a self-perpetuating elevation of OT levels through a feed-forward triggering of its own release. Together, the current investigation provides initial evidence that repeated intranasal administration of OT can induce long-lasting changes in endogenous salivary OT levels, presumably through a positive spiral of OT release.","Alaerts Kaat, Steyaert Jean, Vanaudenaerde Bart, Wenderoth Nicole, Bernaerts Sylvie",European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology,"Administration, Intranasal, Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Double-Blind Method, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Oxytocin",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33309460,"University of Leuven, KU Leuven, Belgium, Department of Neurosciences, Group Biomedical Sciences, Psychiatry Research Group, Belgium; Leuven Autism Research Consortium, KU Leuven, Belgium.; University of Leuven, KU Leuven, Belgium, Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Group Biomedical Sciences, Neurorehabilitation Research Group, Belgium; Leuven Autism Research Consortium, KU Leuven, Belgium.; ETH Zurich, Switzerland, Department of Health Sciences and Technology, Neural Control of Movement Lab, Switzerland.; University of Leuven, KU Leuven, Belgium, Department of Chronic Diseases, Metabolism and Ageing, Group Biomedical Sciences, Pneumology Research Group, Belgium.; University of Leuven, KU Leuven, Belgium, Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Group Biomedical Sciences, Neurorehabilitation Research Group, Belgium; Leuven Autism Research Consortium, KU Leuven, Belgium.

Thirty-eight adult men with ASD (aged between 18 and 35 years) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging of the posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTS) and amygdala regions while processing emotional states from point-light biological motion. In line with prior research, a single dose of IN-OT induced a reliable increase in pSTS brain activity during the processing of point-light biological motion, but no consistent long-term changes in pSTS activity were induced after the multiple-dose treatment. In terms of bilateral amygdala, the multiple-dose treatment induced a consistent attenuation in brain activity, which outlasted the period of actual administrations until four weeks and one year post-treatment. Critically, participants with stronger attenuations in amygdala-activity showed greater behavioral improvements, particularly in terms of self-reported feelings of avoidant attachment and social functioning. Together, these observations provide initial insights into the long-lasting neural consequences of chronic IN-OT use on amygdala functioning and provide first indications that the acute versus chronic effects of IN-OT administration may be qualitatively different.

We conducted a combined behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study to investigate voice-identity recognition following intranasal administration of oxytocin or placebo in a group of adults diagnosed with ASD (full-scale intelligence quotient > 85) and pairwise-matched typically developing (TD) controls. A single dose of 24 IU oxytocin was administered in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and cross-over design. In the control group, but not in the ASD group, administration of oxytocin compared to placebo increased responses to recognition of voice identity in contrast to speech in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus/gyrus (pSTS/G) - a region implicated in the perceptual analysis of voice-identity information. In the ASD group, the right pSTS/G responses were positively correlated with voice-identity recognition accuracy in the oxytocin condition, but not in the placebo condition. Oxytocin did not improve voice-identity recognition performance at the group level. The ASD compared to the control group had lower right pSTS/G responses to voice-identity recognition. Since ASD is known to have atypical pSTS/G, the results indicate that the potential of intranasal oxytocin to enhance mechanisms for voice-identity recognition might be variable and dependent on the functional integrity of this brain region.","Borowiak Kamila, von Kriegstein Katharina",Translational psychiatry,"Administration, Intranasal, Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Brain, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Humans, Identity Recognition, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Oxytocin",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32636360,"Technische Universität Dresden, Bamberger Straße 7, 01187, Dresden, Germany.; Technische Universität Dresden, Bamberger Straße 7, 01187, Dresden, Germany. kamila.borowiak@tu-dresden.de."

The need to consider multi-hormone interactions is particularly warranted in oxytocin trials for autism due to evidence of irregularities in both oxytocin and sex steroid systems. In this double-blind cross-over study, saliva samples were collected from 16 autistic and 29 neurotypical women before and after intranasal administration of 24 IU oxytocin or placebo. Oestradiol, testosterone, and oxytocin levels were quantified in saliva samples. Participants also completed the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) and Empathy Quotient (EQ) questionnaires. Distinct patterns of change in testosterone and oestradiol levels pre- to-post-administration were observed in autistic relative to neurotypical women (ANCOVA, p < 0.05 main effect of Group), controlling for sample collection time. The mean percent change oestradiol was + 8.8% for the autism group and - 13.0% for the neurotypical group (t = 1.81, p = 0.08), while the mean percent change testosterone was + 1.1% in the autism group and - 12.6% in the neurotypical group (t = 1.26, p = 0.22). In the oxytocin condition, the mean percent change oestradiol was + 12.6% in the autism group and - 6.9% in the neurotypical group (t = 1.78, p = 0.08), while the mean percent change testosterone was + 14.4% in the autism group and - 15.2% in the neurotypical group (t = 3.00, p = 0.006). Robust regression confirmed that group differences in percent change hormone levels were not driven by a small number of influential individuals. Baseline hormone levels did not differ between groups when considered individually. However, baseline testosterone relative to oestradiol (T:E2 ratio) was higher in autistic women (p = 0.023, Cohen's d = 0.63), and this ratio correlated positively and negatively with AQ and EQ scores, respectively, in the combined sample. Further studies with larger and more diverse autistic sample are warranted to confirm these effects. This study provides the first evidence that oxytocin influences endogenous testosterone levels in autistic individuals, with autistic women showing increases similar to previous reports of neurotypical men. These findings highlight the need to consider sex steroid hormones as a variable in future oxytocin trials.","Procyshyn Tanya L, Lombardo Michael V, Lai Meng-Chuan, Auyeung Bonnie, Crockford Sarah K, Deakin J, Soubramanian S, Sule A, Baron-Cohen Simon, Bethlehem Richard A I",Molecular autism,"Administration, Intranasal, Adolescent, Adult, Autistic Disorder, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Estradiol, Female, Humans, Middle Aged, Oxytocin, Saliva, Testosterone, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32188502,"Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, 18b Trumpington Road, Cambridge, CB2 8AH, UK.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.; South West London and St. George's Mental Health NHS Trust, London, UK.; Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, 18b Trumpington Road, Cambridge, CB2 8AH, UK. tlp30@cam.ac.uk.; Behavioural and Clinical Neuroscience Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK."

To date, however, the impact of multiple-dose IN-OT treatment on human neural circuitry is largely unknown, and also the possibility that long-term IN-OT use may induce long-lasting neural adaptations remains unexplored. Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, between-subject design (including 38 adult men with ASD), this treatment-mechanism study showed that 4 weeks of daily oxytocin administration (24 IU/day) significantly altered intrinsic (resting-state fMRI) functional connectivity of the amygdala to core regions of the ""social brain"" (particularly orbitofrontal cortex and superior temporal sulcus) up to 4 weeks and 1 year post treatment. The neural adaptations in functional coupling of the amygdala to the orbitofrontal cortex were associated with reduced feelings of avoidance toward others and-at the trend level-reduced repetitive behaviors. These observations contribute to a deeper mechanistic understanding of the neural substrates that underlie behavioral effects of multiple-dose IN-OT treatment, and provide initial insights into the long-lasting neural consequences of chronic IN-OT use on amygdala circuitry.

Oxytocin (OXT), as a neuropeptide, plays a role in emotional and social behaviors. <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i> (<i>L. reuteri</i>) supplementation led to an OXT-dependent behavioral improvement in ASD mouse models. Despite some promising results from animal studies, little is known about the efficacy of supplementation with <i>L. reuteri</i>, alone or with exogenous OXT therapy, on social-behavioral functions in ASD patients. This paper presents a protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a full trial comparing oral supplementation of <i>L. reuteri</i> probiotics and intranasal OXT spray to placebo on the effect of social and behavioral functions in ASD patients. The study will also capture preliminary estimates of the efficacy of the proposed interventions in ASD patients. This pilot trial is a two-staged, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Throughout the study (0-24 weeks), 60 patients with ASD will be randomly assigned to receive either oral <i>L. reuteri</i> probiotics or placebo. In the second study stage (13-24 weeks), all participants will receive intranasal OXT spray. As primary outcomes, serum OXT levels will be assayed and social behaviors will be assessed via the Autism Behavior Checklist and the Social Responsiveness Scale which are validated questionnaires, an objective emotional facial matching test, and a new video-based eye-tracking test. Secondary outcomes include the GI-severity-index and Bristol Stool Chart to assess GI function and gut microbiome/short-chain fatty acids. All the outcomes will be assessed at baseline and weeks 12 and 24. This pilot study will provide important information on the feasibility of recruitment, blinding and concealment, treatment administration, tolerability and adherence, specimen collection, outcome assessment, potential adverse effects, and the preliminary efficacy on both primary and secondary outcomes. If successful, this pilot study will inform a larger randomized controlled trial fully powered to examine the efficacies of oral <i>L. reuteri</i> probiotics and/or intranasal OXT spray on social-behavioral improvement in ASD patients.

However, long-term follow-up studies, evaluating the possibility of long-lasting retention effects, are currently lacking. Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design, this pilot clinical trial explored the possibility of long-lasting behavioral effects of 4 weeks of intranasal oxytocin treatment (24 International Units once daily in the morning) in 40 adult men with ASD. To do so, self-report and informant-based questionnaires assessing core autism symptoms and characterizations of attachment were administered at baseline, immediately after 4 weeks of treatment (approximately 24 h after the last nasal spray administration), and at two follow-up sessions, 4 weeks and 1 year post-treatment. No treatment-specific effects were identified in the primary outcome assessing social symptoms (Social Responsiveness Scale, self- and informant-rated). In particular, with respect to self-reported social responsiveness, improvements were evident both in the oxytocin and in the placebo group, yielding no significant between-group difference (<i>p</i> = .37). Also informant-rated improvements in social responsiveness were not significantly larger in the oxytocin, compared to the placebo group (between-group difference: <i>p</i> = .19). Among the secondary outcome measures, treatment-specific improvements were identified in the Repetitive Behavior Scale and State Adult Attachment Measure, indicating reductions in self-reported repetitive behaviors (<i>p</i> = .04) and reduced feelings of avoidance toward others (<i>p</i> = .03) in the oxytocin group compared to the placebo group, up to 1 month and even 1 year post-treatment. Treatment-specific effects were also revealed in screenings of mood states (Profile of Mood States), indicating higher reports of ""vigor"" (feeling energetic, active, lively) in the oxytocin, compared to the placebo group (<i>p</i> = .03). While no treatment-specific improvements were evident in terms of core social symptoms, the current observations of long-term beneficial effects on repetitive behaviors and feelings of avoidance are promising and suggestive of a therapeutic potential of oxytocin treatment for ASD.

In the current double-blind placebo (PLC) controlled between-subject design study we therefore recruited 71 male subjects (OXT = 34, PLC = 37) to investigate the effects of intranasal OXT (24IU) on both bottom-up attention allocation and top-down attention inhibition using a prosaccade and antisaccade paradigm incorporating social (neutral, happy, fearful, sad, angry faces) and non-social (oval shape) visual stimuli with concurrent eye movement acquisition. Results revealed a marginal significant interaction effect between treatment, condition and task (p = 0.054), with Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests indicating that OXT specifically increased antisaccade errors for social stimuli (ps < 0.04, effect sizes 0.46-0.88), but not non-social stimuli. Antisaccades are under volitional control and therefore this may indicate that OXT treatment reduced top-down inhibition. However, the overall findings are consistent with OXT acting to reduce top-down control of attention as a result of increasing bottom-up early attentional processing of social, but not non-social, stimuli in situations where the two systems are in potential conflict. Marked deficits in bottom-up attention allocation to social stimuli have been reported in autism spectrum disorder, within this context OXT may have the potential to increase early attention allocation towards social cues.","Xu Xiaolei, Li Jialin, Chen Zhuo, Kendrick Keith M, Becker Benjamin",Psychoneuroendocrinology,"Administration, Intranasal, Adolescent, Adult, Attention, Double-Blind Method, Emotions, Eye Movements, Facial Expression, Healthy Volunteers, Humans, Male, Oxytocin, Reaction Time, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31229634,"The Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, MOE Key Laboratory for NeuroInformation, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, 610054, China.

31096266,10.1093/Brain/Awz126,Quantitative facial expression analysis revealed the efficacy and time course of oxytocin in autism.,2019-07-01,"Discrepancies in efficacy between single-dose and repeated administration of oxytocin for autism spectrum disorder have led researchers to hypothesize that time-course changes in efficacy are induced by repeated administrations of the peptide hormone. However, repeatable, objective, and quantitative measurement of autism spectrum disorder's core symptoms are lacking, making it difficult to examine potential time-course changes in efficacy. We tested this hypothesis using repeatable, objective, and quantitative measurement of the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. We examined videos recorded during semi-structured social interaction administered as the primary outcome in single-site exploratory (n = 18, crossover within-subjects design) and multisite confirmatory (n = 106, parallel-group design), double-blind, placebo-controlled 6-week trials of repeated intranasal administrations of oxytocin (48 IU/day) in adult males with autism spectrum disorder. The main outcomes were statistical representative values of objectively quantified facial expression intensity in a repeatable part of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule: the maximum probability (i.e. mode) and the natural logarithm of mode on the probability density function of neutral facial expression and the natural logarithm of mode on the probability density function of happy expression. Our recent study revealed that increases in these indices characterize autistic facial expression, compared with neurotypical individuals. The current results revealed that oxytocin consistently and significantly decreased the increased natural logarithm of mode on the probability density function of neutral facial expression compared with placebo in exploratory (effect-size, -0.57; 95% CI, -1.27 to 0.13; P = 0.023) and confirmatory trials (-0.41; -0.62 to -0.20; P < 0.001). A significant interaction between time-course (at baseline, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks) and the efficacy of oxytocin on the natural logarithm of mode on the probability density function of neutral facial expression was found in confirmatory trial (P < 0.001). Post hoc analyses revealed maximum efficacy at 2 weeks (P < 0.001, Cohen's d = -0.78; 95% CI, -1.21 to -0.35) and deterioration of efficacy at 4 weeks (P = 0.042, Cohen's d = -0.46; 95% CI, -0.90 to -0.01) and 6 weeks (P = 0.10, Cohen's d = -0.35; 95% CI, -0.77 to 0.08), while efficacy was preserved at 2 weeks post-treatment (i.e. 8 weeks) (P < 0.001, Cohen's d = -1.24; 95% CI, -1.71 to -0.78). Quantitative facial expression analyses successfully verified the positive effects of repeated oxytocin on autistic individuals' facial expressions and demonstrated a time-course change in efficacy.

Here, we aimed to replicate this finding and investigate the effects of oxytocin on empathic accuracy in women. To date, women have been seriously underrepresented in human oxytocin research, and it is not known whether the effects observed in male-only samples apply to women. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, we administered 24 IU intranasal oxytocin (and, on a separate occasion, a matching placebo) to 31 men and 40 women and then measured empathic accuracy. AQ was assessed at baseline (prior to drug administration). Replicating a 2010 study by Bartz et al., oxytocin selectively improved empathic accuracy for men who scored higher on the AQ, whereas oxytocin did not benefit their lower AQ counterparts. Conversely, we found no effect of oxytocin on empathic accuracy for women (regardless of their AQ score). In addition to speaking to reliability, this research is important given interest in using oxytocin to augment social functioning in some psychiatric disorders marked by social cognitive impairments. More generally, this research adds to our understanding of the biological systems that support human sociality and provides further evidence for the role of oxytocin therein.","Bartz Jennifer A, Nitschke Jonas P, Krol Sonia A, Tellier Pierre-Paul",Biological psychiatry.

Although the exact neural mechanisms are unclear, oxytocin has been shown to enhance motivation and attention to social stimuli, suggesting a potential to augment social reinforcement learning as the central mechanism of behavioral interventions in ASD. We tested how reinforcement learning in social contexts and associated reward prediction error (RPE) signals in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) were modulated by intranasal oxytocin. Male adults with a childhood diagnosis of ASD (n = 15) and healthy controls (n = 24; aged 18-26 years) performed a probabilistic reinforcement learning task during functional magnetic resonance imaging in a single-center (research center in Germany), randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial. The interventions were intranasal oxytocin (Syntocinon<sup>®</sup>, Novartis; 10 puffs = 20 international units (IUs) per treatment) and placebo spray. Using computational modeling of behavioral data, trial-by-trial RPE signals were assessed and related to brain activation in NAcc during reinforcing feedback in social and non-social contexts. The order of oxytocin/placebo was randomized for 60 participants. Twenty-one participants were excluded from analyses, leaving 39 for the final analysis. Behaviorally, individuals with ASD showed enhanced learning under oxytocin when the learning target as well as feedback was social as compared to non-social (social vs. non-social target: 87.09% vs. 71.29%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 7.28-24.33, p = .003; social vs. non-social feedback: 81.00% vs. 71.29%, 95% CI: 2.81-16.61, p = .027). Correspondingly, oxytocin enhanced the correlation of the RPE signal with NAcc activation during social (vs. non-social) feedback in ASD (3.48 vs. -1.12, respectively, 95% CI: 2.98-6.22, p = .000), whereas in controls, this effect was found in the placebo condition (2.90 vs. -1.14, respectively, 95% CI: 1.07-7.01, p = .010). In ASD, a similar pattern emerged when the learning target was social (3.00 vs. -0.64, respectively, 95% CI: -0.13 to 7.41, p = .057), whereas controls showed a reduced correlation for social learning targets under oxytocin (-0.70 vs. 2.72, respectively, 95% CI: -5.86 to 0.98, p = .008).

The present study combined the randomized placebo-controlled administration of oxytocin versus placebo in healthy men (n = 144) with fMRI-based resting-state functional connectivity to determine the modulatory role of oxytocin on the major basal ganglia pathways. Oxytocin specifically increased connectivity between ventral striatal and pallidal nodes with upstream frontal regions, whereas it decreased the strengths of downstream pathways between the dorsal striatum and posterior cerebellum. These pathways have previously been implicated in salience, reward and behavioral flexibility, thus shaping goal-directed behavior.

As the results, repeated administration of oxytocin significantly decreased the medial prefrontal N-acetylaspartate (NAA; p = 0.043) and glutamate-glutamine levels (Glx; p = 0.001), unlike the acute oxytocin. The decreases were inversely and specifically associated (r = 0.680, p = 0.004 for NAA; r = 0.491, p = 0.053 for Glx) with oxytocin-induced improvements of medial prefrontal functional MRI activity during a social judgment task not with changes during placebo administrations. In wild-type mice, we found that repeated oxytocin administration reduced medial frontal transcript expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor type 2B (p = 0.018), unlike the acute oxytocin, which instead changed the transcript expression associated with oxytocin (p = 0.0004) and neural activity (p = 0.0002). The present findings suggest that the unique sensitivity of the glutamatergic system to repeated oxytocin administration may explain the differential behavioral effects of oxytocin between acute and repeated administration.","Benner Seico, Aoki Yuta, Watanabe Takamitsu, Endo Nozomi, Abe Osamu, Kuroda Miho, Kuwabara Hitoshi, Kawakubo Yuki, Takao Hidemasa, Kunimatsu Akira, Kasai Kiyoto, Bito Haruhiko, Kakeyama Masaki, Yamasue Hidenori",Molecular psychiatry,"Administration, Intranasal, Animals, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Double-Blind Method, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Mice, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Oxytocin",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30262887,"Department of Neurochemistry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.; Department of Radiology, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.; Department of Psychiatry, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashi-ku, Hamamatsu, 431-3192, Japan. yamasue@hama-med.ac.jp.; Department of Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.; Department of Child Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.; Laboratory for Environmental Brain Science, Faculty of Human Sciences, Waseda University, 2-579-15 Mikajima, Tokorozawa, 359-1192, Japan.; Department of Psychiatry, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashi-ku, Hamamatsu, 431-3192, Japan."

In this randomized, parallel-group, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in Japan, 106 ASD individuals (18-48 y.o.) were enrolled between Jan 2015 and March 2016. Participants were randomly assigned to a 6-week intranasal oxytocin (48IU/day, n = 53) or placebo (n = 53) group. One-hundred-three participants were analyzed. Since oxytocin reduced the primary endpoint, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) reciprocity, (from 8.5 to 7.7; P < .001) but placebo also reduced the score (8.3 to 7.2; P < .001), no between-group difference was found (effect size -0.08; 95% CI, -0.46 to 0.31; P = .69); however, plasma oxytocin was only elevated from baseline to endpoint in the oxytocin-group compared with the placebo-group (effect size -1.12; -1.53 to -0.70; P < .0001). Among the secondary endpoints, oxytocin reduced ADOS repetitive behavior (2.0 to 1.5; P < .0001) compared with placebo (2.0 to 1.8; P = .43) (effect size 0.44; 0.05 to 0.83; P = .026). In addition, the duration of gaze fixation on socially relevant regions, another secondary endpoint, was increased by oxytocin (41.2 to 52.3; P = .03) compared with placebo (45.7 to 40.4; P = .25) (effect size 0.55; 0.10 to 1.0; P = .018). No significant effects were observed for the other secondary endpoints. No significant difference in the prevalence of adverse events was observed between groups, although one participant experienced temporary gynecomastia during oxytocin administration. Based on the present findings, we cannot recommend continuous intranasal oxytocin treatment alone at the current dose and duration for treatment of the core social symptoms of high-functioning ASD in adult men, although this large-scale trial suggests oxytocin's possibility to treat ASD repetitive behavior.","Yamasue Hidenori, Okada Takashi, Munesue Toshio, Kuroda Miho, Fujioka Toru, Uno Yota, Matsumoto Kaori, Kuwabara Hitoshi, Mori Daisuke, Okamoto Yuko, Yoshimura Yuko, Kawakubo Yuki, Arioka Yuko, Kojima Masaki, Yuhi Teruko, Owada Keiho, Yassin Walid, Kushima Itaru, Benner Seico, Ogawa Nanayo, Eriguchi Yosuke, Kawano Naoko, Uemura Yukari, Yamamoto Maeri, Kano Yukiko, Kasai Kiyoto, Higashida Haruhiro, Ozaki Norio, Kosaka Hirotaka",Molecular psychiatry,"Administration, Intranasal, Adolescent, Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Double-Blind Method, Gynecomastia, Humans, Japan, Male, Middle Aged, Oxytocin, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29955161,"Department of Psychiatry, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashiku, Hamamatsu City, 431-3192, Japan. yamasue@hama-med.ac.jp.; Research Center for Child Mental Development, University of Fukui, Eiheiji, Fukui, 910-1193, Japan.; Biostatistics Division, Clinical Research Support Center, University of Tokyo Hospital, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.; Department of Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.; Graduate School of Psychology, Kanazawa Institute of Technology, 7-1 Ohgigaoka, Nonoichi, 921-8054, Japan.; Department of Child Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.; Research Center for Child Mental Development, Kanazawa University, 13-1 Takara-machi, Kanazawa, 920-8640, Japan.; Department of Psychiatry, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, 65 Tsurumai-cho, Showa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, 466-8550, Japan."
28712371,10.1017/S0954579417001018,Visual systemizing preference in children with autism: A randomized controlled trial of intranasal oxytocin.,2018-05-01,"Several studies have suggested that the neuropeptide oxytocin may enhance aspects of social communication in autism. Little is known, however, about its effects on nonsocial manifestations, such as restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. In the empathizing-systemizing theory of autism, social deficits are described along the continuum of empathizing ability, whereas nonsocial aspects are characterized in terms of an increased preference for patterned or rule-based systems, called systemizing. We therefore developed an automated eye-tracking task to test whether children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared to matched controls display a visual preference for more highly organized and structured (systemized) real-life images. Then, as part of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, we examined the effect of intranasal oxytocin on systemizing preferences in 16 male children with ASD, compared with 16 matched controls. Participants viewed 14 slides, each containing four related pictures (e.g., of people, animals, scenes, or objects) that differed primarily on the degree of systemizing. Visual systemizing preference was defined in terms of the fixation time and count for each image. Unlike control subjects who showed no gaze preference, individuals with ASD preferred to fixate on more highly systemized pictures. Intranasal oxytocin eliminated this preference in ASD participants, who now showed a similar response to control subjects on placebo. In contrast, control participants increased their visual preference for more systemized images after receiving oxytocin versus placebo. These results suggest that, in addition to its effects on social communication, oxytocin may play a role in some of the nonsocial manifestations of autism.","Strathearn Lane, Kim Sohye, Bastian D Anthony, Jung Jennifer, Iyengar Udita, Martinez Sheila, Goin-Kochel Robin P, Fonagy Peter",Development and psychopathology,"Administration, Intranasal, Adolescent, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Choice Behavior, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Fixation, Ocular, Humans, Male, Oxytocin, Pattern Recognition, Visual",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28712371,Baylor College of Medicine.; University of Iowa.

Prognosis is poor, in part, because existing medications target only associated ASD features. Emerging evidence suggests that the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) may be a blood-based biomarker of social functioning and a possible treatment for ASD. However, prior OXT treatment trials have produced equivocal results, perhaps because of variability in patients' underlying neuropeptide biology, but this hypothesis has not been tested. Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design, we tested the efficacy and tolerability of 4-wk intranasal OXT treatment (24 International Units, twice daily) in 32 children with ASD, aged 6-12 y. When pretreatment neuropeptide measures were included in the statistical model, OXT compared with placebo treatment significantly enhanced social abilities in children with ASD [as measured by the trial's primary outcome measure, the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS)]. Importantly, pretreatment blood OXT concentrations also predicted treatment response, such that individuals with the lowest pretreatment OXT concentrations showed the greatest social improvement. OXT was well tolerated, and its effects were specific to social functioning, with no observed decrease in repetitive behaviors or anxiety. Finally, as with many trials, some placebo-treated participants showed improvement on the SRS. This enhanced social functioning was mirrored by a posttreatment increase in their blood OXT concentrations, suggesting that increased endogenous OXT secretion may underlie this improvement. These findings indicate that OXT treatment enhances social abilities in children with ASD and that individuals with pretreatment OXT signaling deficits may stand to benefit the most from OXT treatment.","Parker Karen J, Oztan Ozge, Libove Robin A, Sumiyoshi Raena D, Jackson Lisa P, Karhson Debra S, Summers Jacqueline E, Hinman Kyle E, Motonaga Kara S, Phillips Jennifer M, Carson Dean S, Garner Joseph P, Hardan Antonio Y",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"Administration, Inhalation, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Female, Humans, Male, Oxytocics, Oxytocin, Social Skills",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28696286,"Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305; kjparker@stanford.edu.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305."

In a randomized sequence of single-dose sessions, 17 male adults with ASD received 8 international units (IU) oxytocin, 24IU oxytocin or placebo followed by four social-cognitive tasks. We observed an omnibus main effect of treatment on the primary outcome measure of overt emotion salience as measured by emotional ratings of faces (η<sup>2</sup>=0.18). Compared to placebo, 8IU treatment increased overt emotion salience (P=0.02, d=0.63). There was no statistically significant increase after 24IU treatment (P=0.12, d=0.4). The effects after 8IU oxytocin were observed despite no significant increase in peripheral blood plasma oxytocin concentrations. We found no significant effects for reading the mind in the eyes task performance or secondary outcome social-cognitive tasks (emotional dot probe and face-morphing).

The neuropeptide oxytocin triggers anxiolytic functions and enhances eye gaze, facial emotion recognition and neural correlates of face processing in ASD. Here we investigated whether a single dose of oxytocin increases attention to faces in ASD. As a secondary question, we explored the influence of social anxiety on these effects. We tested for oxytocin's effects on attention to neutral faces as compared to houses in a sample of 29 autistic individuals and 30 control participants using a dot-probe paradigm with two different presentation times (100 or 500 ms). A single dose of 24 IU oxytocin was administered in a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Under placebo, ASD individuals paid less attention to faces presented for 500 ms than did controls. Oxytocin administration increased the allocation of attention toward faces in ASD to a level observed in controls. Secondary analyses revealed that these oxytocin effects primarily occurred in ASD individuals with high levels of social anxiety who were characterized by attentional avoidance of faces under placebo. Our results confirm a positive influence of intranasal oxytocin on social attention processes in ASD. Further, they suggest that oxytocin may in particular restore the attentional preference for facial information in ASD individuals with high social anxiety. We conclude that oxytocin's anxiolytic properties may partially account for its positive effects on socio-cognitive functioning in ASD, such as enhanced eye gaze and facial emotion recognition.","Kanat M, Spenthof I, Riedel A, van Elst L T, Heinrichs M, Domes G",Translational psychiatry,"Adult, Attention, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Choice Behavior, Double-Blind Method, Facial Expression, Facial Recognition, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Oxytocin, Phobia, Social, Reaction Time",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28418399,"Department of Psychiatry, Section for Experimental Neuropsychiatry, University Medical School Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.; Department of Psychology, Laboratory for Biological and Personality Psychology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.; Freiburg Brain Imaging Center, University Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany."

Previous oxytocin studies are male biased and often constrained by task-based inferences. Here, we investigate the impact of oxytocin on resting-state connectivity between subcortical and cortical networks in women. We collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data on 26 typically developing women 40 min following intranasal oxytocin administration using a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design. Independent components analysis (ICA) was applied to examine connectivity between networks. An independent analysis of oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene expression in human subcortical and cortical areas was carried out to determine plausibility of direct oxytocin effects on OXTR. In women, OXTR was highly expressed in striatal and other subcortical regions, but showed modest expression in cortical areas. Oxytocin increased connectivity between corticostriatal circuitry typically involved in reward, emotion, social communication, language and pain processing. This effect was 1.39 standard deviations above the null effect of no difference between oxytocin and placebo. This oxytocin-related effect on corticostriatal connectivity covaried with autistic traits, such that oxytocin-related increase in connectivity was stronger in individuals with higher autistic traits. In sum, oxytocin strengthened corticostriatal connectivity in women, particularly with cortical networks that are involved in social-communicative, motivational and affective processes. This effect may be important for future work on neurological and psychiatric conditions (for example, autism), particularly through highlighting how oxytocin may operate differently for subsets of individuals.","Bethlehem R A I, Lombardo M V, Lai M-C, Auyeung B, Crockford S K, Deakin J, Soubramanian S, Sule A, Kundu P, Voon V, Baron-Cohen S",Translational psychiatry,"Administration, Intranasal, Adult, Affect, Cerebral Cortex, Communication, Connectome, Corpus Striatum, Double-Blind Method, Female, Gene Expression, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Middle Aged, Motivation, Nerve Net, Receptors, Oxytocin, Social Behavior, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28418398,"Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.; Department of Psychiatry, Autism Research Centre, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.; Brain Imaging Center, Icahn Institute of Medicine at Mt.

The social deficits that characterize ASD may relate to reduced connectivity between brain sites on the mesolimbic reward pathway (nucleus accumbens; amygdala) that receive OT projections and contribute to social motivation, and cortical sites involved in social perception. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, we show that OT administration in ASD increases activity in brain regions important for perceiving social-emotional information. Further, OT enhances connectivity between nodes of the brain's reward and socioemotional processing systems, and does so preferentially for social (versus nonsocial) stimuli. This effect is observed both while viewing coherent versus scrambled biological motion, and while listening to happy versus angry voices.

We conducted a single-center phase 2, pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, clinical trial in young adults with high-functioning ASD, to determine whether oxytocin dosage and genetic background of the oxytocin receptor affects oxytocin efficacy. This trial consisted of double-blind (12 weeks), open-label (12 weeks) and follow-up phases (8 weeks). To examine dose dependency, 60 participants were randomly assigned to high-dose (32 IU per day) or low-dose intranasal oxytocin (16 IU per day), or placebo groups during the double-blind phase. Next, we measured single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR). In the intention-to-treat population, no outcomes were improved after oxytocin administration. However, in male participants, Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scores in the high-dose group, but not the low-dose group, were significantly higher than in the placebo group. Furthermore, we examined whether oxytocin efficacy, reflected in the CGI-I scores, is influenced by estimated daily dosage and OXTR polymorphisms in male participants. We found that >21 IU per day oxytocin was more effective than ⩽21 IU per day, and that a SNP in OXTR (rs6791619) predicted CGI-I scores for ⩽21 IU per day oxytocin treatment.

Individual differences in stress-related avoidance tendencies should be taken into account when considering OXT as a treatment of social deficiencies in autism.","Althaus M, Groen Y, Wijers A A, Noltes H, Tucha O, Hoekstra P J",Neuropsychologia,"Adolescent, Adult, Analysis of Variance, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Brain Mapping, Double-Blind Method, Electrocardiography, Electroencephalography, Evoked Potentials, Humans, Intelligence Tests, Interpersonal Relations, Male, Orientation, Oxytocin, Personality, Photic Stimulation, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Social Behavior, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26498227,"Autism Team of the North of the Netherlands (ATN), Laan Corpus den Hoorn 102-2, 9728 JR Groningen, The Netherlands.; Department of Child- and Adolescent Psychiatry, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Hanzeplein1, 9713 GZ Groningen, The Netherlands.; Department of Clinical and Developmental Neuropsychology, University of Groningen, Grote Kruisstraat 2/1, 9712 TS Groningen, The Netherlands.; Department of Child- and Adolescent Psychiatry, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Hanzeplein1, 9713 GZ Groningen, The Netherlands.

Given the crucial role of the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) in social bonding, this study tests whether OXT-based mechanisms also determine the bond between consumers and brands. We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled study involving 101 subjects and analyzed the effect of intranasal OXT on consumers' attribution of relationship qualities to brands, brands paired with human celebrity endorsers, and familiar persons. OXT indeed promoted the attribution of relationship qualities not only in the case of social and semi-social stimuli, but also brands. Intriguingly, for subjects scoring high on autistic-like traits, the effect of OXT was completely reversed, evident in even lower relationship qualities across all stimulus categories. The importance of OXT in a CBR context is further corroborated by a three-fold increase in endogenous release of OXT following exposure to one's favorite brand and positive associations between baseline peripheral OXT concentrations and brand relationship qualities. Collectively, our findings indicate that OXT not only plays a fundamental role in developing interpersonal relationships, but also enables relationship formation with objects such as brands.","Fürst Andreas, Thron Jesko, Scheele Dirk, Marsh Nina, Hurlemann René",Scientific reports,"Administration, Intranasal, Adult, Analysis of Variance, Autistic Disorder, Codependency, Psychological, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Interpersonal Relations, Male, Neuropeptides, Oxytocin, Psychomotor Performance, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26449882,"Department of Marketing, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), 90403 Nürnberg, Germany and Professorial Fellow of the Business School at the University of Eastern Finland (UEF), 70211 Kuopio, Finland.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Bonn, 53105 Bonn, Germany."
26336909,10.1093/Brain/Awv249,Clinical and neural effects of six-week administration of oxytocin on core symptoms of autism.,2015-11-01,"Autism spectrum disorder is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder with no established pharmacological treatment for its core symptoms. Although previous literature has shown that single-dose administration of oxytocin temporally mitigates autistic social behaviours in experimental settings, it remains in dispute whether such potentially beneficial responses in laboratories can result in clinically positive effects in daily life situations, which are measurable only in long-term observations of individuals with the developmental disorder undergoing continual oxytocin administration. Here, to address this issue, we performed an exploratory, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial including 20 high-functional adult males with autism spectrum disorder. Data obtained from 18 participants who completed the trial showed that 6-week intranasal administration of oxytocin significantly reduced autism core symptoms specific to social reciprocity, which was clinically evaluated by Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (P = 0.034, PFDR < 0.05, Cohen's d = 0.78). Critically, the improvement of this clinical score was accompanied by oxytocin-induced enhancement of task-independent resting-state functional connectivity between anterior cingulate cortex and dorso-medial prefrontal cortex (rho = -0.60, P = 0.011), which was measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Moreover, using the same social-judgement task as used in our previous single-dose oxytocin trial, we confirmed that the current continual administration also significantly mitigated behavioural and neural responses during the task, both of which were originally impaired in autistic individuals (judgement tendency: P = 0.019, d = 0.62; eye-gaze effect: P = 0.03, d = 0.56; anterior cingulate activity: P = 0.00069, d = 0.97; dorso-medial prefrontal activity: P = 0.0014, d = 0.92; all, PFDR < 0.05). Furthermore, despite its longer administration, these effect sizes of the 6-week intervention were not larger than those seen in our previous single-dose intervention. These findings not only provide the evidence for clinically beneficial effects of continual oxytocin administration on the core social symptoms of autism spectrum disorder with suggesting its underlying biological mechanisms, but also highlight the necessity to seek optimal regimens of continual oxytocin treatment in future studies.","Watanabe Takamitsu, Kuroda Miho, Kuwabara Hitoshi, Aoki Yuta, Iwashiro Norichika, Tatsunobu Natsubori, Takao Hidemasa, Nippashi Yasumasa, Kawakubo Yuki, Kunimatsu Akira, Kasai Kiyoto, Yamasue Hidenori",Brain : a journal of neurology,"Administration, Intranasal, Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Brain, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Functional Neuroimaging, Gyrus Cinguli, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Neural Pathways, Oxytocics, Oxytocin, Prefrontal Cortex, Social Behavior, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26336909,"1 Department of Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan 2 Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan 3 Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, 17 Queen Square, London, WC1N 3AR, UK.; 5 Department of Radiology, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.; 1 Department of Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan 6 Japan Science and Technology Agency, CREST, 5 Sambancho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 102-0075, Japan yamasue-tky@umin.ac.jp.; 1 Department of Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.; 4 Department of Child Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan."

Oxytocin has been widely reported to affect social-communicative function and its neural underpinnings. Here we report the first evidence that intranasal oxytocin administration improves a core problem that individuals with autism have in using eye contact appropriately in real-world social settings. A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design is used to examine how intranasal administration of 24 IU of oxytocin affects gaze behavior for 32 adult males with autism and 34 controls in a real-time interaction with a researcher. This interactive paradigm bypasses many of the limitations encountered with conventional static or computer-based stimuli. Eye movements are recorded using eye tracking, providing an objective measurement of looking patterns. The measure is shown to be sensitive to the reduced eye contact commonly reported in autism, with the autism group spending less time looking to the eye region of the face than controls. Oxytocin administration selectively enhanced gaze to the eyes in both the autism and control groups (transformed mean eye-fixation difference per second=0.082; 95% CI:0.025-0.14, P=0.006). Within the autism group, oxytocin has the most effect on fixation duration in individuals with impaired levels of eye contact at baseline (Cohen's d=0.86). These findings demonstrate that the potential benefits of oxytocin in autism extend to a real-time interaction, providing evidence of a therapeutic effect in a key aspect of social communication.","Auyeung B, Lombardo M V, Heinrichs M, Chakrabarti B, Sule A, Deakin J B, Bethlehem R A I, Dickens L, Mooney N, Sipple J A N, Thiemann P, Baron-Cohen S",Translational psychiatry,"Administration, Intranasal, Adolescent, Adult, Asperger Syndrome, Autistic Disorder, Case-Control Studies, Double-Blind Method, Eye Movement Measurements, Fixation, Ocular, Humans, Interpersonal Relations, Male, Middle Aged, Oxytocics, Oxytocin, Social Behavior, Social Skills, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25668435,"Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.; 1] Department of Psychology, Laboratory for Biological and Personality Psychology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany [2] Freiburg Brain Imaging Center, University Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.; 1] Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK [2] School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences, University of Reading, Whiteknights, Reading, UK.; 1] Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK [2] Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT), Cambridge, UK.; 1] Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK [2] Department of Psychology, University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus [3] Center for Applied Neuroscience, University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus.; 1] Department of Psychology, The School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK [2] Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.; 1] Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK [2] Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT), Cambridge, UK.; South Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, Bedford, UK."

However, most participants have been male, while previous research in our lab demonstrated sexually differentiated effects of OT and AVP on the neural response to reciprocated cooperation. Here we extend our previous work by significantly increasing the number of participants to enable the use of more stringent statistical thresholds that permit more precise localization of OT and AVP effects in the brain. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 153 men and 151 women were randomized to receive 24 IU intranasal OT, 20 IU intranasal AVP or placebo. Afterwards, they were imaged with fMRI while playing an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game with same-sex partners. Sex differences were observed for effects of OT on the neural response to reciprocated cooperation, such that OT increased the caduate/putamen response among males, whereas it decreased this response among females. Thus, 24 IU OT may increase the reward or salience of positive social interactions among men, while decreasing their reward or salience among women. Similar sex differences were also observed for AVP effects within bilateral insula and right supramarginal gyrus when a more liberal statistical threshold was employed. While our findings support previous suggestions that exogenous nonapeptides may be effective treatments for disorders such as depression and autism spectrum disorder, they caution against uniformly extending such treatments to men and women alike.","Feng Chunliang, Hackett Patrick D, DeMarco Ashley C, Chen Xu, Stair Sabrina, Haroon Ebrahim, Ditzen Beate, Pagnoni Giuseppe, Rilling James K",Brain imaging and behavior,"Administration, Intranasal, Adolescent, Brain, Brain Mapping, Cerebrovascular Circulation, Cooperative Behavior, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Oxygen, Oxytocin, Prisoner Dilemma, Psychotropic Drugs, Reward, Sex Characteristics, Vasopressins, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25416642,"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.; Department of Psychology, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA.; Department of Anthropology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.; Department of Neural, Biomedical, and Metabolic Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.; Department of Anthropology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA. jrillin@emory.edu."
25149412,10.1093/Brain/Awu231,Oxytocin improves behavioural and neural deficits in inferring others' social emotions in autism.,2014-11-01,"Recent studies have suggested oxytocin's therapeutic effects on deficits in social communication and interaction in autism spectrum disorder through improvement of emotion recognition with direct emotional cues, such as facial expression and voice prosody. Although difficulty in understanding of others' social emotions and beliefs under conditions without direct emotional cues also plays an important role in autism spectrum disorder, no study has examined the potential effect of oxytocin on this difficulty. Here, we sequentially conducted both a case-control study and a clinical trial to investigate the potential effects of oxytocin on this difficulty at behavioural and neural levels measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging during a psychological task. This task was modified from the Sally-Anne Task, a well-known first-order false belief task. The task was optimized for investigation of the abilities to infer another person's social emotions and beliefs distinctively so as to test the hypothesis that oxytocin improves deficit in inferring others' social emotions rather than beliefs, under conditions without direct emotional cues. In the case-control study, 17 males with autism spectrum disorder showed significant behavioural deficits in inferring others' social emotions (P = 0.018) but not in inferring others' beliefs (P = 0.064) compared with 17 typically developing demographically-matched male participants. They also showed significantly less activity in the right anterior insula and posterior superior temporal sulcus during inferring others' social emotions, and in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex during inferring others' beliefs compared with the typically developing participants (P < 0.001 and cluster size > 10 voxels). Then, to investigate potential effects of oxytocin on these behavioural and neural deficits, we conducted a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover within-subject trial for single-dose intranasal administration of 24 IU oxytocin in an independent group of 20 males with autism spectrum disorder. Behaviourally, oxytocin significantly increased the correct rate in inferring others' social emotions (P = 0.043, one-tail). At the neural level, the peptide significantly enhanced the originally-diminished brain activity in the right anterior insula during inferring others' social emotions (P = 0.004), but not in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex during inferring others' beliefs (P = 0.858). The present findings suggest that oxytocin enhances the ability to understand others' social emotions that have also required second-order false belief rather than first-order false beliefs under conditions without direct emotional cues in autism spectrum disorder at both the behaviour and neural levels.","Aoki Yuta, Yahata Noriaki, Watanabe Takamitsu, Takano Yosuke, Kawakubo Yuki, Kuwabara Hitoshi, Iwashiro Norichika, Natsubori Tatsunobu, Inoue Hideyuki, Suga Motomu, Takao Hidemasa, Sasaki Hiroki, Gonoi Wataru, Kunimatsu Akira, Kasai Kiyoto, Yamasue Hidenori",Brain : a journal of neurology,"Adult, Case-Control Studies, Cerebral Cortex, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Emotions, Empathy, Facial Expression, Functional Neuroimaging, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Oxytocin, Placebos, Social Perception, Theory of Mind, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25149412,"1 Department of Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan 5 Japan Science and Technology Agency, CREST, 5 Sambancho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 102-0075, Japan yamasue-tky@umin.ac.jp.; 1 Department of Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.; 4 Department of Radiology, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.; 3 Department of Child Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.; 2 Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan."

Our recent paper reported that oxytocin mitigated autistic behavioral deficits through the restoration of activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), as demonstrated with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a socio-communication task. However, it is unknown whether oxytocin exhibited effects at the neuronal level, which was outside of the specific task examined. In the same randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject cross-over clinical trial in which a single dose of intranasal oxytocin (24 IU) was administered to 40 men with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (UMIN000002241/000004393), we measured N-acetylaspartate (NAA) levels, a marker for neuronal energy demand, in the vmPFC using (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS). The differences in the NAA levels between the oxytocin and placebo sessions were associated with oxytocin-induced fMRI signal changes in the vmPFC. The oxytocin-induced increases in the fMRI signal could be predicted by the NAA differences between the oxytocin and placebo sessions (P=0.002), an effect that remained after controlling for variability in the time between the fMRI and (1)H-MRS scans (P=0.006) and the order of administration of oxytocin and placebo (P=0.001). Furthermore, path analysis showed that the NAA differences in the vmPFC triggered increases in the task-dependent fMRI signals in the vmPFC, which consequently led to improvements in the socio-communication difficulties associated with autism. The present study suggests that the beneficial effects of oxytocin are not limited to the autistic behavior elicited by our psychological task, but may generalize to other autistic behavioral problems associated with the vmPFC.","Aoki Y, Watanabe T, Abe O, Kuwabara H, Yahata N, Takano Y, Iwashiro N, Natsubori T, Takao H, Kawakubo Y, Kasai K, Yamasue H",Molecular psychiatry,"Administration, Intranasal, Adult, Aspartic Acid, Autistic Disorder, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Image Processing, Computer-Assisted, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Oxygen, Oxytocics, Oxytocin, Prefrontal Cortex, Protons, Recovery of Function, Retrospective Studies, Time Factors, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25070538,"Department of Radiology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Child Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; 1] Department of Radiology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan [2] Department of Radiology, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; 1] Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan [2] Department of Physiology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; 1] Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan [2] Japan Science and Technology Agency, CREST, Tokyo, Japan."

Importantly, the amygdala appears central in the regulation of 5-HT by OXT: [(18)F]MPPF BPND changes in the DRN correlated with changes in right amygdala, which were in turn correlated with changes in hippocampus, insula, subgenual, and orbitofrontal cortex, a circuit implicated in the control of stress, mood, and social behaviors. OXT administration is known to inhibit amygdala activity and results in a decrease of anxiety, whereas high amygdala activity and 5-HT dysregulation have been associated with increased anxiety.

Specifically, the experimental rationale was to manipulate the reward value of interpersonal touch independent of the intensity and type of actual cutaneous stimulation administered. Thus, 40 heterosexual males believed that they were touched by either a man or a woman, although in fact an identical pattern of touch was always given by the same female experimenter blind to condition type. Our results show that OXT increased the perceived pleasantness of female, but not male touch, and associated neural responses in insula, precuneus, orbitofrontal, and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex. Moreover, the behavioral and neural effects of OXT were negatively correlated with autistic-like traits. Taken together, this is the first study to show that the perceived hedonic value of human heterosexual interpersonal touch is facilitated by OXT in men, but that its behavioral and neural effects in this context are blunted in individuals with autistic traits.","Scheele Dirk, Kendrick Keith M, Khouri Christoph, Kretzer Elisa, Schläpfer Thomas E, Stoffel-Wagner Birgit, Güntürkün Onur, Maier Wolfgang, Hurlemann René",Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,"Administration, Intranasal, Adult, Autistic Disorder, Brain, Brain Mapping, Central Nervous System Agents, Double-Blind Method, Emotions, Heterosexuality, Humans, Interpersonal Relations, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Oxytocin, Reward, Touch Perception",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24694924,"1] Department of Psychiatry, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany [2] Division of Medical Psychology, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.; Department of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.; 1] Department of Psychiatry, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany [2] Departments of Psychiatry and Mental Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.; 1] Department of Psychiatry, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany [2] German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Bonn, Germany.; Key Laboratory for Neuroinformation, School of Life Science and Technology, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, PR China.; Department of Biopsychology, Ruhr University, Bochum, Germany."

Despite growing prospects for oxytocin as a therapeutic agent for ASD, no direct neurobiological evidence exists for oxytocin's beneficial effects on this core symptom of ASD. This is slowing clinical application of the neuropeptide. To directly examine whether oxytocin has beneficial effects on the sociocommunicational deficits of ASD using both behavioral and neural measures. At the University of Tokyo Hospital, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject-crossover, single-site experimental trial in which intranasal oxytocin and placebo were administered. A total of 40 highly functioning men with ASD participated and were randomized in the trial. Single-dose intranasal administration of oxytocin (24 IU) and placebo. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined effects of oxytocin on behavioral neural responses of the participants to a social psychological task. In our previous case-control study using the same psychological task, when making decisions about social information with conflicting verbal and nonverbal contents, participants with ASD made judgments based on nonverbal contents less frequently with longer time and could not induce enough activation in the medial prefrontal cortex. Therefore, our main outcomes and measures were the frequency of the nonverbal information-based judgments (NVJs), the response time for NVJs, and brain activity of the medial prefrontal cortex during NVJs. Intranasal oxytocin enabled the participants to make NVJs more frequently (P = .03) with shorter response time (P = .02).

The primary aim of this study was to examine the safety/therapeutic effects of intranasal oxytocin versus placebo in adults with ASD, with respect to the two core symptom domains of social cognition/functioning and repetitive behaviors. This was a pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design trial of intranasal oxytocin versus placebo in 19 adults with ASD (16 males; 33.20 ± 13.29 years). Subjects were randomized to 24 IU intranasal oxytocin or placebo in the morning and afternoon for 6 weeks. Measures of social function/cognition (the Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy) and repetitive behaviors (Repetitive Behavior Scale Revised) were administered. Secondary measures included the Social Responsiveness Scale, Reading-the-Mind-in-the-Eyes Test and the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale - compulsion subscale and quality of life (World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire - emotional/social subscales). Full-information maximum-likelihood parameter estimates were obtained and tested using mixed-effects regression analyses.

In mammals, social participation originates within the parent-infant bond and is supported by the oxytocin (OT) system, whose functioning is transmitted from parent to child through patterns of parental care. Human studies indicate that OT administration increases affiliative behavior, including trust, empathy, and social reciprocity. Here, we examine whether OT administration to parent can enhance physiological and behavioral processes that support parental social engagement but, moreover, can have parallel effects on the infant. Utilizing a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, 35 fathers and their 5-month-old infants were observed twice following administration of OT or placebo to father in the face-to-face still-face paradigm. Parent and infant salivary OT were assessed at multiple time points, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was measured in the three face-to-face still-face episodes, and social behaviors of the parent and child were micro-coded for indices of social engagement. Oxytocin administration increased father salivary OT, RSA during free play, and key parenting behaviors that support parental-infant bonding. Parallel increases were also found in the infant's salivary OT, RSA response, and engagement behavior, including social gaze, exploration, and social reciprocity. Results are the first to demonstrate that OT administration to one attachment partner can have parallel effects on the other and underscore the role of OT in the cross-generation transmission of human social participation.

These effects are probably mediated by genetic variations within the OT system. One potential candidate could be the CD38 gene, which codes for a transmembrane protein engaged in OT secretion processes. A common variation in this gene (rs3796863) was recently found to be associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Using an imaging genetics approach, we studied differential effects of an intranasal OT application on neural processing of social stimuli in 55 healthy young men depending on their CD38 gene variant in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design. Genotype had a significant influence on both behavioral and neuronal measures of social processing. Homozygotic risk allele carriers showed slower reaction times (RT) and higher activation of left fusiform gyrus during visual processing of social stimuli. Under OT activation differences between genotypes were more evident (though not statistically significantly increased) and RT were accelerated in homozygotic risk allele carriers. According to our data, rs3796863 mainly influences fusiform gyrus activation, an area which has been widely discussed in ASD research. OT seems to modulate this effect by enhancing activation differences between allele groups, which suggests an interaction between genetic makeup and OT availability on fusiform gyrus activation. These results support recent approaches to apply OT as a pharmacological treatment of ASD symptoms.","Sauer Carina, Montag Christian, Wörner Christiane, Kirsch Peter, Reuter Martin",Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,"Administration, Intranasal, Adult, Affect, Arousal, Attention, Autistic Disorder, Brain, Brain Mapping, Cross-Over Studies, Follow-Up Studies, Genetic Variation, Genotype, Humans, Image Processing, Computer-Assisted, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Oxygen, Oxytocin, Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1, Reaction Time, Social Perception, Surveys and Questionnaires, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22278094,"Department of Clinical Psychology, Central Institute of Mental Health, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.

Recent behavioral evidence shows that the neuropeptide oxytocin increases trust among humans, thus offering a unique chance of gaining a deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying trust and the adaptation to breach of trust. We examined the neural circuitry of trusting behavior by combining the intranasal, double-blind, administration of oxytocin with fMRI. We find that subjects in the oxytocin group show no change in their trusting behavior after they learned that their trust had been breached several times while subjects receiving placebo decrease their trust. This difference in trust adaptation is associated with a specific reduction in activation in the amygdala, the midbrain regions, and the dorsal striatum in subjects receiving oxytocin, suggesting that neural systems mediating fear processing (amygdala and midbrain regions) and behavioral adaptations to feedback information (dorsal striatum) modulate oxytocin's effect on trust.

The results showed that children on exclusion diets reported significantly lower scores of abdominal pain and bowel movement, as well as lower abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. and Veillonellaceae family, but higher presence of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bacteroides spp. In addition, significant correlations were found between bacterial populations and faecal amino acids in this group, compared to children following an unrestricted diet. Following B-GOS® intervention, we observed improvements in anti-social behaviour, significant increase of Lachnospiraceae family, and significant changes in faecal and urine metabolites. To our knowledge, this is the first study where the effect of exclusion diets and prebiotics has been evaluated in autism, showing potential beneficial effects. A combined dietary approach resulted in significant changes in gut microbiota composition and metabolism suggesting that multiple interventions might be more relevant for the improvement of these aspects as well as psychological traits.

Our study aimed to compare gut microbiota composition between these disorders and evaluate the effect of probiotic supplementation. We conducted a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 80 children aged 5-14 years (39 with ADHD, 41 with ASD). Baseline and post-intervention fecal samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing to identify changes in gut microbiota composition. We identified 22 taxa differentiating ADHD and ASD (AUC = 0.939), characterised by increased presence of Clostridia, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae in ADHD, and Bacteroides, Bacilli and Actinobacteria in ASD. These differences remained after accounting for potential confounders. ASD children receiving probiotics had significant increases in Chao 1, Fisher's alpha, and Shannon indices whereas no significant differences in α and β-diversity were found in ADHD. In ADHD, bacteria with potential adverse effects were under-represented. In ASD, the abundance of Eggerthellaceae, and other taxa associated with gastrointestinal problems and anxiety was decreased. Variations in gut microbiota may influence responses in ADHD and ASD. Probiotic supplementation favorably altered gut microbiota composition, offering insights for future therapeutic strategies targeting the microbiome in neurodevelopmental disorders. Recent research underscores the role of gut microbiota in ADHD and ASD, indicating that diet can significantly influence microbiota composition and potentially manage these neurodevelopmental disorders. This study reveals distinct differences in gut microbiota composition between children with ADHD and ASD and demonstrates that probiotic supplementation can modulate specific microbial genera in each disorder. These findings pave the way for the development of innovative microbiome-targeted therapies, offering a new avenue for the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders. Understanding this relationship is crucial for designing future interventions.","Novau-Ferré Nil, Papandreou Christopher, Rojo-Marticella Meritxell, Canals-Sans Josefa, Bulló Mònica",Research in developmental disabilities,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40184961,"Nutrition and Metabolic Health Research Group (NuMeH).

Participants were randomly assigned to probiotics (De Simone Formulation) (n=42) or placebo (n=43) for six months. Sixty-three (74%) children completed the trial. No differences between groups were detected on the primary outcome measure, the Total Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule - Calibrated Severity Score (ADOS-CSS). An exploratory secondary analysis on subgroups of children with or without Gastrointestinal Symptoms (GI group, n= 30; NGI group, n=55) revealed in the NGI group treated with probiotics a significant decline in ADOS scores as compared to that in the placebo group, with a mean reduction of 0.81 in Total ADOS CSS and of 1.14 in Social-Affect ADOS CSS over six months. In the GI group treated with probiotics we found greater improvements in some GI symptoms, adaptive functioning, and sensory profiles than in the GI group treated with placebo. These results suggest potentially positive effects of probiotics on core autism symptoms in a subset of ASD children independent of the specific intermediation of the probiotic effect on GI symptoms. Further studies are warranted to replicate and extend these promising findings on a wider population with subsets of ASD patients which share targets of intervention on the microbiota-gut-brain axis.

However, few studies were placebo-controlled, and there is no study on persons with an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis. Our aim was to study effects of Synbiotic 2000 on psychiatric symptoms and functioning in children and adults with ADHD without an autism diagnosis. Children and adults (n = 182) with an ADHD diagnosis completed the nine weeks randomized double-blind parallel placebo-controlled trial examining effects of Synbiotic 2000 on the primary endpoints ADHD symptoms, autism symptoms and daily functioning, and the secondary endpoint emotion regulation, measured using the questionnaires SNAP-IV, ASRS, WFIRS, SCQ, AQ and DERS-16. Levels at baseline of plasma C-reactive protein and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), central to leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion facilitating inflammatory responses in tissues, were measured using Meso Scale Discovery. Synbiotic 2000 and placebo improved ADHD symptoms equally well, and neither active treatment nor placebo had any statistically significant effect on functioning or sub-diagnostic autism symptoms. However, Synbiotic 2000, specifically, reduced sub-diagnostic autism symptoms in the domain restricted, repetitive and stereotyped behaviors in children, and improved emotion regulation in the domain of goal-directed behavior in adults. In children with elevated sVCAM-1 levels at baseline as well as in children without ADHD medication, Synbiotic 2000 reduced both the total score of autism symptoms, and the restricted, repetitive and stereotyped behaviors. In adults with elevated sVCAM-1 at baseline, Synbiotic 2000 significantly improved emotion regulation, both the total score and four of the five subdomains. To conclude, while no definite Synbiotic 2000-specific effect was detected, the analysis of those with elevated plasma sVCAM-1 levels proposed a reduction of autism symptoms in children and an improvement of emotion regulation in adults with ADHD.

Manipulation of the gut microbiome with probiotics may be a therapeutic strategy with the potential to relieve gastrointestinal (GI) comorbidities and improve psychiatric symptoms. Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, commensal yeast species, can be imbalanced in the unhealthy human microbiome, and these fungal exposures were previously found elevated in schizophrenia. In a longitudinal, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot investigation of 56 outpatients with schizophrenia, we examined the impact of probiotic treatment on yeast antibody levels, and the relationship between treatment and antibody levels on bowel discomfort and psychiatric symptoms. We found that probiotic treatment significantly reduced C. albicans antibodies over the 14-week study period in males, but not in females. Antibody levels of S. cerevisiae were not altered in either treatment group. The highest levels of bowel discomfort over time occurred in C. albicans-seropositive males receiving the placebo. We observed trends towards improvement in positive psychiatric symptoms in males treated with probiotics who were seronegative for C. albicans. Results from this pilot study hint at an association of C. albicans seropositivity with worse positive psychiatric symptoms, which was confirmed in a larger cohort of 384 males with schizophrenia.

The GI disturbances in ASD might be linked to gut dysbiosis representing the observable phenotype of a ""gut-brain axis"" disruption. The exploitation of strategies which can restore normal gut microbiota and reduce the gut production and absorption of toxins, such as probiotics addition/supplementation in a diet, may represent a non-pharmacological option in the treatment of GI disturbances in ASD. The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to determine the effects of supplementation with a probiotic mixture (Vivomixx®) in ASD children not only on specific GI symptoms, but also on the core deficits of the disorder, on cognitive and language development, and on brain function and connectivity. An ancillary aim is to evaluate possible effects of probiotic supplementation on urinary concentrations of phthalates (chemical pollutants) which have been previously linked to ASD. A group of 100 preschoolers with ASD will be classified as belonging to a GI group or to a Non-GI (NGI) group on the basis of a symptom severity index specific to GI disorders. In order to obtain four arms, subjects belonging to the two groups (GI and NGI) will be blind randomized 1:1 to regular diet with probiotics or with placebo for 6 months. All participants will be assessed at baseline, after three months and after six months from baseline in order to evaluate the possible changes in: (1) GI symptoms; (2) autism symptoms severity; (3) affective and behavioral comorbid symptoms; (4) plasmatic, urinary and fecal biomarkers related to abnormal intestinal function; (5) neurophysiological patterns. The effects of treatments with probiotics on children with ASD need to be evaluated through rigorous controlled trials.

Baseline measurements of autonomic nervous system functioning were obtained, and anxiety was assessed at baseline and following drug administration. Participants solved the anagrams more quickly in the propranolol condition, as compared to the placebo condition, suggesting a potential cognitive benefit of this agent. Additionally, we observed a negative linear relationship between response to propranolol on the anagram task and two measures of baseline autonomic activity, as well as a positive linear relationship between drug response and baseline anxiety.

In addition, previous reports have suggested elevated stress and anxiety in ASD, symptoms that are believed to impact facial scanning patterns. The present pilot study sought to explore the effects of pharmacological intervention via propranolol, a nonselective β-adrenergic antagonist and known anxiolytic, on facial scanning in ASD. Specifically, we wished to determine whether there is an increase in eye contact and a decrease in mouth fixation with administration of propranolol. A sample of 14 participants with ASD and 14 matched controls participated in two study sessions in which propranolol and placebo were administered in a counterbalanced, double-blinded manner. At each session, ocular fixation data were collected during presentation of video stimuli of 16 human faces. Fixation time on the eye, nose, and mouth regions of the face stimuli was analyzed. The baseline fixation patterns for the ASD and control groups did not significantly differ; however, administration of propranolol was associated with a significant reduction in mouth fixation for the ASD group. Additionally, mouth fixation was positively related to nonverbal communication impairment in the ASD group. Although eye fixation in ASD appears typical in the present study, the effect of propranolol in reducing mouth fixation suggests an important focus for further research. Future studies are needed to better characterize the relationship between stress and anxiety and facial scanning in ASD, as well as the effects of pharmacological intervention.","Zamzow Rachel M, Christ Shawn E, Saklayen Sanjida S, Moffitt Amanda J, Bodner Kimberly E, Higgins Katherine F, Beversdorf David Q",Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology,"Adolescent, Adrenergic beta-Antagonists, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Double-Blind Method, Face, Female, Fixation, Ocular, Humans, Male, Pattern Recognition, Visual, Pilot Projects, Propranolol, Social Perception, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24730708,"a Interdisciplinary Neuroscience Program , University of Missouri , Columbia , MO , USA."

The present study examined the effects of pharmacological modulation of the norepinephrine system on the severity of such impairments. A sample of 14 high-functioning adults with ASD and a demographically-matched comparison group of 13 typically developing individuals participated. An AX continuous performance test (AX-CPT) was used to evaluate working memory and inhibitory control. AX-CPT performance was assessed following administration of a single dose of propranolol (a beta adrenergic antagonist) and following placebo (sugar pill) administration. Individuals with ASD performed more poorly than non-ASD individuals in the working memory condition (BX trials). Importantly, administration of propranolol attenuated this impairment, with the ASD group performing significantly better in the propranolol condition than the placebo condition. Working memory performance of the non-ASD group was unaffected by propranolol/placebo administration. No group or medication effects were observed for the inhibition condition (AY trials). The present findings suggest that norepinephrine may play a role in some, but not necessarily all, cognitive impairments associated with ASD.

Preliminary evidence showed possible language benefits in autism from the β-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. Earlier studies in other populations suggested propranolol might benefit performance on tasks involving a search of semantic and associative networks under certain conditions. Therefore, we wished to determine whether this benefit of propranolol includes an effect on semantic fluency in autism. A sample of 14 high-functioning adolescent and adult participants with autism and 14 matched controls were given letter and category word fluency tasks on 2 separate testing sessions; 1 test was given 60 minutes after the administration of 40 mg propranolol orally, and 1 test was given after placebo, administered in a double-blinded, counterbalanced manner. Participants with autism were significantly impaired compared with controls on both fluency tasks. Propranolol significantly improved performance on category fluency, but not letter fluency among autism participants. No drug effect was observed among controls. Expected drug effects on heart rate and blood pressure were observed in both the groups. Results are consistent with a selective beneficial effect of propranolol on flexibility of access to semantic and associative networks in autism, with no observed effect on phonological networks.

Previous research indicates that ASD without intellectual impairment is associated with underactivity and reduced functional connectivity of the brain's mentalizing pathway, to which the right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ) serves as an important entry point and hub. In this study, we aim to utilize functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to localize activation maxima in the rTPJ and other regions involved in social cognition to generate individualized targets for neuro-navigated, intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) in order to modulate brain activity in a region centrally engaged in social information processing. In this single-blind, randomized, between-subject neuroimaging-guided brain stimulation study we plan to recruit 52 participants with prediagnosed ASD and 52 controls without ASD aged between 18 and 65 years. Participants will be classified into two groups and will randomly receive one session of either verum- or sham-iTBS. Effects will be assessed by using well-established experimental tasks that interrogate social behaviour, but also use computational modelling to investigate brain stimulation effects at this level. This study aims to use personalized, non-invasive brain stimulation to alter social information processing in adults with and without high-functioning ASD, which has not been studied before with a similar protocol or a sample size of this magnitude. By doing so in combination with behavioural and computational tasks, this study has the potential to provide new mechanistic insights into the workings of the social brain.

However, no intrastimulation social cognition training for ASD has been developed so far. The objective of this two-armed, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial is to investigate the effects of tDCS combined with a newly developed intrastimulation social cognition training on adolescents with ASD. Twenty-two male adolescents with ASD were randomly assigned to receive 10 sessions of either anodal or sham tDCS at F3/right supraorbital region together with online intrastimulation training comprising basic and complex emotion recognition tasks. Using baseline magnetic resonance imaging data, individual electric field distributions were simulated, and brain activation patterns of the training tasks were analyzed. Additionally, questionnaires were administered at baseline and following the intervention. Compared to sham tDCS, anodal tDCS significantly improved dynamic emotion recognition over the course of the sessions. This task also showed the highest activations in face processing regions. Moreover, the improvement was associated with electric field density at the medial prefrontal cortex and social awareness in exploratory analyses. Both groups showed high tolerability and acceptability of tDCS, and significant improvement in overall ASD symptoms. Taken together, multisession tDCS improved dynamic emotion recognition in adolescents with ASD using a task that activates brain regions associated with the social brain network. The variability in the electric field might diminish tDCS effects and future studies should investigate individualized approaches.","Prillinger Karin, Amador de Lara Gabriel, Klöbl Manfred, Lanzenberger Rupert, Plener Paul L, Poustka Luise, Konicar Lilian, Radev Stefan T",Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics,"Humans, Male, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation, Adolescent, Double-Blind Method, Emotions, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Recognition, Psychology, Child, Social Cognition",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39393982,"Comprehensive Center for Clinical Neuroscience and Mental Health (C3NMH), Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria; Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria; Comprehensive Center for Pediatrics (CCP), Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria; Comprehensive Center for Clinical Neuroscience and Mental Health (C3NMH), Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Ulm, 89073 Ulm, Germany.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, University Hospital Heidelberg, 69115 Heidelberg, Germany.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria; Comprehensive Center for Pediatrics (CCP), Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria; Comprehensive Center for Clinical Neuroscience and Mental Health (C3NMH), Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Cognitive Science Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 12180 Troy, New York, USA; Center for Modeling, Simulation and Imaging in Medicine (CEMSIM), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 12180 Troy, New York, USA.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria; Comprehensive Center for Pediatrics (CCP), Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria; Comprehensive Center for Clinical Neuroscience and Mental Health (C3NMH), Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.

It is characterized by exacerbated neuronal excitability, and its correction is considered an objective measure of treatment response in animal models, a marker albeit rarely used in clinical trials. Here, we used an extensive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) battery to assess the neurophysiological effects of a therapy combining two disease-modifying drugs, lovastatin (40 mg) and minocycline (100 mg), administered alone for 8 weeks and in combination for 12 weeks, in 19 patients (mean age of 23.58 ± 1.51) with FXS taking part in the LOVAmix trial. The TMS battery, which included the resting motor threshold, short-interval intracortical inhibition, long-interval intracortical inhibition, corticospinal silent period, and intracortical facilitation, was completed at baseline after 8 weeks of monotherapy (visit 2 of the clinical trial) and after 12 weeks of dual therapy (visit 4 of the clinical trial). Repeated measure ANOVAs were performed between baseline and visit 2 (monotherapy) and visit 3 (dual therapy) with interactions for which monotherapy the participants received when they began the clinical trial. Results showed that dual therapy was associated with reduced cortical excitability after 20 weeks. This was reflected by a significant increase in the resting-motor threshold after dual therapy compared to baseline. There was a tendency for enhanced short-intracortical inhibition, a marker of GABAa-mediated inhibition after 8 weeks of monotherapy compared to baseline. Together, these results suggest that a combined therapy of minocycline and lovastatin might act on the core neurophysiopathology of FXS.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a promising and emerging tool for the intervention of ASD by reducing both core and associate symptoms. Several reviews have been published regarding TMS-based ASD treatment, however, a systematic review on study characteristics, specific stimulating parameters, localization techniques, stimulated targets, behavioral outcomes, and neuroimage biomarker changes is lagged behind since 2018. Here, we performed a systematic search on literatures published after 2018 in PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct. After screening, the final systematic review included 17 articles, composing seven randomized controlled trial studies and ten open-label studies. Two studies are double-blind, while the other studies have a moderate to high risk of bias attributing to inadequate subject- and evaluator-blinding to treatment allocation. Five studies utilize theta-burst stimulation mode, and the others apply repetitive TMS with low frequency (five studies), high frequency (six studies), and combined low and high frequency stimulation (one study). Most researchers prioritize the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal lobe as stimulation target, while parietal lobule, inferior parietal lobule, and posterior superior temporal sulci have also emerged as new targets of attention. One third of the studies use neuronavigation based on anatomical magnetic resonance imaging to locate the stimulation target. After TMS intervention, discernible enhancements across a spectrum of scales are evident in stereotyped behavior, repetitive behavior, and verbal social domains. A comprehensive review of literature spanning the last five years demonstrates the potential of TMS treatment for ASD in ameliorating the clinical core symptoms.","Yuan Li-Xia, Wang Xing-Ke, Yang Chen, Zhang Qiu-Rong, Ma Sheng-Zhi, Zang Yu-Feng, Dong Wen-Qiang",Heliyon,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38933955,"School of Physics, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.; Center for Cognition and Brain Disorders, The Affiliated Hospital of Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China."

Directed transfer function (DTF) was used to calculate the effective connectivity as a way of investigating differences between ASD and TD children while simultaneously evaluating the effectiveness of rTMS for ASD. The results illustrate that the DTF of TD children in the frontal lobe (Fp1, Fp2, F7, F8) and temporal lobe (T7, T8) is higher than that of ASD children in all frequency bands; however, the DTF of ASD children is higher than TD in the midline (Fz, Cz), central lobe (C3, C4), and parietal lobe (P3, P4).

Our study aimed to explore the impacts of intermittent TBS (iTBS) over the bilateral posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) on intellectually able adults with ASD. In this randomized, single-blinded, sham-controlled crossover trial, 13 adults with ASD completed iTBS for 5 consecutive days over the bilateral pSTS and inion (as a sham control) in a 16-weeks interval and in a randomly assigned order. The neuropsychological function was measured with the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) for cognitive flexibility while the clinical outcomes were measured with both self-rate and parents-rate Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) before and after 5-day iTBS interventions. The results revealed significantly immediate effects of multi-session iTBS over the bilateral pSTS on parent-rate autistic symptoms in adults with ASD. The post-hoc analysis revealed the impacts of multi-session iTBS on cognitive flexibility were affected by baseline social-communicative impairment and baseline cognitive performance. Besides, the impacts of multi-session iTBS on clinical symptoms was affected by the concurrent psychotropic medication use and baseline autistic symptoms. Given the caveat of the small sample size and discrepancy of multiple informants, this pilot study suggests the therapeutic potential of 5-day multi-session iTBS over the pSTS in adults with ASD.

Specifically, autistic people demonstrated hyperplasticity in response to theta-burst stimulation (TBS). We hypothesized that autistic adults would display hyperplasticity to TBS and that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) - which potentiates brain inhibitory mechanisms - would 'stabilize' hyperplasticity. Using a randomized, cross-over design, plasticity was assessed using TBS in the left motor cortex (M1) in 31 autistic adults and 30 sex-, intelligence quotient-, and age-matched controls. Autistic adults (n = 29) were further randomized (1:1) to receive a single session of active (n = 14) or sham (n = 15) rTMS (6000 pulses at 20 Hz) over left M1 and plasticity was reassessed on the next day following rTMS. Both long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) were significantly increased in the ASD group, indicating hyperplasticity. Active, but not sham rTMS, attenuated LTD in autistic adults. We provided further evidence for the presence of brain hyperplasticity in ASD. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show preliminary evidence that an excessive LTD in ASD can be 'stabilized' using rTMS. Such 'stabilizing' effect of rTMS on LTP was not observed, likely due to small sample size or a more specific 'attenuating' effect of rTMS on LTD, compared to LTP. These findings indicate atypical brain inhibitory mechanisms behind hyperplasticity in ASD. Utilizing a larger sample, future replication studies could investigate therapeutic opportunities of 'mechanism-driven' rTMS.","Desarkar Pushpal, Rajji Tarek K, Ameis Stephanie H, Blumberger Daniel M, Lai Meng-Chuan, Lunsky Yona, Daskalakis Zafiris J",Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology,"Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Cross-Over Studies, Female, Humans, Male, Motor Cortex, Neuronal Plasticity, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34011467,"Azrieli Adult Neurodevelopmental Centre, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Psychiatry, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Temerty Centre for Therapeutic Brain Intervention, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada; Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada.

First, we found that continuous 8-week intermittent theta burst stimulation on the bilateral posterior superior temporal sulcus in children with autism is safe and tolerable. Second, we found that 8-week intermittent theta burst stimulation produced greater therapeutic efficacy, although we did not find any significant effects of 4-week intermittent theta burst stimulation on core symptoms and social cognitive performances in autism. Further analysis revealed that participants with higher intelligence and better social cognitive performance, alongside less attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder severity at baseline, were more likely to be responders.

It is still undetermined whether it is possible to improve the social function of ALT individuals through noninvasive neural modulation.

The real group showed significant improvement in emotion recognition accuracy after iTBS, but the change was not significantly larger than that in the sham group. Resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) between the rpSTS and the left cerebellum significantly decreased in the real group than the sham group after iTBS. At baseline, rsFC in the left cerebellum was negatively correlated with emotion recognition accuracy. Our findings indicated that iTBS of the rpSTS could improve emotion perception of ALT individuals by modulating associated neural networks.

Outcome measures evaluated protocol feasibility and clinical effects of active vs. sham rTMS on EF performance. The moderating effect of baseline functioning was explored. Of eligible participants, 95% were enrolled and 95% of randomized participants completed the protocol. Adverse events across treatment arms were mild-to-moderate. There was no significant difference between active vs. sham rTMS on EF performance. Baseline adaptive functioning moderated the effect of rTMS, such that participants with lower baseline functioning experienced significant EF improvement in the active vs. sham group. Our pilot RCT demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of using high frequency rTMS targeting DLPFC in youth and young adults with autism. No evidence for efficacy of active versus sham rTMS on EF performance was found. However, we found promising preliminary evidence of EF performance improvement following active versus sham rTMS in participants with ASD with more severe adaptive functioning deficits.

This article will outline the design of a novel randomized-controlled trial of bilateral, 20 Hz, rTMS applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for treatment of EF deficits in ASD that is currently ongoing. We describe prior therapeutic rTMS research for ASD and prior rTMS trials targeting EFs in adult neuropsychiatric disorders. A neurophysiological rationale for rTMS treatment of EF deficits in ASD is presented. An ongoing protocol will enroll participants aged 16-35 with ASD and no intellectual disability. Psychotropic medications will be continued during the 4-week trial of active 20 Hz versus sham rTMS applied to the DLPFC. Twenty, active treatment sessions consisting of 25 stimulation trains at a 90% motor threshold will be administered. The primary outcome measure is the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) spatial working memory task. At present, recruitment, enrollment, and treatment within the described clinical trial are ongoing. EF deficits are common and impairing symptoms of ASD.

Several reports indicate that children with ASD show reduced error processing and deficient behavioral correction after an error is committed. Error sensitivity can be readily examined by measuring event-related potentials (ERP) associated with responses to errors, the fronto-central error-related negativity (ERN), and the error-related positivity (Pe). The goal of our study was to investigate whether reaction time (RT), error rate, post-error RT change, ERN, and Pe will show positive changes following 12-week long slow frequency repetitive TMS (rTMS) over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in high functioning children with ASD. We hypothesized that 12 sessions of 1 Hz rTMS bilaterally applied over the DLPFC will result in improvements reflected in both behavioral and ERP measures. Participants were randomly assigned to either active rTMS treatment or wait-list (WTL) groups. Baseline and post-TMS/or WTL EEG was collected using 128 channel EEG system. The task involved the recognition of a specific illusory shape, in this case a square or triangle, created by three or four inducer disks. ERN in TMS treatment group became significantly more negative. The number of omission errors decreased post-TMS. The RT did not change, but post-error RT became slower. There were no changes in RT, error rate, post-error RT slowing, nor in ERN/Pe measures in the wait-list group. Our results show significant post-TMS differences in the response-locked ERP such as ERN, as well as behavioral response monitoring measures indicative of improved error monitoring and correction function. The ERN and Pe, along with behavioral performance measures, can be used as functional outcome measures to assess the effectiveness of neuromodulation (e.g., rTMS) in children with autism and thus may have important practical implications.","Sokhadze Estate M, Baruth Joshua M, Sears Lonnie, Sokhadze Guela E, El-Baz Ayman S, Casanova Manuel F",Applied psychophysiology and biofeedback,"Adolescent, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child Behavior, Data Interpretation, Statistical, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Electroencephalography, Electrooculography, Evoked Potentials, Female, Humans, Intelligence Tests, Male, Neuropsychological Tests, Prefrontal Cortex, Psychomotor Performance, Reaction Time, Self Concept, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22311204,"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Louisville School of Medicine, KY 40202, USA. tato.sokhadze@louisville.edu"

Our hypothesis was that low-frequency rTMS application to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC) would result in an alteration of the cortical excitatory/inhibitory balance through the activation of inhibitory GABAergic double bouquet interneurons. We expected to find post-TMS differences in amplitude and latency of early and late ERP components. The results of our current study validate the use of low-frequency rTMS as a modulatory tool that altered the disrupted ratio of cortical excitation to inhibition in autism. After rTMS the parieto-occipital P50 amplitude decreased to novel distracters but not to targets; also the amplitude and latency to targets increased for the frontal P50 while decreasing to non-target stimuli. Low-frequency rTMS minimized early cortical responses to irrelevant stimuli and increased responses to relevant stimuli. Improved selectivity in early cortical responses lead to better stimulus differentiation at later-stage responses as was made evident by our P3b and P3a component findings. These results indicate a significant change in early, middle-latency and late ERP components at the frontal, centro-parietal, and parieto-occipital regions of interest in response to target and distracter stimuli as a result of rTMS treatment. Overall, our preliminary results show that rTMS may prove to be an important research tool or treatment modality in addressing the stimulus hypersensitivity characteristic of autism spectrum disorders.","Sokhadze Estate, Baruth Joshua, Tasman Allan, Mansoor Mehreen, Ramaswamy Rajesh, Sears Lonnie, Mathai Grace, El-Baz Ayman, Casanova Manuel F",Applied psychophysiology and biofeedback,"Adolescent, Adult, Autistic Disorder, Behavior, Cerebral Cortex, Child, Electroencephalography, Evoked Potentials, Female, Humans, Hyperkinesis, Interneurons, Male, Mental Processes, Photic Stimulation, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Reaction Time, Social Behavior, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19941058,"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY, 40292, USA. tato.sokhadze@louisville.edu"

Among associated symptoms of ASD, management of irritability has gained considerable attention as it complicates adjustment of ASD patients and thus necessitates its pharmacological treatment. Resveratrol is a plant phytoalexin, which has been demonstrated to have neuroprotective effects through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial was designed to assess the potential therapeutic effects of resveratrol plus risperidone on irritability of ASD patients. Sixty-two patients were assigned randomly into two groups of resveratrol and placebo. Both groups were treated with risperidone twice daily starting at a dose of 0.5 mg with a dose increase of 0.5 mg per week (for the first 3 weeks). Resveratrol dosage was 250 mg twice per day from the beginning of the study. Using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C), patients were assessed for ASD-related behavioural symptoms at baseline, week 5 and week 10. The frequency of adverse events was recorded using a checklist containing 25 possible side effects, including general, gastrointestinal, neurological and cardiovascular complications. Improvements in primary outcome measure (irritability) and three secondary outcome measures (lethargy/social withdrawal, stereotypic behaviour and inappropriate speech subscales) in the resveratrol group were statistically similar to those in the placebo group. The repeated measures analysis showed no time × treatment interaction on these subscale scores. In contrast, patients in the resveratrol group showed greater decline in hyperactivity/non-compliance score as a secondary outcome measure (mean difference [CI = 95%] = 4.51 [0.10-8.92], t = 2.04; P = .04), and repeated measures analysis showed significant effect for time × treatment effect on this subscale score (F = 3.81; df = 1.30; P = .043). There was no significant difference in number and severity of adverse events between the two groups.

This study examined the effects of risperidone on cardiac conduction in children with ASD. Data were collected from an 8-week, five-site trial conducted by the Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology Autism Network. Children (age 5-17 years) were randomly assigned to risperidone (n = 49) or placebo (n = 52) under double-blind conditions. Risperidone was superior to placebo in reducing serious behavioral problems. A standard 12-lead, electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained in most subjects at screening and week 8. A pediatric electrophysiologist blind to treatment assignment reviewed all available ECGs for readability, abnormalities, and cardiac conduction parameters, including QTc. The electrophysiologist measurements were compared to machine readings. A second blinded electrophysiologist examined all available ECGs for abnormalities and a 20% random sample for QTc. Of the 101 randomized subjects in the trial, complete pretreatment and week 8 data were available on 65 subjects (placebo n = 30; risperidone n = 35). The electrophysiologist did not identify any cardiac conduction adverse effects of risperidone and there was no difference in mean change on the QTc compared to placebo. The Bland-Altman plot showed a systematic bias in QTc measurements by the electrophysiologist and machine. Machine readings produced higher values than the electrophysiologist for shorter QTc intervals and machine scoring was lower than electrophysiologist readings for longer QTc values (p = 0.001). Two electrophysiologists had overall percent agreements of 82.9% (95% CI: 76.3 to 89.6) on qualitative assessment and 88.6% (95% CI: 79.3 to 98.0) on QTc interval. Using conventional doses during acute treatment in children with ASD and serious behavioral problems, there was no difference in the mean change in QTc between risperidone and placebo.

We monitored height, weight, waist circumference, and adverse effects during the trial. Fasting blood samples were obtained before treatment and at week 16. In 97 children with a mean of 22.9 ± 2.8 weeks of risperidone exposure, there was a 5.4 ± 3.4 kg weight gain over 24 weeks (p < .0001); waist circumference increased from 60.7 ± 10.4 cm to 66.8 ± 11.3 cm (p < .0001). At baseline, 59 of 97 children (60.8%) were classified as having normal weight; by week 24, only 25 of 85 (29.4%) remained in that group. Growth curve analysis showed a significant change in body mass index (BMI) z scores from pretreatment to week 24 (p < .0001). This effect was significantly greater for children with reported increased appetite in the first 8 weeks. From before treatment to week 16, there were significant increases in glucose (p = .02), hemoglobin A1c (p = .01), insulin (p <.0001), homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; p < .001), alanine aminotransferase (p = .01), and leptin (p < .0001).

Participants were from the NIMH funded RUPP multisite, randomized, double-blind trial that compared risperidone to placebo to treat autistic disorder with severe tantrums, aggression, or self-injury. Participants were aged 5 to 17, and randomly assigned to risperidone (n=49) or placebo (n=52). Baseline and change scores were computed with the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) parent assessed scales with irritability as the primary outcome, as well as the clinician assessed ABC Irritability subscale, and Clinical Global Impression Scale. The relationship between baseline severity and change scores for the risperdone and placebo groups was examined with eight competing three-level mixed-effects models for repeated measure models. Significant (P<0.01) interactions between treatment and baseline severity were observed for parent ABC ratings of irritability and lethargy only. Greater magnitudes of the differences between risperidone and placebo were observed from moderate to very severe baseline severity on irritability and lethargy.

We examined the tolerability, safety, and therapeutic benefit of risperidone exposure over a 1-2 year follow-up period. In a naturalistic study, 84 children and adolescents 5-17 years of age (from an original sample of 101) were assessed an average of 21.4 months after initial entry into a placebo-controlled 8 week trial of risperidone for children and adolescents with autism and severe irritability. They were assessed at baseline and at follow-up on safety and tolerability measures (blood, urinalysis, electrocardiogram [ECG], medical history, vital signs, neurological symptoms, other adverse events), developmental measures (adaptive behavior, intelligence quotient [IQ]), and standardized rating instruments. Treatment over the follow-up period, after completion of protocol participation, was uncontrolled. Statistical analyses assessed outcome over time with or without prolonged risperidone therapy. Two-thirds of the 84 subjects continued to receive risperidone (mean 2.47 mg/day, S.D. 1.29 mg). At follow-up, risperidone was associated with more enuresis, more excessive appetite, and more weight gain, but not more adverse neurological effects. No clinically significant events were noted on blood counts, chemistries, urinalysis, ECG, or interim medical history. Regardless of drug condition at follow-up, there was considerable improvement in maladaptive behavior compared with baseline, including core symptoms associated with autism. Height and weight gains were elevated with risperidone. Social skills on Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS) improved with risperidone. Parent-rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) Irritability subscale scores were reduced in those taking risperidone at follow-up. Several other measures of maladaptive behavior (some related to socialization) also showed improved functioning in association with risperidone on the ABC or on the Modified Real Life Rating Scale. Increased appetite, weight gain, and enuresis are risks associated with long-term risperidone.

Whereas the safety and efficacy of risperidone have been established for children aged 5 and older, they has not been adequately tested in preschool children. A randomized placebo-controlled study of risperidone in preschool children was conducted in a sample of young children, most of whom were also undergoing intensive behavioral treatment. Preschool children tolerated low-dose risperidone well with no serious adverse effects observed over a 6-month treatment period. Weight gain and hypersalivation were the most common side effects reported, and hyperprolactinemia without lactation or related signs was observed. Significant differences between groups found at baseline complicated the analyses; however, controlling for some of these differences revealed that preschoolers on risperidone demonstrated greater improvements in autism severity. The change in autism severity scores from baseline to 6-month follow up for the risperidone group was 8% compared to 3% for the placebo group. Notably, both groups significantly improved over the 6-month treatment period. Study findings suggest that risperidone is well tolerated in preschoolers over a 6-month period, but that only minimally greater improvement in target symptoms was evident in the risperidone group, possibly due to the differences between groups at baseline or due to the small sample size. Although these findings are not sufficient to direct treatment, they suggest that larger-scale, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigations of risperidone in preschoolers with ASDs should now be conducted.","Luby Joan, Mrakotsky Christine, Stalets Melissa Meade, Belden Andy, Heffelfinger Amy, Williams Meghan, Spitznagel Edward",Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology,"Antipsychotic Agents, Anxiety, Autistic Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Child Behavior Disorders, Child, Preschool, Combined Modality Therapy, Depression, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Double-Blind Method, Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions, Early Intervention, Educational, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Hyperprolactinemia, Male, Personality Assessment, Risperidone, Sialorrhea, Weight Gain",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17069546,"Department of Psychiatry, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63117, USA. lubyj@msnotes.wustl.edu"

Part I consisted of 4-month open-label treatment with risperidone, starting at the established optimal dose; part II was an 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-substitution study of risperidone withdrawal. Primary outcome measures were the Aberrant Behavior Checklist irritability subscale and the Clinical Global Impression improvement scale. Part I included 63 children. The mean risperidone dose was 1.96 mg/day at entry and remained stable over 16 weeks of open treatment. The change on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist irritability subscale was small and clinically insignificant. Reasons for discontinuation of part I included loss of efficacy (N=5) and adverse effects (N=1). The subjects gained an average of 5.1 kg. Part II included 32 patients. The relapse rates were 62.5% for gradual placebo substitution and 12.5% for continued risperidone; this difference was statistically significant.

We conducted a multisite, randomized, double-blind trial of risperidone as compared with placebo for the treatment of autistic disorder accompanied by severe tantrums, aggression, or self-injurious behavior in children 5 to 17 years old. The primary outcome measures were the score on the Irritability subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist and the rating on the Clinical Global Impressions - Improvement (CGI-I) scale at eight weeks. A total of 101 children (82 boys and 19 girls; mean [+/-SD] age, 8.8+/-2.7 years) were randomly assigned to receive risperidone (49 children) or placebo (52).

Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology.,2000-04-01,"Assessment of autistic disorder (autism) symptoms, primary and secondary, poses more challenging problems than ordinarily found in multisite randomized clinical trial (RCT) assessments. For example, subjects may be uncommunicative and extremely heterogeneous in problem presentation, and current pharmacological treatments are not likely to alter most core features of autism. The Autism Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology (RUPP Autism Network) resolved some of these problems during the design of a risperidone RCT in children/adolescents. The inappropriateness of the usual anchors for a Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) was resolved by defining uncomplicated autism without secondary symptoms as a CGI-S of 3, mildly ill. The communication problems, compromising use of the patient as an informant, were addressed by several strategies, including careful questioning of care providers, rating scales, laboratory tests, and physical exams. The broad subject heterogeneity requires outcome measures sensitive to individual change over a wide spectrum of treatment response and side effects. The problems of neuropsychologically testing nonverbal, lower functioning, sometimes noncompliant subjects requires careful instrument selection/adaptation and flexible administration techniques. The problems of assessing low-end IQs, neglected by most standardized test developers, was resolved by an algorithm of test hierarchy. Scarcity of other autism-adapted cognitive and neuropsychological tests and lack of standardization required development of a new, specially adapted battery. Reliability on the Autism Diagnostic Interview (currently the most valid diagnostic instrument) and other clinician instruments required extensive cross-site training (in-person, videotape, and teleconference sessions). Definition of a treatment responder required focus on individually relevant target symptoms, synthesis of possible modest improvements in many domains, and acceptance of attainable though imperfect goals. The assessment strategy developed is implemented in a RCT of risperidone (McDougle et al., 2000) for which the design and other methodological challenges are described elsewhere (Scahill et al., 2000).

A significant association was observed between a BDNF polymorphism and improvements for several clinical measures, including the Clinical Global Impression scale (P=0.008) and the cognitive T score (P=0.017) in those treated with sertraline compared to those in the placebo group. Additionally, polymorphisms in the MAOA, Cytochrome P450 2C19 and 2D6, and in the 5-HTTLPR gene showed a significant correlation with some of the secondary measures included in this study. This study shows that polymorphisms of genes involved in the serotonergic pathway could play a potential role in predicting response to sertraline treatment in young children with FXS. Larger studies are warranted to confirm these initial findings.","AlOlaby Reem Rafik, Sweha Stefan R, Silva Marisol, Durbin-Johnson Blythe, Yrigollen Carolyn M, Pretto Dalyir, Hagerman Randi J, Tassone Flora",Brain & development,"Autism Spectrum Disorder, Biomarkers, Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor, Child, Child, Preschool, Cohort Studies, Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System, Double-Blind Method, Female, Fragile X Syndrome, Genotype, Humans, Male, Matrix Metalloproteinase 9, Monoamine Oxidase, Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, Sertraline, Severity of Illness Index",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28242040,"MIND Institute, University of California Davis Medical Center, Davis, CA, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of California, Davis, School of Medicine, Davis, CA, USA.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, University of California, Davis, School of Medicine, Davis, CA, USA; MIND Institute, University of California Davis Medical Center, Davis, CA, USA.

The authors evaluated the efficacy of 6 months of treatment with low-dose sertraline in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 52 children with FXS aged 2 to 6 years. Eighty-one subjects were screened for eligibility, and 57 were randomized to sertraline (27) or placebo (30). Two subjects from the sertraline arm and 3 from the placebo arm discontinued. Intent-to-treat analysis showed no difference from placebo on the primary outcomes: the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) expressive language (EL) age equivalent and Clinical Global Impression Scale-Improvement. However, analyses of secondary measures showed significant improvements, particularly in motor and visual perceptual abilities and social participation. Sertraline was well tolerated, with no difference in side effects between sertraline and placebo groups. No serious adverse events occurred. This randomized controlled trial of 6 months of sertraline treatment showed no primary benefit with respect to early EL development and global clinical improvement. However, in secondary exploratory analyses, there were significant improvements seen on motor and visual perceptual subtests, the cognitive T score sum on the MSEL, and on one measure of social participation on the Sensory Processing Measure-Preschool. Furthermore, post hoc analysis found significant improvement in early EL development as measured by the MSEL among children with autism spectrum disorder on sertraline. Treatment appears safe for this 6-month period in young children with FXS, but the authors do not know the long-term side effects of this treatment. These results warrant further studies of sertraline in young children with FXS using refined outcome measures as well as longer term follow-up studies to address long-term side effects of low-dose sertraline in early childhood.","Greiss Hess Laura, Fitzpatrick Sarah E, Nguyen Danh V, Chen Yanjun, Gaul Kimberly N, Schneider Andrea, Lemons Chitwood Kerrie, Eldeeb Marwa Abd Al Azaim, Polussa Jonathan, Hessl David, Rivera Susan, Hagerman Randi J",Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP,"Child, Child, Preschool, Double-Blind Method, Female, Fragile X Syndrome, Humans, Male, Outcome Assessment, Health Care, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, Sertraline",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27560971,"*Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders (MIND) Institute, University of California, Davis Medical Center, Sacramento, CA; †Department of Occupational Therapy, Dominican University of California, San Rafael, CA; ‡Department of Neuroscience, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH; §Department of Medicine, University of California, Irvine School of Medicine, Orange, CA; ‖Institute for Clinical and Translational Science, University of California, Irvine, CA; ¶Department of Psychology, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA; **Department of Pediatrics, University of California, Davis Medical Center, Sacramento, CA; ††Department of Special Education, California State University, Monterey Bay, CA; ‡‡Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of California, Davis Medical Center, Sacramento, CA."

Previous clinical trials of oral SF demonstrated positive clinical effects on behavior in young men and changes in urinary metabolomics in children with ASD. We conducted a 15-week randomized parallel double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial with 15-week open-label treatment and 6-week no-treatment extensions in 57 children, ages 3-12 years, with ASD over 36 weeks. Twenty-eight were assigned SF and 29 received placebo (PL). Clinical effects, safety and tolerability of SF were measured as were biomarkers to elucidate mechanisms of action of SF in ASD. Data from 22 children taking SF and 23 on PL were analyzed. Treatment effects on the primary outcome measure, the Ohio Autism Clinical Impressions Scale (OACIS), in the general level of autism were not significant between SF and PL groups at 7 and 15 weeks. The effect sizes on the OACIS were non-statistically significant but positive, suggesting a possible trend toward greater improvement in those on treatment with SF (Cohen's d 0.21; 95% CI - 0.46, 0.88 and 0.10; 95% CI - 0.52, 0.72, respectively). Both groups improved in all subscales when on SF during the open-label phase. Caregiver ratings on secondary outcome measures improved significantly on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) at 15 weeks (Cohen's d - 0.96; 95% CI - 1.73, - 0.15), but not on the Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2). Ratings on the ABC and SRS-2 improved with a non-randomized analysis of the length of exposure to SF, compared to the pre-treatment baseline (p < 0.001). There were significant changes with SF compared to PL in biomarkers of glutathione redox status, mitochondrial respiration, inflammatory markers and heat shock proteins. Clinical laboratory studies confirmed product safety. SF was very well tolerated and side effects of treatment, none serious, included rare insomnia, irritability and intolerance of the taste and smell. The sample size was limited to 45 children with ASD and we did not impute missing data. We were unable to document significant changes in clinical assessments during clinical visits in those taking SF compared to PL. The clinical results were confounded by placebo effects during the open-label phase. SF led to small yet non-statistically significant changes in the total and all subscale scores of the primary outcome measure, while for secondary outcome measures, caregivers' assessments of children taking SF showed statistically significant improvements compared to those taking PL on the ABC but not the SRS-2. Clinical effects of SF were less notable in children compared to our previous trial of a SF-rich preparation in young men with ASD. Several of the effects of SF on biomarkers correlated to clinical improvements. SF was very well tolerated and safe and effective based on our secondary clinical measures.

Sulforaphane, a supplement with indirect antioxidant effects that are derived from broccoli sprouts and seeds, was recently shown to lead to improvements in behavior and social responsiveness in children with ASD. We conducted the current open-label study to determine if we could identify changes in urinary metabolites that were associated with clinical improvements with the goal of identifying a potential mechanism of action. Children and young adults enrolled in a school for children with ASD and related neurodevelopmental disorders were recruited to participate in a 12-week, open-label study of sulforaphane. Fasting urinary metabolites and measures of behavior (Aberrant Behavior Checklist-ABC) and social responsiveness (Social Responsiveness Scale-SRS) were measured at baseline and at the end of the study. Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated for the pre- to post-intervention change in each of the two clinical scales (ABS and SRS) versus the change in each metabolite. Fifteen children completed the 12-week study. Mean scores on both symptom measures showed improvements (decreases) over the study period, but only the change in the SRS was significant. The ABC improved - 7.1 points (95% CI - 17.4 to 3.2), and the SRS improved - 9.7 points (95% CI - 18.7 to - 0.8). We identified 77 urinary metabolites that were correlated with changes in symptoms, and they clustered into pathways of oxidative stress, amino acid/gut microbiome, neurotransmitters, hormones, and sphingomyelin metabolism. Urinary metabolomics analysis is a useful tool to identify pathways that may be involved in the mechanism of action of treatments targeting abnormal physiology in ASD.

The medico-economic burdens of ASD are enormous, and no recognized treatment targets the core features of ASD. In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial, young men (aged 13-27) with moderate to severe ASD received the phytochemical sulforaphane (n = 29)--derived from broccoli sprout extracts--or indistinguishable placebo (n = 15). The effects on behavior of daily oral doses of sulforaphane (50-150 µmol) for 18 wk, followed by 4 wk without treatment, were quantified by three widely accepted behavioral measures completed by parents/caregivers and physicians: the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), and Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale (CGI-I). Initial scores for ABC and SRS were closely matched for participants assigned to placebo and sulforaphane. After 18 wk, participants receiving placebo experienced minimal change (<3.3%), whereas those receiving sulforaphane showed substantial declines (improvement of behavior): 34% for ABC (P < 0.001, comparing treatments) and 17% for SRS scores (P = 0.017). On CGI-I, a significantly greater number of participants receiving sulforaphane had improvement in social interaction, abnormal behavior, and verbal communication (P = 0.015-0.007). Upon discontinuation of sulforaphane, total scores on all scales rose toward pretreatment levels. Dietary sulforaphane, of recognized low toxicity, was selected for its capacity to reverse abnormalities that have been associated with ASD, including oxidative stress and lower antioxidant capacity, depressed glutathione synthesis, reduced mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation, increased lipid peroxidation, and neuroinflammmation.","Singh Kanwaljit, Connors Susan L, Macklin Eric A, Smith Kirby D, Fahey Jed W, Talalay Paul, Zimmerman Andrew W",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"Adolescent, Adult, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Humans, Isothiocyanates, Male, Placebos, Social Behavior, Sulfoxides, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25313065,"Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Lewis B. and Dorothy Cullman Chemoprotection Center, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205 ptalalay@jhmi.edu Andrew.Zimmerman@umassmemorial.org.; Lurie Center for Autism, Department of Pediatrics, Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, Harvard Medical School, Lexington, MA 02421; Department of Pediatrics (Neurology), University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01655;; McKusick-Nathans Institute for Genetic Medicine and.; Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Lewis B. and Dorothy Cullman Chemoprotection Center, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205.; Lurie Center for Autism, Department of Pediatrics, Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, Harvard Medical School, Lexington, MA 02421; Department of Pediatrics (Neurology), University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01655; ptalalay@jhmi.edu Andrew.Zimmerman@umassmemorial.org.; Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital Biostatistics Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114; and.; Lurie Center for Autism, Department of Pediatrics, Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, Harvard Medical School, Lexington, MA 02421;"

This multicenter, double-blind, 2-armed, sham-controlled randomized clinical trial, conducted from May 1, 2022, through November 30, 2023, assessed children aged 3 to 14 years with ASD at 8 medical centers in China. Participants underwent daily 20-minute sessions of active tPCS (0.7 mA) or sham tPCS (brief 0.7 mA ramp-up and ramp-down) for 20 sessions over 4 weeks with anode over the right cerebellar hemisphere and cathode over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (12.56-cm2-circular, 4-cm-diameter circular electrodes). Each day after tPCS, all participants received 1 hour of standard therapy. Social functioning was assessed using the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included the Autism Behavior Checklist and the Childhood Sleep Habits Questionnaire. A total of 312 participants (155 in the active group and 157 in the sham group; 248 [79.5%] boys; mean [SD] age, 5.1 [1.6] years; 276 [88.5%] aged 3-6 years and 36 [11.5%] aged 7-14 years) completed the trial. After 20 sessions, the mean Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist total score improved by 4.13 points (5.8%) in the sham tPCS group and 7.17 points (10.7%) in the active tPCS group. Analysis of covariance showed significantly greater improvement in the active tPCS group (difference, -3.50; 95% CI, -5.56 to -1.43; P < .001). Both treatments were well tolerated.

Therapies specifically targeting RBs have been underexplored despite advances in understanding their neurobiological basis. This study aims to evaluate whether high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) can reduce dysfunctional RBs in autistic children and investigate whether improvements differ between lower-order and higher-order RBs based on the brain regions stimulated. The study entails a multi-session, sham-controlled, site-controlled, double-blind, and between-subjects design. The study will include participants with an ASD diagnosis (aged 8-13 years; IQ ≥ 70), who will undergo the HD-tDCS intervention for 10 sessions. Participants will be randomly assigned to three conditions: (1) Pre-Motor Active Group (active HD-tDCS over pre-SMA cortex); (2) Frontal Active Group (active HD-tDCS over dlPFC); (3) Placebo Control Group. In the active HD-tDCS conditions, the current will be delivered through a 4 × 1 montage; small circular electrodes will be used with the cathode placed centrally with a current intensity of 0.5 mA for a total of 20 min (30 s ramp up/down) per session. Participants during the sham condition will undergo the same procedures as those in the both active conditions actual placement of electrodes, and turning on the HD-tDCS equipment (30 s). The assessment will be completed at baseline (T0), immediately after the end of the intervention (T1) and 3 months after the end of the intervention (T2). The primary outcome measure will be the Total Score of the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised. The secondary outcomes measures will comprise ASD symptoms, sensory processing pattern, emotional/behavioral problems, sleep functioning, parental stress, neuropsychological features and High-Density EEG connectivity. We hypothesize that active HD-tDCS will lead to significant reduction in the total score of the primary outcome compared to Sham Group, with site-specific effects on lower-order and higher-order RBs. HD-tDCS is an easy-to-deliver, time-efficient, neurobiologically-driven intervention that could be performed as add-on to reduce the time of conventional therapy for ASD. Given the inherent limitations of specific interventions for RBs, tDCS represents an important ""third"" treatment arm to address the burden of interventions for ASD.

In recent years, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been applied in interventions for ASD, often targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). However, studies investigating anodal and cathodal tDCS interventions have reported differing outcomes. Therefore, this study aimed to compare and analyze the effects of these two stimulations through a randomized controlled trial, utilizing both behavioral assessments and EEG proxy markers capable of characterizing the brain's excitatory-inhibitory balance. This study recruited a total of 24 children with ASD (20 males and 4 females; mean age ± SD: 5.5 ± 1.2 years), who were randomly divided into two groups receiving either anodal or cathodal tDCS targeting the DLPFC. The stimulation intensity was set at 1 mA, administered five times per week for a total of 20 sessions. Behavioral intervention outcomes were assessed using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and the Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC). Additionally, the study evaluated the effects of tDCS on the brain's excitatory-inhibitory balance by analyzing corrected periodic alpha oscillation power and bandwidth, as well as non-periodic exponent and offset derived from EEG data. Following anodal tDCS intervention, results from the SRS scale indicated a decrease in overall scores, with significant differences observed in social communication and social motivation among children. On the ABC scale, overall scores also decreased, with significant differences noted in sensory behavior, social relating, body and object use, and language and communication skills. Non-periodic exponent and offsets increased following anodal tDCS stimulation, whereas they decreased after cathodal tDCS stimulation. Regarding alpha oscillation power, there was a significant increase following anodal tDCS and a significant decrease following cathodal tDCS. In terms of alpha oscillation bandwidth, there was a reduction following anodal tDCS and an increase following cathodal tDCS. Further correlation analysis revealed that in children who received anodal tDCS intervention, non-periodic exponent showed correlations with behaviors such as social communication. Our study results demonstrated that anodal and cathodal tDCS targeting the left DLPFC had distinct effects on the behavior and excitatory-inhibitory balance of children with ASD. Anodal tDCS intervention appeared to have a more positive impact compared to cathodal intervention. However, the sample size was small, and we focused solely on the effects of tDCS, with our experimental design perhaps not being able to generalize to all external manipulations of excitability in our study. In future research, we will continue to improve the experiments to address these limitations.","Kang Jiannan, Wu Juanmei, Huang Xinping, Mao Wenqin, Li Xiaoli",IBRO neuroscience reports,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39896718,"Child Rehabilitation Division, Ningbo Rehabilitation Hospital, Ningbo, China.; State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Beijing, China."

The combination of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and inhibitory control training produces good transfer effects and improves neuroplasticity. However, no studies have explored whether applying tDCS over the dlPFC improves inhibitory control and produces transfer effects in children with ASD. To explore whether multisession tDCS could enhance inhibitory control training (response inhibition), near-transfer (interference control) and far-transfer effects (sustained attention; stability of attention) in children with ASD and the generalizability of training effects in daily life and the class, as reflected by behavioral performance and neural activity measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Twenty-eight autistic children were randomly assigned to either the true or sham tDCS group. The experimental group received bifrontal tDCS stimulation at 1.5 mA, administered for 15 min daily across eight consecutive days. tDCS was delivered during a computerized Go/No-go training task. Behavioral performance in terms of inhibitory control (Dog/Monkey and Day/Night Stroop tasks), sustained attention (Continuous Performance and Cancellation tests), prefrontal cortex (PFC) neural activity and inhibitory control and sustained attention in the class and at home were evaluated. Training (response inhibition) and transfer effects (interference control; sustained attention) were significantly greater after receiving tDCS during the Go/No-go training task than after receiving sham tDCS. Changes in oxyhemoglobin (HbO) concentrations in the dlPFC and FPA associated with consistent conditions in the Day/Night Stroop and Continuous Performance test were observed after applying tDCS during the inhibitory control training task. Notably, transfer effects can be generalized to classroom environments.

It facilitates empathy, emotion regulation, and prosocial commitment. Mental disorders characterized by social interaction dysfunction, such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD), and Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), often exhibit atypical synchronization with others across multiple levels. With the introduction of the ""second-person"" neuroscience perspective, our understanding of interpersonal neural synchronization (INS) has improved, however, so far, it has hardly impacted the development of novel therapeutic interventions. To evaluate the potential of INS-based treatments for mental disorders, we performed two systematic literature searches identifying studies that directly target INS through neurofeedback (12 publications; 9 independent studies) or brain stimulation techniques (7 studies), following PRISMA guidelines. In addition, we narratively review indirect INS manipulations through behavioral, biofeedback, or hormonal interventions. We discuss the potential of such treatments for ASD, RAD, and SAD and using a systematic database search assess the acceptability of neurofeedback (4 studies) and neurostimulation (4 studies) in patients with social dysfunction. Although behavioral approaches, such as engaging in eye contact or cooperative actions, have been shown to be associated with increased INS, little is known about potential long-term consequences of such interventions. Few proof-of-concept studies have utilized brain stimulation techniques, like transcranial direct current stimulation or INS-based neurofeedback, showing feasibility and preliminary evidence that such interventions can boost behavioral synchrony and social connectedness. Yet, optimal brain stimulation protocols and neurofeedback parameters are still undefined. For ASD, RAD, or SAD, so far no randomized controlled trial has proven the efficacy of direct INS-based intervention techniques, although in general brain stimulation and neurofeedback methods seem to be well accepted in these patient groups. Significant work remains to translate INS-based manipulations into effective treatments for social interaction disorders. Future research should focus on mechanistic insights into INS, technological advancements, and rigorous design standards. Furthermore, it will be key to compare interventions directly targeting INS to those targeting other modalities of synchrony as well as to define optimal target dyads and target synchrony states in clinical interventions.","Konrad Kerstin, Gerloff Christian, Kohl Simon H, Mehler David M A, Mehlem Lena, Volbert Emily L, Komorek Maike, Henn Alina T, Boecker Maren, Weiss Eileen, Reindl Vanessa",Frontiers in neuroscience,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38529267,"Child Neuropsychology Section, Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy, University Hospital RWTH, Aachen, Germany.; Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, Medical School, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany."

Thirty-six children with ASD (aged 4-14) years old were divided equally and randomly into a tDCS treatment group, which underwent 10 sessions (20-min duration, five sessions/per week) of bilateral anodal tDCS stimulation applied over left and right cerebellar hemispheres, and control group underwent the same procedures, but with sham tDCS stimulation. Resting-state brain complexity was evaluated through recording and calculating the approximate entropy (ApxEnt) values of the resting-state electroencephalograph (EEG) data obtained from a 64-channel EEG system before and after the interventions. Repeated measures of ANOVA showed that tDCS had significant effects on the treatment group (Wilks' Lambda = 0.29, F (15, 16) = 2.67, p = 0.03) compared with the control group. Analyzed data showed a significant increase in the averaged ApxEnt values in the right frontal cortical region (F (1, 16) = 10.46, p = 0.005) after the bilateral cerebellar anodal tDCS stimulation. Besides, the Cohen's d effect size showed a large effect size (0.70-0.92) of bilateral cerebellar anodal tDCS on the ApxEnt values increases in the left and right frontal cortical regions, the right central cortical region, and left parietal cortical region. However, there were no any significant differences or increases in the brain complexity before and after the sham tDCS stimulation of the control group.

One of these approaches is modulation of activity of the brain regions involved in ASD symptoms. This study examined the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on autism symptom severity, theory of mind, emotion regulation strategies, and emotional-behavioral functions in children with ASD. Thirty-two children (M<sub>age</sub>  = 10.16, SD = 1.93, range 7-12 years) diagnosed with ASD were randomly assigned to active (N = 17) or sham stimulation (N = 15) groups in a randomized, sham-controlled, parallel-group design. Participants underwent 10 sessions of active (1.5 mA, 15 min, bilateral left anodal/right cathodal DLPFC, 2 sessions per week) or sham tDCS. Autism symptom severity, theory of mind, emotion regulation strategies, and emotional-behavioral functioning of the patients were assessed at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and 1 month after the intervention. A significant improvement of autism symptom severity (i.e., communication), theory of mind (i.e., ToM 3), and emotion regulation strategies was observed for the active as compared to the sham stimulation group at the end of the intervention, and these effects were maintained at the one-month follow-up. The results suggest that repeated tDCS with anodal stimulation of left and cathodal stimulation of right DLPFC improves autism symptom severity as well as social cognition and emotion regulation in ASD. LAY SUMMARY: Previous research has suggested that targeting core mechanisms underlying cognitive-emotional and behavioral deficits of autistic children might improve symptoms of ASD. Deficient social and behavioral functioning, impaired theory of mind, and emotional regulation deficits have been identified as core treatment targets for this group. Specific subregions of the prefrontal cortex are involved in these deficits, including hypoactivity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Upregulation of this area with non-invasive brain stimulation, namely anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), results in improved social and behavioral functioning in children with ASD. Very few studies have however examined the effects of this intervention on theory of mind, emotional regulation, and emotional-behavioral problems. We examined the effects of anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC (F3), combined with cathodal tDCS over the right DLPFC (F4) on autism symptom severity as well as theory of mind, emotional regulation, and emotional-behavioral problems of children with ASD. This intervention improved autism symptom severity, specific domains of theory of mind, and emotion regulation. These findings have clinical implications for the treatment of ASD and suggest that targeting core mechanisms underlying socio-cognitive-emotional deficits of autistic children using tDCS might improve symptoms of ASD.","Zemestani Mehdi, Hoseinpanahi Omid, Salehinejad Mohammad Ali, Nitsche Michael A",Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research,"Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Child, Emotional Regulation, Humans, Prefrontal Cortex, Theory of Mind, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36069668,"Department of Psychology, University of Kurdistan, Sanandaj, Iran.; Department of Psychology and Neurosciences, Leibniz Research Centre for Working Environment and Human Factors, Dortmund, Germany."

Randomized, double-blind, parallel, sham-controlled clinical trial (tDCS for the Treatment of Inattention Symptoms in Adult Patients With ADHD [TUNED]), conducted from July 2019 through July 2021 in a single-center outpatient academic setting. Of 277 potential participants screened by phone, 150 were assessed for eligibility on site, and 64 were included. Participants were adults with ADHD, inattentive or combined subtype. Exclusion criteria included current stimulant drug treatment, current moderate to severe symptoms of depression or anxiety, diagnosis of bipolar disorder with a manic or depressive episode in the last year, diagnosis of schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder, and diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder; 55 of participants completed follow-up after 4 weeks. Thirty-minute daily sessions of home-based tDCS for 4 weeks, 2 mA anodal-right and cathodal-left prefrontal stimulation with 35-cm2 carbon electrodes. Inattentive scores in the clinician-administered version of the Adult ADHD Self-report Scale version 1.1 (CASRS-I). Included in this trial were 64 participants with ADHD (31 [48%] inattentive presentation and 33 [52%] combined presentation), with a mean (SD) age of 38.3 (9.6) years. Thirty participants (47%) were women and 34 (53%) were men. Fifty-five finished the trial. At week 4, the mean (SD) inattention score, as measured with CASRS-I, was 18.88 (5.79) in the active tDCS group and 23.63 (3.97) in the sham tDCS group. Linear mixed-effects models revealed a statistically significant treatment by time interaction for CASRS-I (βinteraction = -3.18; 95% CI, -4.60 to -1.75; P < .001), showing decreased symptoms of inattention in the active tDCS group over the 3 assessments compared to the sham tDCS group. Mild adverse events were more frequent in the active tDCS group, particularly skin redness, headache, and scalp burn. In this randomized clinical trial, daily treatment with a home-based tDCS device over 4 weeks improved attention in adult patients with ADHD who were not taking stimulant medication.

In this pilot study, we aim to explore whether anodal multichannel tDCS coupled with a Joint Attention Task (JAT) influences social-cognitive task performance relative to sham stimulation, both in an Emotion Recognition Task (ERT) and in a Mooney Faces Detection Task (MFDT), as well as to evaluate this technique's safety and tolerability. Twenty healthy adults were enrolled in a randomized, single-blinded, sham-controlled, crossover study. During two sessions, participants completed the ERT and the MFDT before and after 20min of sham or anodal tDCS over bilateral TPJ. No significant differences on performance accuracy and reaction time were found between stimulation conditions for all tasks, including the JAT. A significant main time effect for overall accuracy and reaction time was found for the MFDT. Itching was the most common side effect and stimulation conditions detection was at chance level. Results suggest that multichannel tDCS over bilateral TPJ does not affect performance of low-level emotional recognition tasks in healthy adults.

34018333,10.1002/Aur.2538,"Contribution of the right temporoparietal junction and ventromedial prefrontal cortex to theory of mind in autism: A randomized, sham-controlled tDCS study.",2021-08-01,"Theory of mind (ToM) is the ability to attribute subjective mental states to oneself and others and is significantly impaired in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A frontal-posterior network of regions including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is involved in ToM. Previous studies show an underactivation of these regions in ASD. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation method for causally investigating brain-behavior relationships via induction of cortical excitability alterations. tDCS, mostly over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, has been increasingly applied for improving behavioral problems in ASD leaving other potentially interesting regions untouched. Here we investigated contribution of the vmPFC and right TPJ in ToM abilities of ASD children via tDCS in a pilot study. Sixteen children with ASD (mean age = 10.7 ± 1.9) underwent three tDCS sessions (1 mA, 20 min) in a randomized, sham-controlled design. Stimulation protocols included: (a) anodal vmPFC tDCS, (b) anodal r-TPJ tDCS, and (c) sham tDCS. ToM abilities were explored during tDCS using the theory of mind test (TOMT). Our results show that activation of the vmPFC with anodal tDCS significantly improved ToM in children with ASD compared with both, r-TPJ tDCS, and sham stimulation. Specifically, precursors of ToM (e.g., emotion recognition, perception, and imitation) and elementary ToM skills (e.g., first-order mental state reasoning) were significantly improved by anodal vmPFC tDCS. Based on these results, the vmPFC could be a potential target region for the reduction of ASD symptoms via noninvasive brain stimulation, which should be examined in larger detail in future studies. LAY SUMMARY: Theory of mind (ToM) is the ability to infer mental states of oneself and others, which is impaired in autism. Brain imaging studies have shown involvement of two brain regions in ToM (ventromedial prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal junction) which are underactivated in autism. We increased activation of these regions via noninvasive brain stimulation in this experiment to see how it would affect ToM abilities in autism.

To date, there is no effective medication that can improve social communication and interaction in ASD, and effect sizes of behaviour-based psychotherapy remain in the low to medium range. Consequently, there is a clear need for new treatment options. ASD is associated with altered activation and connectivity patterns in brain areas which process social information. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a technique that applies a weak electrical current to the brain in order to modulate neural excitability and alter connectivity. Combined with specific cognitive tasks, it allows to facilitate and consolidate the respective training effects. Therefore, application of tDCS in brain areas relevant to social cognition in combination with a specific cognitive training is a promising treatment approach for ASD. A phase-IIa pilot randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, parallel-group clinical study is presented, which aims at investigating if 10 days of 20-min multi-channel tDCS stimulation of the bilateral tempo-parietal junction (TPJ) at 2.0 mA in combination with a computer-based cognitive training on perspective taking, intention and emotion understanding, can improve social cognitive abilities in children and adolescents with ASD. The main objectives are to describe the change in parent-rated social responsiveness from baseline (within 1 week before first stimulation) to post-intervention (within 7 days after last stimulation) and to monitor safety and tolerability of the intervention. Secondary objectives include the evaluation of change in parent-rated social responsiveness at follow-up (4 weeks after end of intervention), change in other ASD core symptoms and psychopathology, social cognitive abilities and neural functioning post-intervention and at follow-up in order to explore underlying neural and cognitive mechanisms. If shown, positive results regarding change in parent-rated social cognition and favourable safety and tolerability of the intervention will confirm tDCS as a promising treatment for ASD core-symptoms.

Such dysfunctions are associated with anxiety, depression, and a lack of autonomy. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to enhance EF in healthy adults and clinical populations and to improve working memory - a component of the EF - in adults with high-functioning ASD (HF-ASD). We hypothesized that tDCS could improve the EF of HF-ASD patients. Such enhancement could improve their adaptive behaviors. Eight patients with HF-ASD received 10 consecutive cathodal tDCS sessions (2 mA) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (F3) for 15 min each in an open trial. EF (with the Stroop test, Trail Making Test [TMT] A and B, Modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test [mWCST], and Verbal Fluency Test) and behavioral dysexecutive syndrome (with the Behavioral Dysexecutive Syndrome Inventory and the Repetitive and Restricted Behaviour scale) were assessed before and 10 days after treatment. This study showed significant improvement in initiation (TMT-A time: p = 0.018) and cognitive flexibility (TMT-B time: p = 0.009; letter Verbal Fluency Test: p = 0.017; mWCST total errors: p = 0.028) after tDCS. Regarding behavior, the hypoactivity of the patients improved, as well as their repetitive and restrictive behaviors. In addition, this noninvasive neurostimulation technique was well tolerated. Flexibility and initiation are the most impaired EF in autism. These are promising results which justify a randomized and placebo-controlled study in a wider population. If these results were confirmed by a randomized controlled trial, tDCS could be an easy and well-tolerated adjunctive treatment aiming to improve the quality of life and the autonomy of ASD patients.","Rothärmel Maud, Moulier Virginie, Vasse Marianne, Isaac Clémence, Faerber Mathieu, Bendib Bilal, Mirea-Grivel Iris, Opolczynski Gaëlle, Rosier Antoine, Guillin Olivier",Neuropsychobiology,"Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Executive Function, Female, Humans, Male, Neuropsychological Tests, Pilot Projects, Prefrontal Cortex, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31266030,"University Department of Psychiatry, Centre Hospitalier du Rouvray, Sotteville-lès-Rouen, France.; Centre Ressource Autisme Normandie Seine Eure, Centre Hospitalier du Rouvray, Sotteville-lès-Rouen, France.; University Department of Psychiatry, Centre Hospitalier du Rouvray, Sotteville-lès-Rouen, France, maud.rotharmel@ch-lerouvray.fr.; EPS Ville Evrard, Unité de Recherche Clinique, Neuilly-sur-Marne, France."

Current treatments are extremely time- and labor-intensive. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may be a promising treatment modality to safely enhance treatments targeting social cognition and social skills. This pilot study investigates the effectiveness of social skills treatment interventions paired with anodal tDCS for six adults 18-58 years with ASD. Differences were predicted on the verbal fluency (VF) test and a test of social skills (TASSK-M) for verum (2.0 mA) vs. sham tDCS, which was randomly assigned in a within-subjects, double-blinded design in adults with ASD with normal or higher cognitive functioning. The anode electrode was placed over right temporoparietal (CP6) and cathode over ipsilateral deltoid. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for paired data indicated that participants received a significantly higher score on the VF test after receiving verum tDCS compared to sham tDCS, with no significant differences found on the TASSK-M. Post-hoc analysis showed that the emotion-word portion of the VF test, specifically, indicated significant differences when comparing verum to sham tDCS conditions. These findings provide optimism for the use of tDCS as delivered in the current study paired with social skills treatment interventions for ASD, particularly for improving skills of emotion verbal fluency.","Esse Wilson Joan, Trumbo Michael C, Wilson J Kevin, Tesche Claudia D","Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)","Adolescent, Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Parietal Lobe, Pilot Projects, Social Perception, Social Skills, Temporal Lobe, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30341695,"Department of Linguistics, University of New Mexico, MSC03 2130 1 University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, 87131, USA.; Cognitive Science and Applications, Sandia National Laboratory, 1611 Innovation Pkwy SE, Albuquerque, NM, 87123, USA.; Department of Psychology, University of New Mexico, MSC03 2220 1 University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, 87131, USA.; Department of Psychology, University of New Mexico, MSC03 2220 1 University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, 87131, USA. ctesche@unm.edu."
28775825,10.1186/S13229-017-0152-X,Balanced bifrontal transcranial direct current stimulation enhances working memory in adults with high-functioning autism: a sham-controlled crossover study.,2017-01-01,"Working memory (WM) often is impaired in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Such impairment may underlie core deficits in cognition and social functioning. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to enhance WM in both healthy adults and clinical populations, but its efficacy in ASD is unknown. We predicted that bifrontal tDCS would improve WM performances of adults with high-functioning autism during active stimulation compared to sham stimulation and that such enhancement would generalize to an untrained task. Twelve adults with high-functioning ASD engaged in a battery of WM tasks that included backward spatial span, backward digit span, spatial <i>n</i>-back and letter <i>n</i>-back. While engaged, 40 min of 1.5 mA bifrontal stimulation was applied over the left and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC). Using a single-blind crossover design, each participant received left anodal/right cathodal stimulation, right anodal/left cathodal stimulation, or sham stimulation, in randomized counterbalanced order on three separate days. Following tDCS, participants again engaged in letter and spatial <i>n</i>-back tasks before taking the Brief Test of Attention (BTA). We used repeated-measures ANOVA to compare overall performance on the WM battery as measured by a composite of <i>z</i>-scores for all five measures. Post hoc ANOVAs, <i>t</i> tests, Friedman's tests, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to measure the online and offline effects of tDCS and to assess performances on individual measures. Compared to sham stimulation, both left DLPFC anodal stimulation (<i>t</i><sub>11</sub> = 5.4, <i>p</i> = 0.0002) and right DLPFC anodal stimulation (<i>t</i><sub>11</sub> = 3.57, <i>p</i> = 0.004) improved overall WM performance. Left anodal stimulation (<i>t</i><sub>11</sub> = 3.9, <i>p</i> = 0.003) and right anodal stimulation (<i>t</i><sub>11</sub> = 2.7, <i>p</i> = 0.019) enhanced performances during stimulation. Enhancement transferred to an untrained task 50 min after right anodal stimulation <i>(z</i><sub>11</sub> = 2.263, <i>p</i> = 0.024). The tasks that showed the largest effects of active stimulation were spatial span backward (<i>z</i><sub>11</sub> = 2.39, <i>p</i> = 0.017) and BTA (<i>z</i><sub>11</sub> = 2.263, <i>p</i> = 0.024). In adults with high-functioning ASD, active bifrontal tDCS given during WM tasks appears to improve performance. TDCS benefits also transferred to an untrained task completed shortly after stimulation. These results suggest that tDCS can improve WM task performance and could reduce some core deficits of autism.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of transcranial pulse stimulation on the right temporoparietal junction, which is a key node for social cognition for autism spectrum disorder, and to examine the association between transcranial pulse stimulation and executive and social functions. This double-blinded, randomized, sham-controlled trial included 32 participants (27 males), aged 12-17 years with autism spectrum disorder. All eligible participants were randomized into either the verum or sham transcranial pulse stimulation group, on a 1:1 ratio, based on the Childhood Autism Rating Scale screening score. Sixteen participants received six verum transcranial pulse stimulation sessions (energy level: 0.2-0.25 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>; pulse frequency: 2.5-4.0 Hz, 800 pulse/session) in 2 weeks on alternate days. The remaining 16 participants received sham transcranial pulse stimulation. The primary outcome measure included Childhood Autism Rating Scale score changes, evaluated by parents, from baseline to 3-month follow-ups. Secondary outcomes included a self-reported questionnaire responded to by parents and cognitive tests responded to by participants. A licensed mental health professional evaluated clinical global impression severity, improvement, efficacy and total score. Results revealed significant interactions in Childhood Autism Rating Scale and other secondary outcomes. Significant group and time effects were found in most secondary outcomes. Additionally, significant differences were found between the transcranial pulse stimulation and sham transcranial pulse stimulation groups in Childhood Autism Rating Scale and clinical global impression improvement and total score immediately after 2 weeks of transcranial pulse stimulation intervention (all <i>P</i> < 0.05), and effects were sustainable at 1- and 3-month follow-up, compared with baseline. The effect size of Childhood Autism Rating Scale (<i>d</i> = 0.83-0.95) and clinical global impression improvement (<i>d</i> = 4.12-4.37) were large to medium immediately after intervention and sustained at 1-month post-stimulation; however, the effects were reduced to small at 3-month post-stimulation (<i>d</i> = 2.31). These findings indicated that transcranial pulse stimulation over right temporoparietal junction was effective to reduce the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, as evidenced by a 24% reduction in the total Childhood Autism Rating Scale score in the verum transcranial pulse stimulation group. Additionally, the clinical global impression total score was reduced by 53.7% in the verum transcranial pulse stimulation group at a 3-month follow-up, compared with the baseline.

Following a series of communications from readers highlighting concerns about the paper (now published on the journal website), the journal editors requested that the authors send them the raw data from the trial. In response the authors informed the editors that; (i) the electronic data base had been lost following a computer outage and (ii) that they could send only 95 out of 120 hard-copy participant data sheets as one site had closed and was no longer contactable. The substantial data loss in and of itself posed a serious difficulty in verifying the correctness of the data presented in the paper. The JCPP then analysed the data from the 95 cases itself. A number of significant discrepancies emerged between the re-analysis and the findings reported in the paper both in terms of means and standard deviations of key outcome variables across the trial. These involved very substantial differences that we judged to be extremely unlikely to have arisen due to variations in composition of the original and re-analysed samples. We also discovered previously unidentified/reported problems with missing data and recording irregularities regarding changes in treatment regimen and subject identifiers.

Secondary exploratory outcomes included additional subscales from the ABC, the Social Responsiveness Scale and rating on the Developmental Disabilities-Children's Global Assessment Scale (DD-CGAS) as well as biochemical parameters of total vitamin D status (25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D)), immunity and systemic inflammation. 38 children completed the trial. Baseline 25(OH)D was 54.2±19.7 nmol/L. Following vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation, there was a significant increase in 25(OH)D to 83.8 nmol/L (p=0.0016) but no effect on the primary endpoint. However, there was an improvement in self-care on DD-CGAS (p=0.02). In contrast, there was also a trend toward decreased inappropriate speech in the placebo group (p=0.08). Vitamin D supplementation had no effect on the primary outcome with limited and inconsistent effects in children with ASD. Considering the other promising data as well as the relative safety and cheapness of vitamin D supplementation, further trials are warranted.

Vitamin D is metabolized into a seco-steroid hormone that regulates about 3% of the 26,000 genes in the coding human genome. It is also a neurosteroid that is active in brain development, having effects on cellular proliferation, differentiation, calcium signaling, neurotrophic and neuroprotective actions; it also appears to have an effect on neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. Children who are, or who are destined to become, autistic have lower 25(OH)D levels at 3 months of gestation, at birth and at age 8 compared to their unaffected siblings. Two open label trials found high dose vitamin D improves the core symptoms of autism in about 75% of autistic children. A few of the improvements were remarkable. The vitamin D doses used in these children were 300 IU/KG/day up to a maximum of 5000 IU/day (highest final 25(OH)D level reached was 45 ng/ml). The other study used 150,000 IU/month IM as well as 400 IU/day [highest final 25(OH)D level was 52 ng/ml]. These two open label trials were recently confirmed with a randomized controlled trial (RCT) using 300 IU/kg/day with a maximum of 5000 IU/day and resulted in effects similar to the two open label studies. In terms of prevention, a recent small study showed vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy (5000 IU/day) and during infancy and early childhood (1000 IU/day) significantly reduced the expected incidence of autism in mothers who already had one autistic child from 20% to 5%. Vitamin D is safe; for example, over the last 15 years, Poison Control reports there have been approximately 15,000 cases of vitamin D overdose. However only three of these 15,000 people developed clinical toxicity and no one died. Given those facts, practitioners might consider treating autism with 300 IU/kg/day, and seek to prevent autism by supplementing pregnant and lactating women (5000 IU/day) and infants and young children (150 IU/kg/day) checking 25(OH)D levels every 3 months. These doses will increase 25(OH)D blood levels to those recommended by the Endocrine Society. As the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends vitamin D supplementation during infancy and childhood, pediatricians and family practitioners should evaluate the current evidence on autism and vitamin D and act accordingly.",Cannell John Jacob,Reviews in endocrine & metabolic disorders,"Adult, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Dietary Supplements, Female, Humans, Infant, Infant, Newborn, Pregnancy, Pregnancy Complications, Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects, Vitamin D, Vitamin D Deficiency",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28217829,"Vitamin D Council Inc., 1411 Marsh Street, Suite 203, San Luis Obispo, CA, 93401, USA. jjcannell@vitamindcouncil.org."
27868194,10.1111/Jcpp.12652,Randomized controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation in children with autism spectrum disorder.,2018-01-01,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a frequent developmental disorder characterized by pervasive deficits in social interaction, impairment in verbal and nonverbal communication, and stereotyped patterns of interests and activities. It has been previously reported that there is vitamin D deficiency in autistic children; however, there is a lack of randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation in ASD children. This study is a double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (RCT) that was conducted on 109 children with ASD (85 boys and 24 girls; aged 3-10 years). The aim of this study was to assess the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the core symptoms of autism in children. ASD patients were randomized to receive vitamin D3 or placebo for 4 months. The serum levels of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25 (OH)D) were measured at the beginning and at the end of the study. The autism severity and social maturity of the children were assessed by the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), and the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC). UMIN-CTR Study Design: trial number: UMIN000020281. Supplementation of vitamin D was well tolerated by the ASD children. The daily doses used in the therapy group was 300 IU vitamin D3/kg/day, not to exceed 5,000 IU/day. The autism symptoms of the children improved significantly, following 4-month vitamin D3 supplementation, but not in the placebo group. This study demonstrates the efficacy and tolerability of high doses of vitamin D3 in children with ASD. This study is the first double-blinded RCT proving the efficacy of vitamin D3 in ASD patients. Depending on the parameters measured in the study, oral vitamin D supplementation may safely improve signs and symptoms of ASD and could be recommended for children with ASD. At this stage, this study is a single RCT with a small number of patients, and a great deal of additional wide-scale studies are needed to critically validate the efficacy of vitamin D in ASD.","Saad Khaled, Abdel-Rahman Ahmed A, Elserogy Yasser M, Al-Atram Abdulrahman A, El-Houfey Amira A, Othman Hisham A-K, Bjørklund Geir, Jia Feiyong, Urbina Mauricio A, Abo-Elela Mohamed Gamil M, Ahmad Faisal-Alkhateeb, Abd El-Baseer Khaled A, Ahmed Ahmed E, Abdel-Salam Ahmad M","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Dietary Supplements, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Vitamin D",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27868194,"Department of Clinical Pathology, Aswan University, Aswan, Egypt.; Department of Community Health Nursing, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.; Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.; Department of Psychiatry, College of Medicine, Almajmaah University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.; Council for Nutritional and Environmental Medicine, Mo i Rana, Norway.; Department of Pediatrics, Qena Faculty of Medicine, South Valley University, Qena, Egypt.; Department of Pediatric Neurology and Neurorehabilitation, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.; Department of Neuropsychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.; Department of Biosciences, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK.; Department of Pharmaceutics and Industrial Pharmacy, Alazhar University, Assiut, Egypt."

Preclinical research suggests that arginine vasopressin (AVP), a neuropeptide involved in promoting mammalian social behaviors, may be a possible treatment for ASD. Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel study design, we tested the efficacy and tolerability of a 4-week intranasal AVP daily treatment in 30 children with ASD. AVP-treated participants aged 6 to 9.5 years received the maximum daily target dose of 24 International Units (IU); participants aged 9.6 to 12.9 years received the maximum daily target dose of 32 IU.

AVP treatment also diminished anxiety symptoms and some repetitive behaviors. Most of these findings were more pronounced when we accounted for pretreatment AVP concentrations in blood. AVP was well tolerated with minimal side effects. No AVP-treated participants dropped out of the trial, and there were no differences in the rate of adverse events reported between treatment conditions. Last, no changes from baseline were observed in vital signs, electrocardiogram tracings, height and body weight, or clinical chemistry measurements after 4 weeks of AVP treatment.

No effective pharmacotherapy for these core deficits exists. Within the domain of social communication, the vasopressin system is implicated in social cognition and social signaling deficits of ASD, and represents a potential therapeutic target. We assessed the effects of a single 20 mg intravenous dose of the arginine vasopressin receptor 1A (V1a) antagonist, RG7713, on exploratory biomarkers (eye tracking), behavioral and clinical measures of social cognition and communication (affective speech recognition (ASR), reading the mind in the eyes, olfactory identification, scripted interaction), and safety and tolerability in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of 19 high-functioning adult male subjects with DSM-IV Autistic Disorder (age 18-45 years; full scale IQ >70; ABC-Irritability subscale ⩽13). Eye-tracking showed an increase in biological motion orienting preference with RG7713 (ES=0.8, p=0.047) and a non-significant improvement in the composite score (ES=0.2, p=0.29). RG7713 reduced ability to detect lust (ES=-0.8, p=0.03) and fear (ES=-0.7, p=0.07) in ASR. However, when all eight individual emotion subscales were combined into an overall ASR performance score, the reduction was non-significant (ES=-0.1, p=0.59). Thirteen adverse events were reported in 10 subjects; all were of mild (11/13) or moderate (2/13) severity. Although interpretation should be cautious due to multiple comparisons and small sample size, these results provide preliminary evidence from experimental and behavioral biomarkers, that blockade of the V1a receptor may improve social communication in adults with high-functioning ASD.

Clinical features are moderate to severe intellectual disability and behavioural problems in the autism spectrum. Other researchers had observed a beneficial effect of intranasal insulin on development and behaviour in a pilot study in six children with PMS. To validate this effect, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial using a stepped-wedge design. From March 2013 to June 2015, 25 children aged 1-16 years with a molecularly confirmed 22q13.3 deletion including the SHANK3 gene participated in the clinical trial for a period of 18 months. Starting 6 months before the trial, children were systematically assessed for cognitive, language and motor development and for adaptive, social and emotional behaviour every 6 months. The second, third and fourth assessments were followed by daily nose sprays containing either intranasal insulin or intranasal placebo for a 6-month period. A fifth assessment was done directly after the end of the trial. Intranasal insulin did not cause serious adverse events. It increased the level of developmental functioning by 0.4-1.4 months per 6-month period, but the effect was not statistically significant in this small group. We found a stronger effect of intranasal insulin, being significant for cognition and social skills, for children older than 3 years, who usually show a decrease of developmental growth. However, clinical trials in larger study populations are required to prove the therapeutic effect of intranasal insulin in PMS.","Zwanenburg Renée J, Bocca Gianni, Ruiter Selma A J, Dillingh Jan H, Flapper Boudien C T, van den Heuvel Edwin R, van Ravenswaaij-Arts Conny M A",European journal of human genetics : EJHG,"Administration, Intranasal, Adolescent, Child, Child Development, Child, Preschool, Chromosome Deletion, Chromosome Disorders, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Infant, Insulin, Male, Nerve Tissue Proteins, Social Skills",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27577546,"Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands.; University of Groningen, University Medical Centre Groningen, Beatrix Children's Hospital, Department of Paediatrics, Groningen, The Netherlands.; University of Groningen, University Medical Centre Groningen, Department of Genetics, Groningen, The Netherlands.; De Kinderacademie Groningen, Centre of Expertise for Child Development Care and Research, Groningen, The Netherlands.; University of Groningen, University Medical Centre Groningen, Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology, Groningen, The Netherlands."

Human promoter-region microsatellite repeat regions (RS1 and RS3) in the AVPR1a gene region have been associated with autism spectrum disorders, prosocial behavior and social cognition. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle response to auditory stimuli is a largely autonomic response that resonates with social cognition in both animal models and humans. Reduced PPI has been observed in disorders including schizophrenia that are distinguished by deficits in social skills. In the current investigation association was examined between PPI and the AVPR1a RS1 and RS repeat regions and PPI in a group of 113 nonclinical subjects. Using a robust family-based strategy, association was observed between AVPR1a promoter-region repeat length, especially RS3) and PPI (30 ms: global p=0.04; 60 ms p=0.006; 120 ms p=0.008). Notably, longer RS3 alleles were associated with greater levels of prepulse inhibition. Using a short/long classification scheme for the repeat regions, significant association was also observed between all three PPI intervals (30, 60 and 120 ms) and both RS1 and RS3 polymorphisms (PBAT: FBAT-PC(2) statistic p=0.047). Tests of within-subject effects (SPSS GLM) showed significant sexxRS3 interactions at 30 ms (p=0.045) and 60 ms (p=0.01). Longer alleles, especially in male subjects, are associated with significantly higher PPI response, consistent with a role for the promoter repeat region in partially molding social behavior in both animals and humans. This is the first report in humans demonstrating a role of the AVPR1a gene in contributing to the PPI response to auditory stimuli.","Levin Raz, Heresco-Levy Uriel, Bachner-Melman Rachel, Israel Salomon, Shalev Idan, Ebstein Richard P",Psychoneuroendocrinology,"Acoustic Stimulation, Adolescent, Adult, Female, Gene Frequency, Habituation, Psychophysiologic, Humans, Male, Neural Inhibition, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Promoter Regions, Genetic, Receptors, Vasopressin, Reflex, Startle, Sex Characteristics, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19195791,"Neurobiology, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel."
