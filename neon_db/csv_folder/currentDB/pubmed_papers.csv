Twenty-four children with autism, 3.0 to 8.3 years old (mean 5.1) who were living at home and attending appropriate school programs, participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Naltrexone, 1.0 mg/kg, or placebo was administered daily for 2 weeks. Communication was evaluated from videotaped samples of seminaturalistic parent-child interaction. Child and parent language were assessed using similar measures. In this heterogeneous sample, the median number of words the child produced on placebo was 9.5 (range 0-124). The median proportion of utterances with echolalia was 0.16. No differences were found between the naltrexone and placebo conditions in any of the measures of children or parents' communication. Significant correlations were found between the child's number of words and developmental quotient (Spearman rho = 0.58, p = .003) and between the child's and parent's number of words (rho = 0.55, p = .005). Previous studies showed that naltrexone was associated with modest reduction in hyperactivity and restlessness in this group of children with autism. In this short-term study, the medication did not lead to improvement in communication, a core deficit of autism.","Feldman H M, Kolmen B K, Gonzaga A M","Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry","Autistic Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Language, Male, Motor Activity, Naltrexone, Narcotic Antagonists, Parent-Child Relations, Treatment Outcome, Verbal Behavior","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10230191","Department of Pediatrics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA.",

After recent publicity about a child with autism whose condition markedly improved after a single dose of secretin, thousands of children with autistic disorders may have received secretin injections. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a single intravenous dose of synthetic human secretin in 60 children (age, 3 to 14 years) with autism or pervasive developmental disorder. The children were randomly assigned to treatment with an intravenous infusion of synthetic human secretin (0.4 microg per kilogram of body weight) or saline placebo. We used standardized behavioral measures of the primary and secondary features of autism, including the Autism Behavior Checklist, to assess the degree of impairment at base line and over the course of a four-week period after treatment. Of the 60 children, 4 could not be evaluated - 2 received secretin outside the study, and 2 did not return for follow-up. Thus, 56 children (28 in each group) completed the study. As compared with placebo, secretin treatment was not associated with significant improvements in any of the outcome measures. Among the children in the secretin group, the mean total score on the Autism Behavior Checklist at base line was 59.0 (range of possible values, 0 to 158, with a larger value corresponding to greater impairment), and among those in the placebo group it was 63.2. The mean decreases in scores over the four-week period were 8.9 in the secretin group and 17.8 in the placebo group (mean difference, -8.9; 95 percent confidence interval, -19.4 to 1.6; P=0.11). None of the children had treatment-limiting adverse effects.

We undertook a two-part clinical trial to investigate these claims. Fifty-six patients (49 boys, 7 girls, mean age = 6.4 years, SD = 2.7) enrolled in an open-label trial of secretin, during which they received one injection of the hormone (2 IU/kg).

Thirty-four patients were labeled with Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, and 22 met diagnostic criteria for Autistic Disorder. Forty-five patients were concurrently on other drug treatments. At follow-up, some reported minimal but potentially significant improvements including changes in GI symptoms, expressive and/or receptive language function, and improved awareness and social interactions. No adverse effects were reported or observed. Subsequently, 17 of the most responsive patients from Study 1 began a double-blind trial that also included 8 newly enrolled patients. Patients in this second study were alternatively entered into one of two groups and received injections of secretin or placebo with crossover at 4 weeks. Patients from Study 1 entered into Study 2 at an average of 6.5 (SD = 0.8) weeks after beginning Study 1.

Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology.","2000-04-01","Assessment of autistic disorder (autism) symptoms, primary and secondary, poses more challenging problems than ordinarily found in multisite randomized clinical trial (RCT) assessments. For example, subjects may be uncommunicative and extremely heterogeneous in problem presentation, and current pharmacological treatments are not likely to alter most core features of autism. The Autism Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology (RUPP Autism Network) resolved some of these problems during the design of a risperidone RCT in children/adolescents. The inappropriateness of the usual anchors for a Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) was resolved by defining uncomplicated autism without secondary symptoms as a CGI-S of 3, mildly ill. The communication problems, compromising use of the patient as an informant, were addressed by several strategies, including careful questioning of care providers, rating scales, laboratory tests, and physical exams. The broad subject heterogeneity requires outcome measures sensitive to individual change over a wide spectrum of treatment response and side effects. The problems of neuropsychologically testing nonverbal, lower functioning, sometimes noncompliant subjects requires careful instrument selection/adaptation and flexible administration techniques. The problems of assessing low-end IQs, neglected by most standardized test developers, was resolved by an algorithm of test hierarchy. Scarcity of other autism-adapted cognitive and neuropsychological tests and lack of standardization required development of a new, specially adapted battery. Reliability on the Autism Diagnostic Interview (currently the most valid diagnostic instrument) and other clinician instruments required extensive cross-site training (in-person, videotape, and teleconference sessions). Definition of a treatment responder required focus on individually relevant target symptoms, synthesis of possible modest improvements in many domains, and acceptance of attainable though imperfect goals. The assessment strategy developed is implemented in a RCT of risperidone (McDougle et al., 2000) for which the design and other methodological challenges are described elsewhere (Scahill et al., 2000). Some of these problems and solutions are partially shared with RCTs of other treatments and other disorders.","Arnold L E, Aman M G, Martin A, Collier-Crespin A, Vitiello B, Tierney E, Asarnow R, Bell-Bradshaw F, Freeman B J, Gates-Ulanet P, Klin A, McCracken J T, McDougle C J, McGough J J, Posey D J, Scahill L, Swiezy N B, Ritz L, Volkmar F","Journal of autism and developmental disorders","Antipsychotic Agents, Autistic Disorder, Child, Humans, Neuropsychological Tests, Reproducibility of Results, Risperidone, Treatment Outcome","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10832774","Arnold.6@osu.edu",

Previous studies have suggested a relation between serotonergic function and clinical outcome in serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. In a randomized, double-blind trial, comparing clomipramine, paroxetine, and a placebo in obsessive-compulsive disorder, serotonin levels in whole blood (WB-5-HT) were measured at baseline, after 1 week, and after 4 weeks of treatment and related to clinical outcome in 36 patients. In patients treated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors there was a pronounced decrease of WB-5-HT, variable after 1 week and uniformly maximal after 4 weeks. The decrease of WB-5-HT after 1 week of serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment correlated negatively with clinical outcome after 12 weeks (r = -.61, p =.0006); hence, patients with slower WB-5-HT reactivity eventually responded better to treatment. Baseline WB-5-HT, but not WB-5-HT reactivity, was related to season. Depression, autistic traits, and previous serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment predicted nonresponse. A fast decrease of WB-5-HT was associated with poor clinical outcome. This may be related to faster serotonin efflux from platelets, which has previously been linked to autism. Further studies are necessary to identify the underlying mechanism and discern whether serotonin reuptake inhibitor-induced WB-5-HT decrease is clinically useful.","Humble M, Bejerot S, Bergqvist P B, Bengtsson F","Biological psychiatry","Adult, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Paroxetine, Serotonin, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11239907","Psychiatry of Northern Dalecarlia, Mora Hospital, Mora, Sweden.",

When assessed on the basis of parent-rated ABC-CV ratings of irritability and hyperactivity, the mean placebo response rate was 37% versus amantadine at 47% (not significant). However, in the amantadine-treated group there were statistically significant improvements in absolute changes in clinician-rated ABC-CVs for hyperactivity (amantadine -6.4 versus placebo -2.1; p = .046) and inappropriate speech (-1.9 versus 0.4; p = .008). CGI scale ratings were higher in the amantadine group: 53% improved versus 25% (p = .076). Amantadine was well tolerated. Parents did not report statistically significant behavioral change with amantadine. However, clinician-rated improvements in behavioral ratings following treatment with amantadine suggest that further studies with this or other drugs acting on the glutamatergic system are warranted. The design of these and similar drug trials in children with autistic disorder must take into account the possibility of a large placebo response.","King B H, Wright D M, Handen B L, Sikich L, Zimmerman A W, McMahon W, Cantwell E, Davanzo P A, Dourish C T, Dykens E M, Hooper S R, Jaselskis C A, Leventhal B L, Levitt J, Lord C, Lubetsky M J, Myers S M, Ozonoff S, Shah B G, Snape M, Shernoff E W, Williamson K, Cook E H","Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry","Adolescent, Adult, Amantadine, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Dopamine Agents, Double-Blind Method, Drug Administration Schedule, Female, Humans, Irritable Mood, Male, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Psychomotor Agitation, Severity of Illness Index, Treatment Outcome","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11392343","Department of Psychiatry, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH 03756-0001, USA.

Other abnormalities include seizures, electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities, affective instability, impulsivity, and aggression. Divalproex sodium is indicated as both an anticonvulsant in epilepsy and a mood stabilizer in bipolar illness and thus might be useful for these complicating symptoms in autism. A retrospective pilot study was conducted to determine whether divalproex sodium was effective in treating core dimensions and associated features of autism. Fourteen patients who met DSM-IV criteria for autism, Asperger's disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, both with and without a history of seizure disorders or EEG abnormalities, were openly treated with divalproex sodium. Improvement was assessed via the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale. Of 14 patients who completed a trial of divalproex sodium, 10 (71%) were rated as having sustained response to treatment. The mean dose of divalproex sodium was 768 mg/day (range, 125-2500 mg/day), and it was generally well tolerated. Improvement was noted in core symptoms of autism and associated features of affective instability, impulsivity, and aggression. Divalproex sodium may be beneficial to patients with autism spectrum disorders, particularly those with associated features of affective instability, impulsivity, and aggression as well as those with a history of EEG abnormalities or seizures. Of note, all patients with an abnormal EEG and/or seizure history were rated as responders. However, these findings must be interpreted with caution, given the open retrospective nature of the study.

Treatment with risperidone for eight weeks (dose range, 0.5 to 3.5 mg per day) resulted in a 56.9 percent reduction in the Irritability score, as compared with a 14.1 percent decrease in the placebo group (P<0.001). The rate of a positive response, defined as at least a 25 percent decrease in the Irritability score and a rating of much improved or very much improved on the CGI-I scale, was 69 percent in the risperidone group (34 of 49 children had a positive response) and 12 percent in the placebo group (6 of 52, P<0.001). Risperidone therapy was associated with an average weight gain of 2.7+/-2.9 kg, as compared with 0.8+/-2.2 kg with placebo (P<0.001). Increased appetite, fatigue, drowsiness, dizziness, and drooling were more common in the risperidone group than in the placebo group (P<0.05 for each comparison). In two thirds of the children with a positive response to risperidone at eight weeks (23 of 34), the benefit was maintained at six months. Risperidone was effective and well tolerated for the treatment of tantrums, aggression, or self-injurious behavior in children with autistic disorder. The short period of this trial limits inferences about adverse effects such as tardive dyskinesia.","McCracken James T, McGough James, Shah Bhavik, Cronin Pegeen, Hong Daniel, Aman Michael G, Arnold L Eugene, Lindsay Ronald, Nash Patricia, Hollway Jill, McDougle Christopher J, Posey David, Swiezy Naomi, Kohn Arlene, Scahill Lawrence, Martin Andres, Koenig Kathleen, Volkmar Fred, Carroll Deirdre, Lancor Allison, Tierney Elaine, Ghuman Jaswinder, Gonzalez Nilda M, Grados Marco, Vitiello Benedetto, Ritz Louise, Davies Mark, Robinson James, McMahon Don,  ","The New England journal of medicine","Adolescent, Antipsychotic Agents, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child Behavior, Child, Preschool, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Risperidone, Treatment Outcome","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12151468","University of California, Los Angeles, USA.",

Genetic variation of the serotonin receptor may influence the efficacy of fluvoxamine treatment. We studied the correlation between clinical responses to fluvoxamine and serotonin receptor gene polymorphism (5-HT2AR) in children with an autistic disorder. Eighteen patients completed a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover study. Clinical global impression (CGI) by child neurologists and interviews for parents were assessed after 12 weeks of fluvoxamine treatment. Behavioral assessments consisting of 20 items by newly created Behavioral Assessment Scale (BAS) were obtained before as well as 6 and 12 weeks after treatment. For genotyping of 5-HT2AR, 102 T/C polymorphism was analyzed by the PCR method. Seven cases of T/T, 6 of T/C and 5 of C/C were identified. The patients with the genotype T/C responded more favorably when estimated by CGI and parents' report at 12 weeks of treatment. Although not significant statistically (p = 0.0578), the number of improved BAS items in these patients were larger after fluvoxamine than placebo treatment. On analyses of individual BAS items, the patients with the genotype C/C showed improvement of unnatural facial expression, which was significant at 6 weeks, but not at 12 weeks, of fluvoxamine treatment. In the patients with the genotype T/C, eye movements and emotional changes were significantly improved at 12 weeks of treatment. Our results suggested that genetic polymorphism of 102 T/C in the 5-HT2AR gene may have influence on the response to fluvoxamine treatment for patients with an autistic disorder.

Although many researchers have noted the importance of joint attention deficits in the development of children with autism (e.g., Mundy, Sigman, & Kasari, 1994) and have called for intervention strategies (e.g., Mundy & Crowson, 1997), few studies have attempted to target joint attention. In this study, joint attention behaviors were taught to children with autism using a behavior modification procedure. A multiple-baseline design was implemented to evaluate intervention effects. The following target behaviors were included in the intervention: 1) Responding to showing, pointing, and gaze shifting of adult; 2) Coordinated gaze shifting (i.e., coordinated joint attention); and 3) Pointing (with the purpose of sharing, not requesting). Generalization to setting and parent, follow-up sessions, and social validation measures were also analyzed. Joint attention behaviors were effectively trained and targeted behaviors generalized to other settings. In addition, positive changes were noted by naive observers using social validation measures. Integrating joint attention training into existing interventions may be important for children with autism.

Eligible studies were comparative prospective or retrospective on healthy individuals up to 15 years of age, carried out or published by 2003. We identified 120 articles satisfying our inclusion criteria and included 22. MMR is associated with a lower incidence of upper respiratory tract infections, a higher incidence of irritability, similar incidence of other adverse effects compared to placebo and is likely to be associated with benign thrombocytopenic purpura (TP), parotitis, joint and limb complaints and aseptic meningitis (mumps Urabe strain-containing MMR).

The core symptoms of autism are abnormalities in social interaction, communication and behaviour. The involvement of neurotransmitters such as 5-HT has been suggested in neuropsychiatric disorders and particularly in autistic disorder. Increased platelet 5-HT levels were found in 40% of the autistic population, suggesting that hyperserotonaemia may be a pathologic factor in infantile autism. Therefore, it is of interest to assess the efficacy of cyproheptadine, a 5-HT2 antagonist in the treatment of autistic disorder. In this 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we assessed the effects of cyproheptadine plus haloperidol in the treatment of autistic disorder. Children between the ages 3 and 11 years (inclusive) with a DSM IV clinical diagnosis of autism and who were outpatients from a specialty clinic for children at Roozbeh Psychiatric Teaching Hospital were recruited. The children presented with a chief complaint of severely disruptive symptoms related to autistic disorder. Patients were randomly allocated to cyproheptadine + haloperidol (Group A) or haloperidol + placebo (Group B) for an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The dose of haloperidol and cyproheptadine was titrated up to 0.05 and 0.2 mg/kg/day respectively. Patients were assessed by a third-year resident of psychiatry at baseline and after 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks of starting medication. The primary measure of the outcome was the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist-Community (ABC-C) and the secondary measure of the outcome was the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (relating to people and verbal communication). Side effects and extrapyramidal symptoms were systematically recorded throughout the study and were assessed using a checklist and the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale, administered by a resident of psychiatry during weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8. The ABC-C and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale scores improved with cyproheptadine. The behaviour of the two treatments was not homogeneous across time (groups-by-time interaction, Greenhouse-Geisser correction; F = 7.30, d.f. = 1.68, P = 0.002; F = 8.21, d.f. = 1.19, P = 0.004 respectively).

No significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of extrapyramidal symptoms (P = 0.23). The difference between the two groups in the frequency of side effects was not significant. The results suggest that the combination of cyproheptadine with a conventional antipsychotic may be superior to conventional antipsychotic alone for children with autistic disorder.

Risperidone-treated subjects also exhibited significantly greater decreases on the other 4 subscales of the ABC; on the conduct problem, insecure/anxious, hyperactive, and overly sensitive subscales of the Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form (parent version); and on the Visual Analog Scale of the most troublesome symptom. More risperidone-treated subjects (87%) showed global improvement in their condition compared with the placebo group (40%). Somnolence, the most frequently reported adverse event, was noted in 72.5% versus 7.7% of subjects (risperidone vs placebo) and seemed manageable with dose/dose-schedule modification. Risperidone-treated subjects experienced statistically significantly greater increases in weight (2.7 vs 1.0 kg), pulse rate, and systolic blood pressure. Extrapyramidal symptoms scores were comparable between groups. Risperidone was well tolerated and efficacious in treating behavioral symptoms associated with PDD in children.","Shea Sarah, Turgay Atilla, Carroll Alan, Schulz Miklos, Orlik Herbert, Smith Isabel, Dunbar Fiona","Pediatrics","Aggression, Antipsychotic Agents, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Child, Preschool, Dopamine Antagonists, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Irritable Mood, Male, Risperidone, Serotonin Antagonists, Treatment Outcome","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15492353","IWK Health Centre, and Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. sarah.shea@iwk.nshealth.ca",

While the selective serotonin-receptive inhibitor fluvoxamine has been shown to be effective in adults with autism, as yet no published placebo controlled trials with these agents document safety and efficacy in children with autism. This study examines the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor liquid fluoxetine in the treatment of repetitive behaviors in childhood and adolescent autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). In total, 45 child or adolescent patients with ASD were randomized into two acute 8-week phases in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study of liquid fluoxetine. Study design included two randomized 8-week fluoxetine and placebo phases separated by a 4-week washout phase. Outcome measures included measures of repetitive behaviors and global improvement. Low-dose liquid fluoxetine (mean final dose: 9.9+/-4.35 mg/day) was superior to placebo in the treatment of repetitive behaviors by CY-BOCS compulsion scale. The effect size was in the moderate to large range, and the doses used were low. Liquid fluoxetine was only slightly, and not significantly, superior to placebo on CGI autism score partially due to a phase order effect. However, fluoxetine was marginally superior to placebo on a composite measure of global effectiveness. Liquid fluoxetine did not significantly differ from placebo on treatment emergent side effects. Liquid fluoxetine in low doses is more effective than placebo in the treatment of repetitive behaviors in childhood autism. Limitations include small sample size and the crossover design of the study. Further replication and long-term maintenance trials are needed.","Hollander Eric, Phillips Ann, Chaplin William, Zagursky Karen, Novotny Sherie, Wasserman Stacey, Iyengar Rupa","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Administration, Oral, Adolescent, Autistic Disorder, Child, Cross-Over Studies, Cumulative Trauma Disorders, Female, Fluoxetine, Humans, Male, Placebos, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, Treatment Outcome","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15602505","Seaver and New York Autism Center of Excellence, New York, NY 10029, USA. eric.hollander@mssm.edu",

The intervention combined aspects of behavior therapy, peer modeling and naturalistic communication strategies. Close interaction and joint attention to task play an important role in both group and individual therapy activities. The goal of treatment was to improve social competence (SC) which was construed as reflecting three components: (1) motivation to initiate social contact with peers; (2) ability to sustain interaction with peers for a period of time: and (3) overcoming autistic symptoms of aloofness and rigidity. Measures for the first two variables were based on observation of subjects in unstructured situations with peers; and the third variable was assessed using a structured rating scale, the SI subscale of the GARS. Results revealed significant improvement on all three measures at both 12 and 24 weeks with no evidence of gains during the waiting list period. No gender differences were found on outcome, and age of clients was not correlated with outcome.

Fifty-two outpatients with DSM-IV borderline personality disorder were randomly assigned to receive divalproex (N=20) or placebo (N=32), double-blind, for 12 weeks. Trait impulsivity symptoms were determined by using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, and state aggression symptoms were determined by using the Overt Aggression Scale modified for outpatients. Affective stability was determined by using the Young Mania Rating Scale and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Analyses were performed to identify possible baseline symptom domains that predict treatment response. Divalproex was superior to placebo in reducing impulsive aggression in patients with borderline personality disorder. Divalproex-treated patients responded better than placebo-treated patients among those with higher baseline trait impulsivity symptoms and state aggression symptoms. The effects of baseline trait impulsivity and state aggression appear to be independent of one another. However, baseline affective instability did not influence differential treatment response.

So far the genetics researches of the SLC6A4 gene have given conflicting results. The aim of study was to investigate the association between the SLC6A4 gene and autism in the Chinese Han population. The present study was conducted with the detection of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP(S)) located within the SLC6A4 gene by using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP) analysis. We performed a family-based association study of these polymorphisms in 175 Chinese Han family trios. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) measurement (D') analysis showed the presence of LD between markers across the locus. No significant evidence of association was found at any of the markers detected by using the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) and haplotype analyses in all samples and male samples.

This article explores the reasons for the observed placebo effects, focusing on the heightening of positive expectancy by media attention and by the sensory experiences associated with intravenous injections. Comparisons are drawn with research involving other novel treatments and other clinical populations of children with developmental disabilities and neurobehavioral disorders. Research regarding mechanisms of placebo effects is reviewed, including patient and clinician attributes, expectancy effects, participation effects, changes in caregiver behavior, and conditioning. New evidence regarding the biological basis of placebo effects is briefly presented. Since placebo effects are ubiquitous and may operate by a variety of mechanisms, research design is critical in designing clinical trials and in evaluating other outcomes research. Measurement issues important for research in developmental disabilities are emphasized. Ethical concerns have been raised regarding the use of placebo in clinical research, but current analysis suggests that placebo controls are necessary and defensible on ethical grounds, if certain conditions are met. The study of placebo effects (""placebology"") holds great promise as a new area of research in therapeutics. The author's research in the potential augmentation of stimulant effects in children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) by adding placebo in open label is briefly presented.

All patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) in this clinical trial had been allocated into 4 groups: placebo therapy group, vitamin D addition calcium therapy group, hormone replacement treatment (HRT) therapy group, and risedronate therapy group. We measured the bone mineral density (BMD) and quality of life sale (QOLS) of patients in three times, before the treatment, 3 months after the treatment,and 12 months after the treatment. The differences of the QOL and BMD at the 4 groups and at different time, the linear correlation of the change of QOL and the change of BMD, were both compared after the measurement. The total score of QOL and the score of disease domain and physical domain of HRT therapy group and risedronate therapy group were higher than the placebo therapy group (F = 17. 335, P <0.001), but vitamin D addition calcium therapy group was not different from that of the placebo therapy group. The score of other three domains had no statistically significant difference among the 4 groups. The score of disease domain of the patients of risedronate therapy group started to increase after 3 months of treatment, and continued to increase after 12 months of treatment. The score of disease domain of the patients of HRT therapy group started to increase only after 12 months of treatment. But the score of disease domain of the patients of vitamin D addition calcium therapy group did not increase after 12 months of treatment. The changes of the score of disease domain had the linar correlation with the changes of BMD, and the correlation coefficient was from 0.608 to 0.827.

We carried out a systematic review to assess the evidence of effectiveness and unintended effects associated with MMR. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to December 2004), EMBASE (1974 to December 2004), Biological Abstracts (from 1985 to December 2004), and Science Citation Index (from 1980 to December 2004). Results from reviews, handsearching and from the consultation of manufacturers and authors were also used. Eligible studies were comparative prospective or retrospective trials testing the effects of MMR compared to placebo, do-nothing or a combination of measles, mumps and rubella antigens on healthy individuals up to 15 years of age. These studies were carried out or published by 2004. We identified 139 articles possibly satisfying our inclusion criteria and included 31 in the review. MMR was associated with a lower incidence of upper respiratory tract infections, a higher incidence of irritability, and similar incidence of other adverse effects compared to placebo. The vaccine was likely to be associated with benign thrombocytopenic purpura, parotitis, joint and limb complaints, febrile convulsions within two weeks of vaccination and aseptic meningitis (mumps) (Urabe strain-containing MMR). Exposure to MMR was unlikely to be associated with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, autism or aseptic meningitis (mumps) (Jeryl-Lynn strain-containing MMR). We could not identify studies assessing the effectiveness of MMR that fulfilled our inclusion criteria even though the impact of mass immunisation on the elimination of the diseases has been largely demonstrated. The design and reporting of safety outcomes in MMR vaccine studies, both pre- and post-marketing, are largely inadequate. The evidence of adverse events following immunisation with MMR cannot be separated from its role in preventing the target diseases.","Demicheli V, Jefferson T, Rivetti A, Price D","The Cochrane database of systematic reviews","Adolescent, Autistic Disorder, Child, Clinical Trials as Topic, Crohn Disease, Humans, Measles, Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine, Mumps, Rubella, Vaccines, Attenuated","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16235361","Servizo Sovrazonale di Epidemiologia, ASL 20, Via Venezia 6, Alessandria, Piemonte, Italy 15100. demichelivittorio@asl20.piemonte.it",

Children were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: intervention for child only, intervention for child and parent, wait-list control. The two intervention groups demonstrated significant decreases in parent-reported anxiety symptoms at follow-up and a significant increase in the child's ability to generate positive strategies in an anxiety-provoking situation. There were a number of significant differences between the two interventions to suggest parent involvement as beneficial. The sample of children with AS in this study presented with a profile of anxiety similar to a sample of clinically diagnosed anxious children.

Autistic children (13 boys, 7 girls) were given a single oral dose of 2.5 mg (2-3 years) or 5.0 mg (4-6 years). Blood was collected for 8 hours, and plasma was assayed for buspirone and its metabolite 1-pyrimidinylpiperazine (1-PP). The peak concentration of buspirone averaged 1141 +/- 748 pg/mL with a time to maximum concentration of 0.8 hours. Half-life was 1.6 +/- 0.3 hours. Peak concentrations of 1-PP were 4.5-fold higher than for buspirone. Girls had higher peak concentrations (1876 vs 746 pg/mL) for buspirone and a lower peak 1-PP/buspirone concentration ratio. These results suggest that buspirone is rapidly absorbed and eliminated in young children with extensive metabolism to 1-PP.

Two metropolitan and two rural regions were randomly allocated to intervention groups (n = 70) or control (n = 35). The parents of consecutive children with autism (2(1/2)-5 years old) from the autism assessment services for the intervention regions were then randomly allocated to either a 20-week manual-based parent education and behavior management intervention (n = 35) or a manual-based parent education and counseling intervention (n = 35). The main outcome measure of parental mental health was the General Health Questionnaire used pre- and postintervention and at 6-month follow-up. Both treatments resulted in significant and progressive improvement in overall mental health at follow-up (F = 2, 97, p =.007) and mental health significantly improved over time in the 54% of principal caregivers who had the highest levels of mental health problems. The parent education and behavior management intervention was effective in alleviating a greater percentage of anxiety, insomnia, and somatic symptoms and family dysfunction than parent education and counseling at 6-month follow-up.

A quasi-experimental design was used, with assignment to groups based on parental preference. Assessments were conducted by independent examiners for IQ (Bayley Scales of Infant Development or Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence), language (Reynell Developmental Language Scales), nonverbal skill (Merrill-Palmer Scale of Mental Tests), and adaptive behavior (Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales). Analyses of covariance, with baseline scores as covariates and Year 1-3 assessments as repeated measures, revealed that, with treatment, the EIBT group obtained significantly higher IQ (F = 5.21, p = .03) and adaptive behavior scores (F = 7.84, p = .01) than did the comparison group. No difference between groups was found in either language comprehension (F = 3.82, p = .06) or nonverbal skill. Six of the 21 EIBT children were fully included into regular education without assistance at Year 3, and 11 others were included with support; in contrast, only 1 comparison child was placed primarily in regular education.

This study investigated the influence on steroidogenesis of an interleukin-6 (IL-6)-neutralizing strategy using IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibodies (referred to as MRA). In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study over 12 weeks in 29 patients with RA being treated with prednisolone, 13 of whom received placebo and 16 of whom received 8 mg MRA/kg body weight, the effects of MRA on serum levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulfate (DHEAS), androstenedione (ASD), estrone, and 17beta-estradiol, as well as their respective molar ratios, were determined. MRA therapy markedly improved clinical signs of inflammation (the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, swollen joint score, and Disease Activity Score in 28 joints). Serum levels of ACTH and cortisol and the molar ratio of cortisol to ACTH did not change. Although serum levels of DHEA and DHEAS remained stable during therapy, the DHEAS:DHEA molar ratio significantly decreased in treated patients (P = 0.048). Serum levels of ASD as well as the ASD:cortisol and ASD:17OHP molar ratios increased in MRA-treated patients (minimum P < 0.004). Serum levels of estrone and 17beta-estradiol did not change. but the estrone:ASD molar ratio (an indicator of aromatization) decreased during 12 weeks of MRA treatment (P = 0.001).

As a target of intervention, improvements in cognition may lead to improvements in functional outcome. The present paper is the first report, to our knowledge, on the neurocognitive effects of aripiprazole. Unlike other second-generation antipsychotics, aripiprazole is a D(2) and D(3) receptor partial agonist. It is unknown what effects this unusual pharmacological profile may yield on neurocognition. The present open-label study included data on 169 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were randomly treated with aripiprazole or olanzapine. Subjects received a neurocognitive battery at baseline, week 8, and 26. The aripiprazole group had a significantly greater dropout rate than the olanzapine group. Neurocognitive data were reduced through a principal components analysis that yielded a three-factor solution. The factors were general cognitive functioning, executive functioning, and verbal learning. For general cognitive functioning, both groups improved from baseline and the effects were relatively stable over the 26-week protocol. There were no differential treatment effects. For executive functioning, neither group improved significantly from baseline. For verbal learning, the aripiprazole group improved significantly from baseline to the 8th and 26th week of assessment, and there was a between-group effect favoring aripiprazole over olanzapine that was largely attributable to the differences in performance within the 8th week. Separate analyses were conducted for a measure of sustained attention (Continuous Performance Test-Identical Pairs). There were no differential treatment effects on this measure. The findings from this open-label study suggest that the neurocognitive effects of aripiprazole are at least as good as those of olanzapine.","Kern Robert S, Green Michael F, Cornblatt Barbara A, Owen J Randall, McQuade Robert D, Carson William H, Ali Mirza, Marcus Ron","Psychopharmacology","Adult, Antipsychotic Agents, Aripiprazole, Benzodiazepines, Brain, Cognition, Female, Humans, Learning, Male, Memory, Middle Aged, Olanzapine, Piperazines, Quinolones","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16810506","Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90073, and Zucker Hillside Hospital, North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, Glen Oaks, NY, USA. rkern@ucla.edu",

It was also superior on a 0 to 3 rating of nine DSM-IV ADHD hyperactive/impulsive symptoms (p =.005, d = 1.27), but missed significance on nine inattentive symptoms (p =.053, d= 0.89). Nine subjects responded to ATX, four to placebo (25% improvement on the Hyperactivity subscale plus Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement of 1-2. One was rehospitalized for recurrent violence on ATX. Adverse events were otherwise tolerable, with no tendency to stereotypy. ATX appears safe and effective for treating hyperactivity in some children with autism spectrum disorders. The effect appears as large as in a multisite methylphenidate trial in the same population, with fewer intolerable side effects.

BioSTAR is a novel, bioabsorbable, atrial septal repair implant. This phase I pilot study evaluates the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of BioSTAR for the first time in humans. We conducted a prospective, open-label, multicenter clinical study in 58 patients aged 28 to 68 years who had a clinically significant ASD or PFO. Percutaneous shunt closure was undertaken with the BioSTAR septal repair implant. Successful device implantation was achieved in 57 (98%) of 58 patients. Closure at 30 days and 6 months, assessed by contrast transthoracic echocardiography, was 48 (92%) of 52 and 54 (96%) of 56, respectively. There was no evidence of a clinically significant response to the device. Transient atrial arrhythmia occurred in 5 patients after implantation. No major safety issues were observed. This study demonstrates the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of BioSTAR for the closure of ASD and PFO in humans with a high rate of early and complete shunt closure. BioSTAR is a novel septal repair implant designed to provide biological closure of atrial-level defects using the patient's natural healing response. Because 90% to 95% of the implant is absorbed and replaced with healthy native tissue, future access to the left atrium may be achieved.","Mullen Michael J, Hildick-Smith David, De Giovanni Joseph V, Duke Christopher, Hillis W Stewart, Morrison W Lindsay, Jux Christian","Circulation","Absorbable Implants, Adult, Aged, Echocardiography, Feasibility Studies, Female, Heart Septal Defects, Atrial, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Pilot Projects","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17062781","Royal Brompton Hospital, Sydney Street, London, SW3 6NP, England, United Kingdom. m.mullen@rbht.nhs.uk",

Whereas the safety and efficacy of risperidone have been established for children aged 5 and older, they has not been adequately tested in preschool children. A randomized placebo-controlled study of risperidone in preschool children was conducted in a sample of young children, most of whom were also undergoing intensive behavioral treatment. Preschool children tolerated low-dose risperidone well with no serious adverse effects observed over a 6-month treatment period. Weight gain and hypersalivation were the most common side effects reported, and hyperprolactinemia without lactation or related signs was observed. Significant differences between groups found at baseline complicated the analyses; however, controlling for some of these differences revealed that preschoolers on risperidone demonstrated greater improvements in autism severity. The change in autism severity scores from baseline to 6-month follow up for the risperidone group was 8% compared to 3% for the placebo group. Notably, both groups significantly improved over the 6-month treatment period. Study findings suggest that risperidone is well tolerated in preschoolers over a 6-month period, but that only minimally greater improvement in target symptoms was evident in the risperidone group, possibly due to the differences between groups at baseline or due to the small sample size. Although these findings are not sufficient to direct treatment, they suggest that larger-scale, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigations of risperidone in preschoolers with ASDs should now be conducted.","Luby Joan, Mrakotsky Christine, Stalets Melissa Meade, Belden Andy, Heffelfinger Amy, Williams Meghan, Spitznagel Edward","Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology","Antipsychotic Agents, Anxiety, Autistic Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Child Behavior Disorders, Child, Preschool, Combined Modality Therapy, Depression, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Double-Blind Method, Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions, Early Intervention, Educational, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Hyperprolactinemia, Male, Personality Assessment, Risperidone, Sialorrhea, Weight Gain","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17069546","Department of Psychiatry, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63117, USA. lubyj@msnotes.wustl.edu",

Recently developed nonpsychostimulant treatments have allowed certain patients to switch from a psychostimulant to a nonpsychostimulant. However, the outcomes of such switches have not been systematically studied. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess treatment tolerance and efficacy during a cross-taper transition from methylphenidate or amphetamine to atomoxetine among children and adolescents with ADHD. This pilot study was conducted in patients (aged 6-17 years) with incomplete responses (failure to obtain full reduction/elimination of symptoms) or intolerance of adverse events (AEs) during psychostimulant treatment. Patients continued ongoing psychostimulant treatment during the first week of the study. Transition to atomoxetine began by administering atomoxetine 0.5 mg/kg . d plus full-dose psychostimulant for 1 week, followed in the second week by 1.2 mg/kg . d atomoxetine plus half-dose psychostimulant. Patients remained on 1.2 mg/kg . d atomoxetine monotherapy for the remaining 5 weeks. This stepwise transition was enacted due to the difference in pharmacodynamics between the psychostimulants and atomoxetine. Applying a stepwise cross-titration allowed for better control of ADHD symptoms during the intervening period. Change in ADHD symptoms, as measured by the mean change in the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-IV-Parent Version: Investigator-administered and -scored (ADHDRS-IV-Parent:Inv), was assessed from baseline to end point. Of the 62 subjects enrolled in the study, 39 (62.9%) were diagnosed as ADHD-combined type. Similar proportions were receiving methylphenidate (51.6%) and amphetamine (48.4%). Slightly more wished to switch due to inadequate response (53.2%) than intolerability (46.8%). Nine subjects discontinued at various times during the course of the study (patient or parent/caregiver decision [4], AE [2], protocol violation [2], and lack of efficacy [1]).

For the past few years, we have been observing 2- to 4-year-old children with autism interacting with Keepon, a creature-like robot that is only capable of expressing its attention (directing its gaze) and emotions (pleasure and excitement). While controlled by a remote experimenter, Keepon interacted with the children with its simple appearance and actions. With a sense of curiosity and security, the children spontaneously approached Keepon and engaged in dyadic interaction with it, which then extended to triadic interactions where they exchanged with adult caregivers pleasure and surprise they found in Keepon. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of these unfolding interactions suggests that autistic children possess the motivation to share mental states with others, which is contrary to the commonly held position that this motivation is impaired in autism. We assume Keepon's minimal expressiveness helped the children understand socially meaningful information, which then activated their intact motivation to share interests and feelings with others. We conclude that simple robots like Keepon would facilitate social interaction and its development in autistic children.","Kozima Hideki, Nakagawa Cocoro, Yasuda Yuriko","Progress in brain research","Autistic Disorder, Child, Preschool, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Female, Humans, Infant, Interpersonal Relations, Male, Pilot Projects, Play and Playthings, Robotics, Social Behavior","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17920443","National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Hikaridai 3-5, Seika, Soraku, Kyoto 619-0289, Japan. xkozima@nict.go.jp",

Cognitive abilities and autism severity were measured by standardized tests. Three pre-intervention cognitive level groups: normal (IQ>90), borderline (70<IQ<89) and impaired (50<IQ<69) were examined. The impaired group had more severe autism symptoms than the borderline and the normal cognitive groups. However, following intervention the groups did not differ in the change in core autism symptoms. IQ scores increased significantly more in the autism group than in the DD group. IQ improvements correlated significantly with reduction in autism symptoms and mostly in stereotyped behaviors. Cognitive ability in autism is associated with autism severity. Two distinct subtypes based on cognitive level are identified. However, baseline cognitive level cannot predict the progress rate in autism symptoms with intervention.

Therefore, it was of interest to assess the efficacy of piracetam, a positive modulator of AMPA-sensitive glutamate receptors in autistic disorder. About 40 children between the ages three and 11 years (inclusive) with a DSM IV clinical diagnosis of autism and who were outpatients from a specialty clinic for children were recruited. The children presented with a chief complaint of severely disruptive symptoms related to autistic disorder. Patients were randomly allocated to piracetam + risperidone (Group A) or placebo + risperidone (Group B) for a 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The dose of risperidone was titrated up to 2 mg/day for children between 10 and 40 kg and 3 mg/day for children weighting above 40 kg. The dose of piracetam was titrated up to 800 mg/day. Patients were assessed at baseline and after 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks of starting medication. The measure of the outcome was the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) Rating Scale (total score). The ABC-C Rating Scale scores improved with piracetam. The difference between the two protocols was significant as indicated by the effect of group, the between subjects factor (F = 5.85, d.f. = 1, P = 0.02).

Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated positive effects in both short-term and longer term studies. The evidence suggests that early intervention programs are indeed beneficial for children with autism, often improving developmental functioning and decreasing maladaptive behaviors and symptom severity at the level of group analysis. Whether such changes lead to significant improvements in terms of greater independence and vocational and social functioning in adulthood is also unknown. Given the few randomized controlled treatment trials that have been carried out, the few models that have been tested, and the large differences in interventions that are being published, it is clear that the field is still very early in the process of determining (a) what kinds of interventions are most efficacious in early autism, (b) what variables moderate and mediate treatment gains and improved outcomes following intervention, and (c) the degree of both short-term and long-term improvements that can reasonably be expected. To examine these current research needs, the empirical studies of comprehensive treatments for young children with autism published since 1998 were reviewed. Lovaas's treatment meet Chambless and colleague's (Chambless et al., 1998; Chambless et al., 1996) criteria for ""well-established"" and no treatment meets the ""probably efficacious"" criteria, though three treatments meet criteria for ""possibly efficacious"" (Chambless & Hollon, 1998). Most studies were either Type 2 or 3 in terms of their methodological rigor based on Nathan and Gorman's (2002) criteria.

Recent behavioral evidence shows that the neuropeptide oxytocin increases trust among humans, thus offering a unique chance of gaining a deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying trust and the adaptation to breach of trust. We examined the neural circuitry of trusting behavior by combining the intranasal, double-blind, administration of oxytocin with fMRI. We find that subjects in the oxytocin group show no change in their trusting behavior after they learned that their trust had been breached several times while subjects receiving placebo decrease their trust. This difference in trust adaptation is associated with a specific reduction in activation in the amygdala, the midbrain regions, and the dorsal striatum in subjects receiving oxytocin, suggesting that neural systems mediating fear processing (amygdala and midbrain regions) and behavioral adaptations to feedback information (dorsal striatum) modulate oxytocin's effect on trust. These findings may help to develop deeper insights into mental disorders such as social phobia and autism, which are characterized by persistent fear or avoidance of social interactions.","Baumgartner Thomas, Heinrichs Markus, Vonlanthen Aline, Fischbacher Urs, Fehr Ernst","Neuron","Adaptation, Psychological, Adult, Analysis of Variance, Brain, Brain Mapping, Double-Blind Method, Games, Experimental, Humans, Image Processing, Computer-Assisted, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Nerve Net, Oxygen, Oxytocin, Psychometrics, Reaction Time, Risk-Taking, Surveys and Questionnaires, Trust","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18498743","Center for the Study of Social and Neural Systems, Institute for Empirical Research in Economics, University of Zurich, Blumlisalpstrasse 10, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland. t.baumgartner@iew.uzh.ch",

Cognitive behavioral therapy for ASD may prevent PTSD, but trauma survivors may not tolerate exposure-based therapy in the acute phase. There is a need to compare nonexposure therapy techniques with prolonged exposure for ASD. To determine the efficacy of exposure therapy or trauma-focused cognitive restructuring in preventing chronic PTSD relative to a wait-list control group. A randomized controlled trial of civilians who experienced trauma and who met the diagnostic criteria for ASD (N = 90) seen at an outpatient clinic between March 1, 2002, and June 30, 2006. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 5 weekly 90-minute sessions of either imaginal and in vivo exposure (n = 30) or cognitive restructuring (n = 30), or assessment at baseline and after 6 weeks (wait-list group; n = 30). Measures of PTSD at the 6-month follow-up visit by clinical interview and self-report assessments of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and trauma-related cognition. Intent-to-treat analyses indicated that at posttreatment, fewer patients in the exposure group had PTSD than those in the cognitive restructuring or wait-list groups (33% vs 63% vs 77%; P = .002). At follow-up, patients who underwent exposure therapy were more likely to not meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD than those who underwent cognitive restructuring (37% vs 63%; odds ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-3.94; P = .05) and to achieve full remission (47% vs 13%; odds ratio, 2.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-6.83; P = .005). On assessments of PTSD, depression, and anxiety, exposure resulted in markedly larger effect sizes at posttreatment and follow-up than cognitive restructuring. Exposure-based therapy leads to greater reduction in subsequent PTSD symptoms in patients with ASD when compared with cognitive restructuring. Exposure should be used in early intervention for people who are at high risk for developing PTSD.","Bryant Richard A, Mastrodomenico Julie, Felmingham Kim L, Hopwood Sally, Kenny Lucy, Kandris Eva, Cahill Catherine, Creamer Mark","Archives of general psychiatry","Accidents, Traffic, Adaptation, Psychological, Adult, Chronic Disease, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Desensitization, Psychologic, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Patient Satisfaction, Personality Assessment, Risk Factors, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic, Stress Disorders, Traumatic, Acute, Violence","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18519824","School of Psychology, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales 2052, Australia.

"19068339","10.1016/J.Encep.2007.10.011","[Substitutive and dietetic approaches in childhood autistic disorder: interests and limits].","2008-10-01","Autism is a developmental disorder that requires specialized therapeutic approaches. Influenced by various theoretical hypotheses, therapeutic programs are typically structured on a psychodynamic, biological or educative basis. Presently, educational strategies are recommended in the treatment of autism, without excluding other approaches when they are necessary. Some authors recommend dietetic or complementary approaches to the treatment of autism, which often stimulates great interest in the parents but also provokes controversy for professionals. Nevertheless, professionals must be informed about this approach because parents are actively in demand of it. First of all, enzymatic disorders and metabolic errors are those most frequently evoked in the literature. The well-known phenylalanine hydroxylase deficit responsible for phenylketonuria has been described as being associated with autism. In this case, adapted diet prevents mental retardation and autistic symptoms. Some enzymatic errors are also corrected by supplementation with uridine or ribose for example, but these supplementations are the responsibility of specialized medical teams in the domain of neurology and cannot be applied by parents alone. Secondly, increased opoid activity due to an excess of peptides is also supposed to be at the origin of some autistic symptoms. Gluten-free or casein-free diets have thus been tested in controlled studies, with contradictory results. With such diets, some studies show symptom regression but others report negative side effects, essentially protein malnutrition. Methodological bias, small sample sizes, the use of various diagnostic criteria or heterogeneity of evaluation interfere with data analysis and interpretation, which prompted professionals to be cautious with such diets. The third hypothesis emphasized in the literature is the amino acid domain. Some autistic children lack some amino acids such as glutamic or aspartic acids for example and this deficiency would create autistic symptoms. However, for some authors, these deficits are attributed to nutritional deficits caused by the food selectivity of children. A fourth hypothesis concerning metabolic implication in autism is the suspicion that a food allergy phenomenon could interfere with development, and it has been observed that Ig levels are higher in autistic children than in control children. Autistic children with a positive reaction to food Ig would have a more favourable outcome with diet excluding some kinds of food; but most of those diets are drastic and ethically debatable. Fifth, glucidic catabolism could be deleterious with an excess of ketonic products that will initiate comitial seizures. Few studies with ketogenic diet have been conducted but, as it has been described with epileptic subjects, those diets would diminish autistic symptoms. Not enough studies have been conducted that would allow one to draw any firm conclusions. The sixth hypothesis is linked with vitamin deficiencies that are a notably important area of research in the treatment of autism. Vitamin B12 or B6 deficiencies have been studied in several articles, and many of them were controlled studies. French teams also emphasize an interest in supplementation with B12 or B6. The two last hypotheses concern auto-immune patterns and the toxic effects of heavy metals like mercury. There is a paucity of methodologically satisfying studies that support these two hypotheses and diet recommendations. Following these assumptions, some dietetic approaches have been recommended, even though the methodological aspects of supporting studies are poor. The most famous diet is the gluten-free and/or casein-free diet. Only two controlled studies attracted our attention. Even if for some autistic children such a diet was positive, for others, gluten-free or casein-free diets were poorly tolerated and, for some authors, not without considerable side effects, the more prejudicial of which was the Kwashiorkor risk. Ketogenic diets have been studied in one non controlled study, but even if positive results have been noted by the authors, the ketogenic diet is very restricting and the long term effects have not been evaluated. Vitamin supplementation is the one and only diet domain where there have been many repeated and placebo-controlled studies. Side effects are rare and mild even if high doses of vitamin B6 are advocated in these studies. In total, as evoked by Rimland, 11 controlled placebo-blind studies have been conducted and 50% of autistic children with this supplementation had improved autistic signs. However, these results still remain debated. Finally, more rarely, enzymatic abnormalities need specific diets which have some positive consequences, but such diets could not be applied by parents alone and are the responsibility of specialized teams. For discussion purposes we can emphasize that, in spite of the amount of studies concerning the effects of specialized diets, few are methodologically satisfying. We can not ignore that some side effects are possible with such approaches and parents need to be informed of them. Some are even potentially serious, such as diets with metal chelators. In spite of those results, vitamin supplementation seems to be the only one that some specialized teams in autism could apply, always with parent agreement. In conclusion, within this scientific field, studies on eating habits of autistic children should be conducted because of their food selectivity or avoidance.","Hjiej H, Doyen C, Couprie C, Kaye K, Contejean Y","L'Encephale","Autistic Disorder, Child, Complementary Therapies, Diet Therapy, Dietary Supplements, Humans, Vitamins","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19068339","Service de psychopathologie de l'enfant et de l'adolescent, centre hospitalier Sainte-Anne, 14, rue Cabanis, 75014 Paris, France.",

This review provides evidence for the effectiveness of EIBI for some, but not all, preschool children with autism.","Howlin Patricia, Magiati Iliana, Charman Tony","American journal on intellectual and developmental disabilities","Autistic Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Case-Control Studies, Child Behavior Disorders, Child, Preschool, Early Intervention, Educational, Female, Humans, Intelligence, Male, Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Treatment Outcome","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19143460","Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College, London, UK. patricia.howlin@iop.kcl.ac.uk",

Data from 2 identical 14-week studies (an 8-week prospective ADT treatment phase and a 6-week randomized, double-blind phase) of aripiprazole augmentation were pooled to evaluate efficacy and safety in the 2 subgroups. The primary efficacy endpoint was mean change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score from end of ADT treatment to end of randomized treatment (last observation carried forward). Anxious depression was defined by a Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression anxiety/somatization factor score ≥ 7, and atypical depression was defined by previously described criteria on the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report. Both anxious and atypical subtypes were defined based on symptoms at entry into prospective ADT (week 0). Patients were enrolled between June 2004 and April 2006 in one study and from September 2004 to December 2006 in the other (total randomized population, N = 742; anxious/nonanxious population, N = 740; atypical/nonatypical population, N = 737). Completion rates were between 84% and 90% and comparable across all subgroups, with low discontinuations due to adverse events. Patients receiving adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated significantly greater improvement in MADRS total score versus patients receiving adjunctive placebo, starting at week 1 or week 2 and continuing through to endpoint (anxious: -8.72 vs. -6.17, p ≤ .001; nonanxious: -8.61 vs. -4.97, p ≤ .001; atypical: -9.31 vs. -5.15, p ≤ .001; nonatypical: -8.08 vs. -6.22, p < .05).

Human promoter-region microsatellite repeat regions (RS1 and RS3) in the AVPR1a gene region have been associated with autism spectrum disorders, prosocial behavior and social cognition. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle response to auditory stimuli is a largely autonomic response that resonates with social cognition in both animal models and humans. Reduced PPI has been observed in disorders including schizophrenia that are distinguished by deficits in social skills. In the current investigation association was examined between PPI and the AVPR1a RS1 and RS repeat regions and PPI in a group of 113 nonclinical subjects. Using a robust family-based strategy, association was observed between AVPR1a promoter-region repeat length, especially RS3) and PPI (30 ms: global p=0.04; 60 ms p=0.006; 120 ms p=0.008). Notably, longer RS3 alleles were associated with greater levels of prepulse inhibition. Using a short/long classification scheme for the repeat regions, significant association was also observed between all three PPI intervals (30, 60 and 120 ms) and both RS1 and RS3 polymorphisms (PBAT: FBAT-PC(2) statistic p=0.047). Tests of within-subject effects (SPSS GLM) showed significant sexxRS3 interactions at 30 ms (p=0.045) and 60 ms (p=0.01). Longer alleles, especially in male subjects, are associated with significantly higher PPI response, consistent with a role for the promoter repeat region in partially molding social behavior in both animals and humans.

This study tested a modular cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program for children with this profile. A standard CBT program was augmented with multiple treatment components designed to accommodate or remediate the social and adaptive skill deficits of children with ASD that could pose barriers to anxiety reduction. Forty children (7-11 years old) were randomly assigned to 16 sessions of CBT or a 3-month waitlist (36 completed treatment or waitlist). Therapists worked with individual families. The CBT model emphasized behavioral experimentation, parent-training, and school consultation. Independent evaluators blind to treatment condition conducted structured diagnostic interviews and parents and children completed anxiety symptom checklists at baseline and posttreatment/postwaitlist. In intent-to-treat analyses, 78.5% of the CBT group met Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale criteria for positive treatment response at posttreatment, as compared to only 8.7% of the waitlist group. CBT also outperformed the waitlist on diagnostic outcomes and parent reports of child anxiety, but not children's self-reports. Treatment gains were maintained at 3-month follow-up.

This trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of adjunctive aripiprazole versus antidepressant monotherapy in patients with MDD and independently replicated the positive findings of two similar trials. Patients (N=1,147) with MDD experiencing a major depressive episode and a history of inadequate response to antidepressant monotherapy were enrolled (week 0); 827 received single-blind adjunctive placebo plus open-label antidepressant (escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine controlled release, sertraline, or venlafaxine extended release) for 8 weeks to confirm inadequate response to antidepressants; 349 patients with inadequate response were randomized (1:1) to double-blind, adjunctive placebo (n=172) or adjunctive aripiprazole (n=177; 2-20 mg/day). Primary outcome was the mean change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total score from baseline (week 8) to endpoint (week 14). Clinically significant improvements in depressive symptoms as assessed by decreases in the MADRS Total score were greater with adjunctive aripiprazole (-10.1) than placebo (-6.4; P<.001). Remission rates were greater for adjunctive aripiprazole than for adjunctive placebo (week 14, 36.8% vs 18.9%; P<.001). Completion rates with adjunctive aripiprazole and placebo were high (83% vs. 87%) and discontinuations due to adverse events were low (6.2% vs 1.7%). For some patients with MDD who do not obtain adequate symptom relief with antidepressant monotherapy, adjunctive therapies can significantly improve depressive symptoms. As reported, adjunctive aripiprazole was associated with a two-fold higher remission rate than adjunctive placebo. This, and previous studies, have shown that discontinuations due to adverse events were low and completion rates were high, and has indicated that both antidepressant and aripiprazole in combination were relatively well-tolerated and safe. This is the third consecutive clinical trial, in the absence of a failed trial, to demonstrate that aripiprazole augmentation to antidepressants is an efficacious and well-tolerated treatment for patients with MDD who do not respond adequately to standard antidepressant monotherapy (ClinicalTrials.gov study NCT00105196).","Berman Robert M, Fava Maurizio, Thase Michael E, Trivedi Madhukar H, Swanink René, McQuade Robert D, Carson William H, Adson David, Taylor Leslie, Hazel James, Marcus Ronald N","CNS spectrums","Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Antidepressive Agents, Antipsychotic Agents, Aripiprazole, Depressive Disorder, Major, Double-Blind Method, Drug Resistance, Endpoint Determination, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Piperazines, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Quinolones, Treatment Failure, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19407731","Neuroscience Global Clinical Research at Bristol-Myers Squibb, Wallingford, CT 06492, USA.

A literature review was conducted using the medline search term: 'aripiprazole' with limits: Human trials, English language, All Child (aged 0-18 years). Additional articles were identified from reference information and poster presentation data. Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic which was recently approved for use in Canada, but has been available for several years in the United States. Pharmacologically, aripiprazole is a partial agonist at D(2) and 5-HT(1A) receptors and an antagonist at 5-HT(2A) receptors. Randomized controlled trial data is available showing efficacy for aripiprazole in the treatment of children and adolescents with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and behavioural problems associated with autism. Open-label evidence is also available for use of aripiprazole in other disorders such as tic disorders, aggression and disruptive behavior disorders. Unlike some other available atypical antipsychotics, there does not appear to be any effect on QTc interval on the electrocardiogram. Adverse effects including extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), akathisia, sedation, headache, nausea were significant in clinical trials in children and adolescents. The possibility of aripiprazole causing tardive dyskinesia cannot be excluded. In this population, aripiprazole appears to have minimal impact on the metabolic profile compared to most other atypical antipsychotics, with minimal changes in weight or body mass index, no significant changes in glucose or lipid metabolism, and a decrease in serum prolactin. Aripiprazole may represent an important alternative for some children and adolescents who have experienced poor efficacy or significant metabolic adverse effects with their current antipsychotic treatment regimen.","Greenaway Masa'il, Elbe Dean","Journal of the Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry = Journal de l'Academie canadienne de psychiatrie de l'enfant et de l'adolescent",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19718428","Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, BC.",

The children presented with a chief complaint of severely disruptive symptoms related to autistic disorder. Patients were randomly allocated to pentoxifylline+risperidone or placebo+risperidone for a 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The dose of risperidone was titrated up to 3 mg/day, pentoxifylline was titrated to 600 mg/day. Patients were assessed at baseline and after 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks of starting medication. The measure of the outcome was the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C). The difference between the two protocols was significant as the group that received pentoxifylline had greater reduction in ABC-C subscale scores for Irritability, Lethargy/Social Withdrawal, Stereotypic Behavior, Hyperactivity/Noncompliance and Inappropriate Speech. The results suggest that combination of atypical antipsychotic medications and pentoxifylline might have synergistic effects in treatment of behavioral problems of children with autism.","Akhondzadeh Shahin, Fallah Jalil, Mohammadi Mohammad-Reza, Imani Reza, Mohammadi Mohammad, Salehi Bahman, Ghanizadeh Ahmad, Raznahan Maedeh, Mohebbi-Rasa Soodeh, Rezazadeh Shams-Ali, Forghani Saeedeh","Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry","Antipsychotic Agents, Autistic Disorder, Behavioral Symptoms, Child, Child, Preschool, Developmental Disabilities, Double-Blind Method, Drug Administration Schedule, Female, Humans, Male, Pentoxifylline, Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors, Retrospective Studies, Risperidone, Treatment Outcome","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19772883","Psychiatric Research Centre, Roozbeh Psychiatric Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, South Kargar Street, Tehran 13337, Iran. s.akhond@neda.net",

Deficits in the ability to recognize the emotions of others are believed to contribute to this. There is currently no effective treatment for these problems. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design, we administered oxytocin nasal spray (18 or 24 IU) or a placebo to 16 male youth aged 12 to 19 who were diagnosed with Autistic or Asperger's Disorder. Participants then completed the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task, a widely used and reliable test of emotion recognition. In comparison with placebo, oxytocin administration improved performance on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task. This effect was also shown when analysis was restricted to the younger participants aged 12 to 15 who received the lower dose. This study provides the first evidence that oxytocin nasal spray improves emotion recognition in young people diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders.

These results suggest that individuals with autism over-process information needed for the successful differentiation of target and novel stimuli. In the present study we examine the effects of low-frequency, repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) on novelty processing as well as behavior and social functioning in 13 individuals with ASD. Our hypothesis was that low-frequency rTMS application to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC) would result in an alteration of the cortical excitatory/inhibitory balance through the activation of inhibitory GABAergic double bouquet interneurons. We expected to find post-TMS differences in amplitude and latency of early and late ERP components. The results of our current study validate the use of low-frequency rTMS as a modulatory tool that altered the disrupted ratio of cortical excitation to inhibition in autism. After rTMS the parieto-occipital P50 amplitude decreased to novel distracters but not to targets; also the amplitude and latency to targets increased for the frontal P50 while decreasing to non-target stimuli. Low-frequency rTMS minimized early cortical responses to irrelevant stimuli and increased responses to relevant stimuli. Improved selectivity in early cortical responses lead to better stimulus differentiation at later-stage responses as was made evident by our P3b and P3a component findings. These results indicate a significant change in early, middle-latency and late ERP components at the frontal, centro-parietal, and parieto-occipital regions of interest in response to target and distracter stimuli as a result of rTMS treatment. Overall, our preliminary results show that rTMS may prove to be an important research tool or treatment modality in addressing the stimulus hypersensitivity characteristic of autism spectrum disorders.","Sokhadze Estate, Baruth Joshua, Tasman Allan, Mansoor Mehreen, Ramaswamy Rajesh, Sears Lonnie, Mathai Grace, El-Baz Ayman, Casanova Manuel F","Applied psychophysiology and biofeedback","Adolescent, Adult, Autistic Disorder, Behavior, Cerebral Cortex, Child, Electroencephalography, Evoked Potentials, Female, Humans, Hyperkinesis, Interneurons, Male, Mental Processes, Photic Stimulation, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Reaction Time, Social Behavior, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19941058","Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY, 40292, USA. tato.sokhadze@louisville.edu",

Compared with children who received community-intervention, children who received ESDM showed significant improvements in IQ, adaptive behavior, and autism diagnosis. Two years after entering intervention, the ESDM group on average improved 17.6 standard score points (1 SD: 15 points) compared with 7.0 points in the comparison group relative to baseline scores. The ESDM group maintained its rate of growth in adaptive behavior compared with a normative sample of typically developing children. In contrast, over the 2-year span, the comparison group showed greater delays in adaptive behavior. Children who received ESDM also were more likely to experience a change in diagnosis from autism to pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified, than the comparison group. This is the first randomized, controlled trial to demonstrate the efficacy of a comprehensive developmental behavioral intervention for toddlers with ASD for improving cognitive and adaptive behavior and reducing severity of ASD diagnosis.

Looking at the literature undifferentiated by trauma type, there was evidence that trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) are efficacious and specific for PTSD, stress inoculation training, hypnotherapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and psychodynamic therapy are possibly efficacious for PTSD and trauma-focused CBT is possibly efficacious for ASD. Not one of these treatments has been tested with the full range of trauma groups, though there is evidence that trauma-focused CBT is established in efficacy for assault- and road traffic accident-related PTSD. Trauma-focused CBT and to a lesser extent EMDR (due to fewer studies having been conducted and many having had a mixed trauma sample) are the psychological treatments of choice for PTSD, but further research of these and other therapies with different populations is needed.","Ponniah Kathryn, Hollon Steven D","Depression and anxiety","Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Empiricism, Evidence-Based Medicine, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing, Humans, Psychotherapy, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Research, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic, Stress Disorders, Traumatic, Acute, Treatment Outcome","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19957280","New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York, USA. kathrynbetts@hotmail.com",

During 2008 and 2009, there was nearly a quarter increase in the number of behavioral intervention studies, as well as more randomized controlled trials and approaches other than applied behavior analysis. Many of the studies investigated commonly used ASD intervention practices or novel treatments. A few were conducted with underserved populations, such as toddlers and adults with ASD. Social impairment was the focus of the largest number of intervention studies. A small percentage of studies were rated as high-quality. Overall, the reviewed studies suggest that ASD-specific deficits can be improved through behavioral intervention.

In particular, some studies have shown that children with ADHD may have lower concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly omega-3, in their red blood cells and plasma, and that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids may alleviate behavioural symptoms in this population. However, in order to compare levels it seems appropriate to establish fatty acid levels in a mainstream school aged population and if levels relate to learning and behaviour. To date no study has established this. For this study, cheek cell samples from 411 typically developing school children were collected and analysed for PUFA content, in order to establish the range in this population. In addition, measures of general classroom attention and behaviour were assessed in these children by teachers and parents. Cognitive performance tests were also administered in order to explore whether an association between behaviour and/or cognitive performance and PUFA levels exists. Relationships between PUFA levels and socio-economic status were also explored. Measures of reading, spelling and intelligence did not show any association with PUFA levels, but some associations were noted with the level of omega-3 fatty acids and teacher and parental reports of behaviour, with some evidence that higher omega-3 levels were associated with decreased levels of inattention, hyperactivity, emotional and conduct difficulties and increased levels of prosocial behaviour. These findings are discussed in relation to previous findings from omega-3 supplementation studies with children.","Kirby A, Woodward A, Jackson S, Wang Y, Crawford M A","Research in developmental disabilities","Attention, Child, Child Behavior, Cognition, Dietary Supplements, Fatty Acids, Omega-3, Fatty Acids, Omega-6, Female, Humans, Intelligence Tests, Learning, Male, Memory, Short-Term, Mouth Mucosa, Social Behavior, Socioeconomic Factors","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20172688","The Dyscovery Centre, Allt-yr-yn Campus, University of Wales, Newport NP20 5DA, UK.",

Eighty-eight per cent of respondents found the course useful or very useful while parental knowledge and skills improved significantly across a range of learning outcomes. DBC scores showed significant changes post-course for total problem behaviours and disruptive/antisocial behaviours, with a trend towards reductions in anxiety as reported by parents.

Frequently reported adverse events (AEs) that occurred with ARI + LI vs. ARI + VAL were: tremor (17.0% vs. 12.1%), akathisia (6.6% vs. 8.6%), headache (6.6% vs. 4.0%), insomnia (9.4% vs. 10.3%), depression (7.5% vs. 9.2%) and weight increase (11.3% vs. 8.6%).

Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were calculated between changes on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) line items and selected Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS) line items using last observation carried forward. The magnitude of change was expressed as a between-group effect size (ES). At end point, adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated significant improvement versus antidepressant therapy alone in 8 of the 10 MADRS items (MADRS total score Cohen effect size = 0.37) and 12 of the 30 IDS items (IDS total score Cohen ES = 0.18). Analysis of correlation data identified 5 MADRS items assessing mood, lassitude, inability to feel, self-worth, and suicidal thoughts that correlated with similar IDS items; these showed a similar pattern of rapid, sustained response to adjunctive aripiprazole and a similar ES. Other symptoms associated with depression (tension associated with feeling anxious, irritability, and lack of concentration) did not show statistically significant changes on either scale at end point. The IDS identified an additional 3 important depression-related symptoms (diminished libido, view of self, and interpersonal sensitivity) that showed significant rapid and sustained improvement with adjunctive aripiprazole. This cross-correlation analysis confirmed that improvement in core depressive symptoms with adjunctive aripiprazole was identified by both clinicians and patients.

Riluzole is hypothesized to have an inhibitory effect on glutamate release, block excitotoxic effects of glutamate, and potentiate postsynaptic GABA(A) receptor function. Extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) activation is known to be delayed in humans with FXS and knockout animal models of FXS. Correction of delayed ERK activation is a potential biomarker of treatment response in FXS. We conducted a six-week open-label prospective pilot study of riluzole (100 mg/day) in six adults with FXS. Riluzole was started at 50mg every evening and then increased to 50mg twice daily at week 2. The dose was kept constant for the final 4 weeks of the trial. Clinical response was determined by a score of 1 ""very much improved"" or 2 ""much improved"" on the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement (CGI-I) scale and a≥25% improvement on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for Pervasive Developmental Disorders. The primary target of treatment in this study was repetitive, compulsive behavior that commonly occurs in persons with FXS. The study incorporated an ERK activation biomarker assay. Potential adverse effects were assessed in a systematic manner at all clinic visits and by phone between visits. Riluzole treatment was associated with clinical response in 1 of 6 subjects (17%). Among a number of secondary outcome measures employed, significant improvement was only noted on the ADHD Rating Scale-IV (became non-significant when corrected for multiple comparisons). Riluzole use was associated with significant correction in ERK activation time in all subjects (mean change from 3.82±0.27 (baseline) to 2.99±0.26 (endpoint) minutes; p=0.007). Riluzole was well tolerated; mean increases in liver function tests occurred but drug discontinuation was not required. Overall, riluzole use was not associated with significant clinical improvement despite uniform correction of peripheral ERK activation. Future directions of study include testing of riluzole in animal models of FXS and assessment of psychotropic monotherapy on ERK activation.","Erickson Craig A, Weng Ning, Weiler Ivan Jeanne, Greenough William T, Stigler Kimberly A, Wink Logan K, McDougle Christopher J","Brain research","Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists, Fragile X Syndrome, Humans, Male, Neuroprotective Agents, Pilot Projects, Prospective Studies, Riluzole, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21059347","Department of Psychiatry, Indiana University School of Medicine, James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA. crericks@iupui.edu",

Electrophysiological research has provided evidence that gamma band activity (30-80 Hz) is a physiological indicator of the co-activation of cortical cells engaged in processing visual stimuli and integrating different features of a stimulus. A number of studies have found augmented and indiscriminative gamma band power at early stages of visual processing in ASD; this may be related to decreased inhibitory processing and an increase in the ratio of cortical excitation to inhibition. Low frequency or 'slow' (≤1HZ) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been shown to increase inhibition of stimulated cortex by the activation of inhibitory circuits. METHODS: We wanted to test the hypothesis of gamma band abnormalities at early stages of visual processing in ASD by investigating relative evoked (i.e. ~ 100 ms) gamma power in 25 subjects with ASD and 20 age-matched controls using Kanizsa illusory figures. Additionally, we wanted to assess the effects of 12 sessions of bilateral 'slow' rTMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on evoked gamma activity using a randomized controlled design. RESULTS: In individuals with ASD evoked gamma activity was not discriminative of stimulus type, whereas in controls early gamma power differences between target and non-target stimuli were highly significant. Following rTMS individuals with ASD showed significant improvement in discriminatory gamma activity between relevant and irrelevant visual stimuli. We also found significant improvement in the responses on behavioral questionnaires (i.e., irritability, repetitive behavior) as a result of rTMS. CONCLUSION: We proposed that 'slow' rTMS may have increased cortical inhibitory tone which improved discriminatory gamma activity at early stages of visual processing. rTMS has the potential to become an important therapeutic tool in ASD treatment and has shown significant benefits in treating core symptoms of ASD with few, if any side effects.","Baruth Joshua M, Casanova Manuel F, El-Baz Ayman, Horrell Tim, Mathai Grace, Sears Lonnie, Sokhadze Estate","Journal of neurotherapy",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21116441","Department of Anatomical Sciences and Neurobiology, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY 40202.",

After oral administration, RSP is completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and undergoes hydroxylation to yield 9-hydroxyrisperidone (9-OH-RSP), an active metabolite that has a pharmacologic profile and potency similar to RSP. The aims of this study were to compare the relative bioavailability of a pharmaceutical-equivalent (test) formulation with a reference formulation of oral RSP 2 mg, both available commercially on the Brazilian pharmaceutical market, and to generate data regarding the oral bioavailability of the tested drug in healthy Brazilian volunteers. This single-dose, randomized-sequence, open-label, 2-period crossover study was conducted in healthy Brazilian volunteers from August to December 2008. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive the test formulation followed by the reference formulation or vice versa, with a 30-day washout period between doses. Study drugs were administered after a 12-hour overnight fast. For pharmacokinetic analysis, blood samples were drawn at 0 (baseline), 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 3, 5, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours after administration. Plasma concentrations of RSP and 9-OH-RSP were determined using LC-MS/MS. The test and reference formulations were to be considered bioequivalent if the 90% CIs for the geometric mean test/reference ratios were within a predetermined range of 80% to 125%, in accordance with the policies of the Brazilian Sanitary Surveillance Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration. Tolerability was determined using clinical assessments, monitoring of vital signs, analysis of laboratory test results, and subject interviews regarding adverse events. A total of 22 subjects were enrolled (11 men, 11 women; mean [SD] age, 32 [12] years [range, 1858 years]; weight, 70.4 [11.9] kg [range, 50-103 kg]; height, 1.67 [0.08] m [range, 1.56-1.80 m]; and body mass index, 25 [4] kg/m(2) [range, 18-29 kg/m(2)]). For RSP, mean (SD) C(max) values were 12.6 (2.7) and 16.0 (2.3) ng/mL for the test and reference formulations, respectively. For 9-OH-RSP, mean Cmax values were 17.8 (1.3) and 21.0 (1.7) ng/mL for the test and reference formulations. The 90% CIs for the mean test/ reference ratios for RSP C(max), AUC(0-120), and AUC(0-∞) were 74% to 82%, 75% to 85%, and 76% to 85%, respectively, and 83% to 87%, 75% to 79%, and 75% to 78% for 9-OH-RSP. The related adverse events (headache, low back pain, drowsiness, standing hypotension, local postvenipuncture ecchymoses, insomnia, nausea, and vomiting) were transient and mild.

We evaluated the impact of supplementing a comprehensive intervention with a curriculum targeting socially synchronous behavior on social outcomes of toddlers with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Fifty toddlers with ASD, ages 21 to 33 months, were randomized to one of two six-month interventions: Interpersonal Synchrony or Non-Interpersonal Synchrony. The interventions provided identical intensity (10 hours per week in classroom), student-to-teacher ratio, schedule, home-based parent training (1.5 hours per month), parent education (38 hours), and instructional strategies, except the Interpersonal Synchrony condition provided a supplementary curriculum targeting socially engaged imitation, joint attention, and affect sharing; measures of these were primary outcomes. Assessments were conducted pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, and, to assess maintenance, at six-month follow-up. Random effects models were used to examine differences between groups over time. Secondary analyses examined gains in expressive language and nonverbal cognition, and time effects during the intervention and follow-up periods. A significant treatment effect was found for socially engaged imitation (p = .02), with more than doubling (17% to 42%) of imitated acts paired with eye contact in the Interpersonal Synchrony group after the intervention. This skill was generalized to unfamiliar contexts and maintained through follow-up. Similar gains were observed for initiation of joint attention and shared positive affect, but between-group differences did not reach statistical significance. A significant time effect was found for all outcomes (p < .001); greatest change occurred during the intervention period, particularly in the Interpersonal Synchrony group. This is the first ASD randomized trial involving toddlers to identify an active ingredient for enhancing socially engaged imitation. Adding social engagement targets to intervention improves short-term outcome at no additional cost to the intervention.

At Norrtälje Prison, we approached 315 male inmates for screening of childhood ADHD by the Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS-25) and for present ADHD by the Adult ADHD Self-Report Screener (ASRS-Screener). The response rate was 62%. Further, we assessed 34 inmates for ADHD and coexisting disorders. Finally, we compared findings with 20 adult males with ADHD, assessed at a psychiatric outpatient clinic and 18 healthy controls. The estimated prevalence of adult ADHD among longer-term inmates was 40%. Only 2 out of 30 prison inmates confirmed with ADHD had received a diagnosis of ADHD during childhood, despite most needed health services and educational support. All subjects reported lifetime substance use disorder (SUD) where amphetamine was the most common drug.

Personality disorders were common; almost all inmates presented conduct disorder (CD) before antisocial personality disorder (APD). Prison inmates reported more ADHD symptoms during both childhood and adulthood, compared with ADHD psychiatric outpatients. Further, analysis of executive functions after controlling for IQ showed both ADHD groups performed poorer than controls on working memory tests. Besides, on a continuous performance test, the ADHD prison group displayed poorer results compared with both other groups. This study suggested ADHD to be present among 40% of adult male longer-term prison inmates.

The HMTW intervention was provided over 3.5 months. There were three measurement periods: prior to randomization (Time 1) and at 5 and 9 months post enrollment (Times 2 and 3). Children's communication and parental responsivity were measured at each time point. Children's object interest, a putative moderator, was measured at Time 1. There were no main effects of the HMTW intervention on either parental responsivity or children's communication. However, the effects on residualized gains in parental responsivity from Time 1 to both Times 2 and 3 yielded noteworthy effect sizes (Glass's Δ = .71, .50 respectively). In contrast, there were treatment effects on child communication gains to Time 3 that were moderated by children's Time 1 object interest.

Eleven 5-7 year-old children participated in a CBT-group while parents participated in psychoeducation. Children were randomly assigned to an experimental or delayed-treatment control group. From pre- to post-treatment, all children had less parent reported negativity/lability, better parent reported emotion regulation, and shorter outbursts, and also generated more coping strategies in response to vignettes. Parents also reported increases in their own confidence and their child's ability to deal with anger and anxiety. This study suggests that young children with high functioning ASD may benefit from CBT to improve regulation of anger and anxiety, and parent training may improve parental self-efficacy. Future studies are needed to make conclusions about its efficacy.","Scarpa Angela, Reyes Nuri M","Behavioural and cognitive psychotherapy","Adaptation, Psychological, Anger, Anxiety, Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Child, Preschool, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Combined Modality Therapy, Education, Emotions, Female, Humans, Internal-External Control, Male, Pilot Projects, Psychotherapy, Group, Self Efficacy, Treatment Outcome, United States","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21457605","Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA 24061, USA. ascarpa@vt.edu",

To systematically review evidence regarding such interventions for children aged 12 and younger with ASDs. We searched Medline, PsycINFO, and ERIC (Education Resources Information Center) from 2000 to May 2010. Two reviewers independently assessed studies against predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently extracted data regarding participant and intervention characteristics, assessment techniques, and outcomes and assigned overall quality and strength-of-evidence ratings using predetermined criteria. Thirty-four unique studies met inclusion criteria. Seventeen studies were case series; 2 were randomized controlled trials. We rated 1 study as good quality, 10 as fair quality, and 23 as poor quality. The strength of the evidence overall ranged from insufficient to low. Studies of University of California Los Angeles/Lovaas-based interventions and variants reported clinically significant gains in language and cognitive skills in some children, as did 1 randomized controlled trial of an early intensive developmental intervention approach (the Early Start Denver Model). Specific parent-training approaches yielded gains in short-term language function and some challenging behaviors. Data suggest that subgroups of children displayed more prominent gains across studies, but participant characteristics associated with greater gains are not well understood. Studies of Lovaas-based approaches and early intensive behavioral intervention variants and the Early Start Denver Model resulted in some improvements in cognitive performance, language skills, and adaptive behavior skills in some young children with ASDs, although the literature is limited by methodologic concerns.","Warren Zachary, McPheeters Melissa L, Sathe Nila, Foss-Feig Jennifer H, Glasser Allison, Veenstra-Vanderweele Jeremy","Pediatrics","Behavior Therapy, Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Child, Preschool, Early Diagnosis, Early Intervention, Educational, Female, Humans, Male, Prognosis, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Severity of Illness Index, Treatment Outcome, United States","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21464190","Vanderbilt University, 230 Appleton Place/PMB 74, Nashville, TN 37203-5721, USA. zachary.warren@vanderbilt.edu",

Preliminary evidence showed possible language benefits in autism from the β-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. Earlier studies in other populations suggested propranolol might benefit performance on tasks involving a search of semantic and associative networks under certain conditions. Therefore, we wished to determine whether this benefit of propranolol includes an effect on semantic fluency in autism. A sample of 14 high-functioning adolescent and adult participants with autism and 14 matched controls were given letter and category word fluency tasks on 2 separate testing sessions; 1 test was given 60 minutes after the administration of 40 mg propranolol orally, and 1 test was given after placebo, administered in a double-blinded, counterbalanced manner. Participants with autism were significantly impaired compared with controls on both fluency tasks. Propranolol significantly improved performance on category fluency, but not letter fluency among autism participants. No drug effect was observed among controls. Expected drug effects on heart rate and blood pressure were observed in both the groups. Results are consistent with a selective beneficial effect of propranolol on flexibility of access to semantic and associative networks in autism, with no observed effect on phonological networks.

In ASP participants, naming improved after rTMS of the left pars triangularis as compared with sham stimulation, whereas rTMS of the adjacent left opercularis lengthened naming latency. In healthy subjects, stimulation of parts of Broca's area did not lead to significant changes in naming skills, consistent with published data.

Individuals with FXS, males in particular, often exhibit extreme eye gaze avoidance and hyperarousal when they encounter stressful social situations. We investigated whether oxytocin (OT), a hormone with prosocial and anxiolytic effects, could alleviate symptoms of social anxiety in this population. A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled single-dose trial was performed with intranasal administration of placebo, 24 IU OT and 48 IU OT. Measures of eye gaze frequency, heart rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), heart rate variability (HRV) and salivary cortisol were obtained during a structured social challenge conducted 50 min following OT administration. Ten low-functioning males with FXS (aged 13-28 years) traveled to Stanford for the initial visit: 8 completed the study. Eye gaze frequency improved significantly in response to the 24 IU OT dose and salivary cortisol levels decreased significantly in response to the 48 IU OT dose. There was no effect of OT on heart rate, RSA or HRV although individual plots of the heart rate data suggested that OT increased heart rate in some participants and decreased heart rate in others. These findings suggest that intranasal administration of OT may ameliorate some symptoms of social anxiety in patients with FXS.

ACRT, IQ and biochemical measures were taken after 5 months placebo and 5 months fenfluramine treatment. After fenfluramine treatment blood serotonin levels fell, urinary catecholamine levels fell and the HVA/DA ratio rose. IQ and ACRT performance improved. On the ACRT subjects were asked to press a button to a rare target (500 Hz, P = 0.14) and to ignore higher pitched rare (2,000 Hz, P = 0.14) and frequent non-targets (1,000 Hz). After fenfluramine treatment N1 latencies increased. The scalp distribution of ERP maxima changes slightly with treatment. P3 maxima elicited by rare non-targets were recorded more rostrally after fenfluramine treatment. After rare non-targets N1 amplitudes at Fz decreased but P3 amplitudes at Pz increased. Early negativity after the rare non-target (particularly on the right side) was negatively correlated with the HVA/DA ratio. Subtraction of the P3 component elicited in a passive condition where no response was required from the active condition showed that P3 positivity to targets was halved with treatment. (In contrast Nd increased on fenfluramine treatment). Overall, N1 and P3 components showed greatest responsiveness to rare non-targets on fenfluramine. N1 but not P3 changes may represent slight improvement of attention-related function with treatment. Small changes in ERP latency and distribution, associated with the neuroleptic action of fenfluramine may be partly responsible for a mild improvement of IQ and ACRT performance on medication.","Oades R D, Stern L M, Walker M K, Clark C R, Kapoor V","International journal of psychophysiology : official journal of the International Organization of Psychophysiology","Adolescent, Attention, Autistic Disorder, Biogenic Monoamines, Child, Double-Blind Method, Electroencephalography, Evoked Potentials, Female, Fenfluramine, Homovanillic Acid, Humans, Intelligence Tests, Male, Neuropsychological Tests, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Reaction Time","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2187009","Department of Physiology, Flinders Medical Centre, Bedford Park, Australia.",

Here we asked whether risperidone-associated improvement was related to changes in concentrations of inflammatory molecules in the serum of these subjects. Seven molecules were identified as worthy of further assessment by performing a pilot analysis of 31 inflammatory markers in 21 medication-free subjects with autism versus 15 healthy controls: epidermal growth factor (EGF), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin (IL)-13, IL-17, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), IL-1 and IL-1-receptor antagonist. Serum concentrations of these markers were then established in a different set of subjects that participated in a double-blind, clinical trial and an expanded group of healthy subjects. In the first analysis, samples obtained from subjects with autism at baseline visits were compared to visits after 8-week treatment with placebo (n=37) or risperidone (n=40). The cytokine concentrations remained stable over the 8-week period for both risperidone and placebo groups. In the second analysis, we explored further the differences between medication-free subjects with autism (n=77) and healthy controls (recruited independently; n=19). Serum levels of EGF were elevated in subjects with autism (median=103 pg/mL, n=75) in comparison to healthy controls (75 pg/mL, n=19; p<0.05), and levels of IL-13 were decreased in autism (median=0.8 pg/mL, n=77) in comparison to controls (9.8 pg/mL, n=19; p=0.0003). These changes did not correlate with standardized measures used for a diagnosis of autism.

Following phase 1, in which 96 patients received aripiprazole, 30 patients (mean age = 7.1 years) were randomly assigned to continue aripiprazole and 30 patients (mean age = 6.7 years) were randomly assigned to placebo. The mean (SD) dose of aripiprazole prior to randomization for these patients was 6.4 (2.1) mg/d. Patients randomly assigned to aripiprazole were enrolled significantly longer until time to study discontinuation due to a mood event (6.14 median weeks, SE ± 11.88 weeks; P = .005) and discontinuation for any reason (including mood events) (4.00 median weeks, SE ± 3.91 weeks; P = .003) than those randomly assigned to placebo (mood event, 2.29 median weeks, SE ± 0.38 weeks; any reason, 2.00 median weeks, SE ± 0.31 weeks). Regardless of random assignment, both the aripiprazole and placebo groups showed substantial rates of withdrawal from maintenance treatment over the initial 4 weeks (15/30 [50%] for aripiprazole; 27/30 [90%] for placebo), suggesting a possible nocebo effect (ie, knowledge of possibly switching from active medication to placebo increasing concern about relapse). The most frequently reported adverse events during double-blind aripiprazole therapy included stomach pain (n = 10, 33%), increased appetite (n = 9, 30%), and headaches (n = 9, 30%). Despite the possibility of a nocebo effect, these results suggest that aripiprazole may be superior to placebo in the long-term treatment of pediatric patients following stabilization with open-label aripiprazole. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00194077.","Findling Robert L, Youngstrom Eric A, McNamara Nora K, Stansbrey Robert J, Wynbrandt Jaime L, Adegbite Clara, Rowles Brieana M, Demeter Christine A, Frazier Thomas W, Calabrese Joseph R","The Journal of clinical psychiatry","Antipsychotic Agents, Aripiprazole, Bipolar Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Piperazines, Quinolones","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22152402","Department of Psychiatry, University Hospitals, Case Medical Center, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA. robert.findling@uhhospitals.org",

Adults with ASDs were enrolled in a 12-week double-blind placebo-controlled fluoxetine trial. Thirty-seven were randomly assigned to fluoxetine (N=22) or placebo (N=15). Dosage followed a fixed schedule, starting at 10 mg/day and increasing as tolerated up to 80 mg/day. Repetitive behaviors were measured with the compulsion subscale of the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale; the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) improvement scale was used to rate improvement in obsessive-compulsive symptoms and overall severity. There was a significant treatment-by-time interaction indicating a significantly greater reduction in repetitive behaviors across time for fluoxetine than for placebo. With overall response defined as a CGI global improvement score of 2 or less, there were significantly more responders at week 12 in the fluoxetine group than in the placebo group. The risk ratio was 1.5 for CGI global improvement (responders: fluoxetine, 35%; placebo, 0%) and 1.8 for CGI-rated improvement in obsessive-compulsive symptoms (responders: fluoxetine, 50%; placebo, 8%).

Many children actually show a decline in adaptive skills compared with age mates over time. This 24-week, three-site, controlled clinical trial randomized 124 children (4 through 13 years of age) with PDDs and serious behavioral problems to medication alone (MED; n = 49; risperidone 0.5 to 3.5 mg/day; if ineffective, switch to aripiprazole was permitted) or a combination of medication plus parent training (PT) (COMB; n = 75). Parents of children in COMB received an average of 11.4 PT sessions. Standard scores and Age-Equivalent scores on Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales were the outcome measures of primary interest. Seventeen subjects did not have a post-randomization Vineland assessment. Thus, we used a mixed model with outcome conditioned on the baseline Vineland scores. Both groups showed improvement over the 24-week trial on all Vineland domains. Compared with MED, Vineland Socialization and Adaptive Composite Standard scores showed greater improvement in the COMB group (p = .01 and .05, and effect sizes = 0.35 and 0.22, respectively). On Age Equivalent scores, Socialization and Communication domains showed greater improvement in COMB versus MED (p = .03 and 0.05, and effect sizes = 0.33 and 0.14, respectively). Using logistic regression, children in the COMB group were twice as likely to make at least 6 months' gain (equal to the passage of time) in the Vineland Communication Age Equivalent score compared with MED (p = .02). After controlling for IQ, this difference was no longer significant. Reduction of serious maladaptive behavior promotes improvement in adaptive behavior.

These effects are probably mediated by genetic variations within the OT system. One potential candidate could be the CD38 gene, which codes for a transmembrane protein engaged in OT secretion processes. A common variation in this gene (rs3796863) was recently found to be associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Using an imaging genetics approach, we studied differential effects of an intranasal OT application on neural processing of social stimuli in 55 healthy young men depending on their CD38 gene variant in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design. Genotype had a significant influence on both behavioral and neuronal measures of social processing. Homozygotic risk allele carriers showed slower reaction times (RT) and higher activation of left fusiform gyrus during visual processing of social stimuli. Under OT activation differences between genotypes were more evident (though not statistically significantly increased) and RT were accelerated in homozygotic risk allele carriers. According to our data, rs3796863 mainly influences fusiform gyrus activation, an area which has been widely discussed in ASD research. OT seems to modulate this effect by enhancing activation differences between allele groups, which suggests an interaction between genetic makeup and OT availability on fusiform gyrus activation. These results support recent approaches to apply OT as a pharmacological treatment of ASD symptoms.","Sauer Carina, Montag Christian, Wörner Christiane, Kirsch Peter, Reuter Martin","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Administration, Intranasal, Adult, Affect, Arousal, Attention, Autistic Disorder, Brain, Brain Mapping, Cross-Over Studies, Follow-Up Studies, Genetic Variation, Genotype, Humans, Image Processing, Computer-Assisted, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Oxygen, Oxytocin, Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1, Reaction Time, Social Perception, Surveys and Questionnaires, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22278094","Department of Clinical Psychology, Central Institute of Mental Health, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.

Several reports indicate that children with ASD show reduced error processing and deficient behavioral correction after an error is committed. Error sensitivity can be readily examined by measuring event-related potentials (ERP) associated with responses to errors, the fronto-central error-related negativity (ERN), and the error-related positivity (Pe). The goal of our study was to investigate whether reaction time (RT), error rate, post-error RT change, ERN, and Pe will show positive changes following 12-week long slow frequency repetitive TMS (rTMS) over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in high functioning children with ASD. We hypothesized that 12 sessions of 1 Hz rTMS bilaterally applied over the DLPFC will result in improvements reflected in both behavioral and ERP measures. Participants were randomly assigned to either active rTMS treatment or wait-list (WTL) groups. Baseline and post-TMS/or WTL EEG was collected using 128 channel EEG system. The task involved the recognition of a specific illusory shape, in this case a square or triangle, created by three or four inducer disks. ERN in TMS treatment group became significantly more negative. The number of omission errors decreased post-TMS. The RT did not change, but post-error RT became slower. There were no changes in RT, error rate, post-error RT slowing, nor in ERN/Pe measures in the wait-list group. Our results show significant post-TMS differences in the response-locked ERP such as ERN, as well as behavioral response monitoring measures indicative of improved error monitoring and correction function. The ERN and Pe, along with behavioral performance measures, can be used as functional outcome measures to assess the effectiveness of neuromodulation (e.g., rTMS) in children with autism and thus may have important practical implications.","Sokhadze Estate M, Baruth Joshua M, Sears Lonnie, Sokhadze Guela E, El-Baz Ayman S, Casanova Manuel F","Applied psychophysiology and biofeedback","Adolescent, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child Behavior, Data Interpretation, Statistical, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Electroencephalography, Electrooculography, Evoked Potentials, Female, Humans, Intelligence Tests, Male, Neuropsychological Tests, Prefrontal Cortex, Psychomotor Performance, Reaction Time, Self Concept, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22311204","Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Louisville School of Medicine, KY 40202, USA. tato.sokhadze@louisville.edu",

However, public debate over the safety of the trivalent MMR vaccine and the resultant drop in vaccination coverage in several countries persists, despite its almost universal use and accepted effectiveness. To assess the effectiveness and adverse effects associated with the MMR vaccine in children up to 15 years of age. For this update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, PubMed (July 2004 to May week 2, 2011) and Embase.com (July 2004 to May 2011). We used comparative prospective or retrospective trials assessing the effects of the MMR vaccine compared to placebo, do nothing or a combination of measles, mumps and rubella antigens on healthy individuals up to 15 years of age. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality of the included studies. One review author arbitrated in case of disagreement. We included five randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one controlled clinical trial (CCT), 27 cohort studies, 17 case-control studies, five time-series trials, one case cross-over trial, two ecological studies, six self controlled case series studies involving in all about 14,700,000 children and assessing effectiveness and safety of MMR vaccine. Based on the available evidence, one MMR vaccine dose is at least 95% effective in preventing clinical measles and 92% effective in preventing secondary cases among household contacts.Effectiveness of at least one dose of MMR in preventing clinical mumps in children is estimated to be between 69% and 81% for the vaccine prepared with Jeryl Lynn mumps strain and between 70% and 75% for the vaccine containing the Urabe strain. Vaccination with MMR containing the Urabe strain has demonstrated to be 73% effective in preventing secondary mumps cases. Effectiveness of Jeryl Lynn containing MMR in preventing laboratory-confirmed mumps cases in children and adolescents was estimated to be between 64% to 66% for one dose and 83% to 88% for two vaccine doses. We did not identify any studies assessing the effectiveness of MMR in preventing rubella.The highest risk of association with aseptic meningitis was observed within the third week after immunisation with Urabe-containing MMR (risk ratio (RR) 14.28; 95% confidence interval (CI) from 7.93 to 25.71) and within the third (RR 22.5; 95% CI 11.8 to 42.9) or fifth (RR 15.6; 95% CI 10.3 to 24.2) weeks after immunisation with the vaccine prepared with the Leningrad-Zagreb strain. A significant risk of association with febrile seizures and MMR exposure during the two previous weeks (RR 1.10; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.15) was assessed in one large person-time cohort study involving 537,171 children aged between three months and five year of age. Increased risk of febrile seizure has also been observed in children aged between 12 to 23 months (relative incidence (RI) 4.09; 95% CI 3.1 to 5.33) and children aged 12 to 35 months (RI 5.68; 95% CI 2.31 to 13.97) within six to 11 days after exposure to MMR vaccine. An increased risk of thrombocytopenic purpura within six weeks after MMR immunisation in children aged 12 to 23 months was assessed in one case-control study (RR 6.3; 95% CI 1.3 to 30.1) and in one small self controlled case series (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 5.38; 95% CI 2.72 to 10.62). Increased risk of thrombocytopenic purpura within six weeks after MMR exposure was also assessed in one other case-control study involving 2311 children and adolescents between one month and 18 years (odds ratio (OR) 2.4; 95% CI 1.2 to 4.7). Exposure to the MMR vaccine was unlikely to be associated with autism, asthma, leukaemia, hay fever, type 1 diabetes, gait disturbance, Crohn's disease, demyelinating diseases, bacterial or viral infections. The design and reporting of safety outcomes in MMR vaccine studies, both pre- and post-marketing, are largely inadequate.

Milieu teaching and the combined intervention produced higher rates of language targets than did responsive interaction. An analysis of the type and function of language targets suggested that differences between conditions were driven primarily by prompted-and, to a lesser extent, spontaneous-requests. Social engagement ratings were higher during each intervention than at baseline, but differences between treatment conditions were not consistent across children. For children with autism, naturalistic interventions that use direct elicitation of child language lead to greater short-term gains in the use of expressive language targets-in particular, prompted requests-than interventions that use facilitative strategies only. All 3 naturalistic language interventions can promote social engagement.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids arachidonic acid (ARA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may have key role in brain network maturation. In particularly, ARA is important in signal transduction related to neuronal maturation. Supplementation with larger ARA doses added to DHA may therefore mitigate social impairment. In a 16-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we evaluated the efficacy of supplementation with large doses of ARA added to DHA (n = 7) or placebo (n = 6) in 13 participants (mean age, 14.6 [SD, 5.9] years). To examine underlying mechanisms underlying the effect of our supplementation regimen, we examined plasma levels of antioxidants transferrin and superoxide dismutase, which are useful markers of signal transduction. The outcome measures were the Social Responsiveness Scale and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community. Repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed that our supplementation regimen significantly improved Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community-measured social withdrawal and Social Responsiveness Scale-measured communication. Treatment effect sizes were more favorable for the treatment group compared with the placebo group (communication: treatment groups, 0.87 vs, placebo, 0.44; social withdrawal: treatment groups, 0.88, vs placebo, 0.54). There was a significant difference in the change in plasma transferrin levels and a trend toward a significant difference in the change in plasma superoxide dismutase levels between the 2 groups.

The present study examined the effects of pharmacological modulation of the norepinephrine system on the severity of such impairments. A sample of 14 high-functioning adults with ASD and a demographically-matched comparison group of 13 typically developing individuals participated. An AX continuous performance test (AX-CPT) was used to evaluate working memory and inhibitory control. AX-CPT performance was assessed following administration of a single dose of propranolol (a beta adrenergic antagonist) and following placebo (sugar pill) administration. Individuals with ASD performed more poorly than non-ASD individuals in the working memory condition (BX trials). Importantly, administration of propranolol attenuated this impairment, with the ASD group performing significantly better in the propranolol condition than the placebo condition. Working memory performance of the non-ASD group was unaffected by propranolol/placebo administration. No group or medication effects were observed for the inhibition condition (AY trials). The present findings suggest that norepinephrine may play a role in some, but not necessarily all, cognitive impairments associated with ASD. Additional research is needed to fully understand whether this role is primarily causal or compensatory in nature.","Bodner Kimberly E, Beversdorf David Q, Saklayen Sanjida S, Christ Shawn E","Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS","Adolescent, Adrenergic beta-Antagonists, Adult, Attention, Case-Control Studies, Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Inhibition, Psychological, Male, Memory Disorders, Memory, Short-Term, Neuropsychological Tests, Propranolol, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22414705","Department of Psychological Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri 65203, USA.",

Mecamylamine, because of its safety record in children with other disorders, was chosen for this first exploration. Twenty children with autism spectrum disorder age 4-12 years were randomly assigned for 14 weeks to placebo (n=8) or mecamylamine (n=12) in ascending fixed doses: 0.5 mg/day for 6 weeks, 2.5 mg for 2 weeks, then 5 mg/day for 6 weeks. Improvement was rated by a blinded independent evaluator. Because of small sample, data analysis was descriptive. Eighteen participants (10 mecamylamine, 8 placebo) completed the study. All doses were well tolerated; the only side effect of note was constipation (50% compared with 25% of placebo group). Three children had clinically nonsignificant electrocardiographic QT prolongation. Both groups showed modest to moderate improvement, but differences between groups were negligible. On the primary outcome measure, the Ohio Autism Clinical Impressions Scale, 90% of the active treatment group showed improvement at some point (but only 40% sustained it), compared with 62% on placebo. Of the four in active treatment that sustained improvement, three had a maximum dose of 0.13-0.15 mg/kg/day, while those who regressed had doses ≥0.18 mg/kg/day. Graphed means suggested better outcome with lower mg/kg and longer medication duration. Four parents spontaneously reported reduced hyperactivity and irritability and better verbalization and continued mecamylamine at their own expense.

A LITERATURE REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED USING THE MEDLINE SEARCH TERMS: 'autism' OR 'autism spectrum disorder' with the following limits: Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), human trials, English language. Additional articles were identified from reference information. Trials involving nutritional supplements, hormones or drugs not approved by either Health Canada or the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were excluded from analysis. Twenty-three RCTs that met criteria were identified. The greatest number of RCTs involved risperidone, with six of seven placebo-controlled risperidone trials reporting statistically significant improvements on the primary outcome measure. Two aripiprazole RCTs and one olanzapine RCT reported statistically significant improvement in primary outcome measures. Haloperidol was superior to both clomipramine and placebo in a head-to-head crossover trial, while risperidone was superior to haloperidol for treatment of behavioural symptoms in a separate head-to-head trial. Clonidine, methylphenidate, valproate and levocarnitine monotherapy were superior to placebo in single RCTs, while adjunctive treatments cyproheptadine, pentoxifylline and topiramate were superior to placebo in small studies when given in combination with an antipsychotic. Adverse events from RCTs were summarized, including weight gain and metabolic effects, if available. The bulk of positive RCT evidence for the pharmacotherapy of irritability of autism pertains to FDA approved antipsychotics risperidone and aripiprazole. RCTs supporting efficacy of several alternative and adjunctive agents may afford additional treatment options when optimal antipsychotic doses fail to control symptoms or cause intolerable adverse effects.

The active treatment groups all resulted in improvements across all outcome measures, with moderate-to-large effect sizes from baseline to a 12-week assessment. Melatonin treatment was mainly effective in reducing insomnia symptoms, while cognitive-behavioural therapy had a light positive impact mainly on sleep latency, suggesting that some behavioural aspects might play a role in determining initial insomnia.

Social skills groups are a common intervention for individuals with ASD. Although a frequently recommended practice, the few studies that have addressed the efficacy of social skills groups have shown mixed results. To determine the effectiveness of social skills groups for improving social competence, social communication, and quality of life for people with ASD who are six to 21 years of age. We searched the following databases in December 2011: CENTRAL (2011 Issue 4), MEDLINE (1948 to November Week 3, 2011), EMBASE (1980 to Week 50, 2011), PsycINFO (1887 to December Week 2, 2011), CINAHL (1937 to current), ERIC (1966 to current), Sociological Abstracts (1952 to current), OCLC WorldCat (12 December 2011), Social Science Citation Index (1970 to 16 December 2011), and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (20 December 2011). We also searched the reference lists of published papers. Randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing treatment (social skills groups) with a control group who were not receiving the treatment for participants aged six to 21 years with ASD. The control group could be no intervention, wait list, or treatment as usual. Outcomes sought were standardized measures of social competence, social communication, quality of life, emotion recognition, and any other specific behaviors. Two review authors independently selected and appraised studies for inclusion and assessed the risk of bias in each included study. All outcome data were continuous and standardized mean difference effect sizes (ES) with small sample correction were calculated. We conducted random-effects meta-analysis where possible. We included five RCTs evaluating the effects of social skills groups in 196 participants with ASD aged 6 to 21 years old. The results show there is some evidence that social skills groups improve overall social competence (ES = 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.78, P = 0.003) and friendship quality (ES = 0.41, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.81, P = 0.04) for this population. No differences were found between treatment and control groups in relation to emotional recognition (ES = 0.34, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.88, P = 0.21) assessed in two studies or social communication as related to the understanding of idioms (ES = 0.05, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.72, P = 0.89), which was assessed in only one study. Two additional quality of life outcomes were evaluated, with results of single studies suggesting decreases in loneliness (ES = -0.66, 95% CI -1.15 to -0.17) but no effect on child or parental depression. No adverse events were reported.Given the nature of the intervention and the selected outcome measures, the risk of performance and detection bias are high. There is limited generalizability from the studies as they were all conducted in the US; they focused mainly on children aged 7 to 12, and the participants were all of average or above average intelligence. There is some evidence that social skills groups can improve social competence for some children and adolescents with ASD. More research is needed to draw more robust conclusions, especially with respect to improvements in quality of life.","Reichow Brian, Steiner Amanda M, Volkmar Fred","The Cochrane database of systematic reviews","Adolescent, Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Emotional Intelligence, Humans, Psychotherapy, Group, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Reinforcement, Social, Social Facilitation, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22786515","Child Study Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA. brian.reichow@yale.edu.",

In mammals, social participation originates within the parent-infant bond and is supported by the oxytocin (OT) system, whose functioning is transmitted from parent to child through patterns of parental care. Human studies indicate that OT administration increases affiliative behavior, including trust, empathy, and social reciprocity. Here, we examine whether OT administration to parent can enhance physiological and behavioral processes that support parental social engagement but, moreover, can have parallel effects on the infant. Utilizing a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, 35 fathers and their 5-month-old infants were observed twice following administration of OT or placebo to father in the face-to-face still-face paradigm. Parent and infant salivary OT were assessed at multiple time points, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was measured in the three face-to-face still-face episodes, and social behaviors of the parent and child were micro-coded for indices of social engagement. Oxytocin administration increased father salivary OT, RSA during free play, and key parenting behaviors that support parental-infant bonding. Parallel increases were also found in the infant's salivary OT, RSA response, and engagement behavior, including social gaze, exploration, and social reciprocity. Results are the first to demonstrate that OT administration to one attachment partner can have parallel effects on the other and underscore the role of OT in the cross-generation transmission of human social participation. Findings have translational implications for conditions associated with early risk for social-emotional growth, including autism and prematurity, without the need to administer drugs to young infants.","Weisman Omri, Zagoory-Sharon Orna, Feldman Ruth","Biological psychiatry","Adult, Arrhythmia, Sinus, Autonomic Nervous System, Child Development, Double-Blind Method, Electrocardiography, Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, Fathers, Female, Humans, Infant, Infant Behavior, Interpersonal Relations, Male, Object Attachment, Oxytocin, Parent-Child Relations, Postpartum Period, Saliva, Social Behavior, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22795645","Department of Psychology and the Gonda Brain Sciences Center, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel.",

Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic approved for pediatric use in schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder, and autistic disorder. Adult studies have evaluated aripiprazole's effects on electrocardiograms, but no pediatric studies have been published to date. Electrocardiographic data were collected from children and adolescents participating in a 14-week, prospective, open-label study (n=25) of aripiprazole for irritability in pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified and Asperger's disorder. A 12-lead electrocardiogram was obtained at the baseline and end point visits. The electrocardiograms were evaluated for abnormal findings, and the PR, QRS, QT(c), and RR intervals were recorded. The QT interval was corrected using Bazett's, United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Pharmacology Division, and Fridericia's formulas. Twenty-four subjects received both baseline and posttreatment electrocardiograms. The mean age was 8.6 years (range 5-17 years). The average final aripiprazole dose was 7.8 mg/day (range 2.5-15 mg/day). There were no significant differences noted with the PR, QRS, RR, and QT(c) intervals after aripiprazole therapy. Also, there was no significant correlation between the dose given and the percent change in the QT(c). No post-treatment QT(c) exceeded 440 ms. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic evaluation of the cardiac effects of aripiprazole in children and adolescents. The results are consistent with previously published literature in adults that aripiprazole has no significant cardiac effects and can be deemed a low risk for causing sudden death. It will be important to confirm these findings in a randomized controlled trial.","Ho Jason G, Caldwell Randall L, McDougle Christopher J, Orsagh-Yentis Danielle K, Erickson Craig A, Posey David J, Stigler Kimberly A","Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology","Adolescent, Antipsychotic Agents, Aripiprazole, Asperger Syndrome, Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Child, Preschool, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Electrocardiography, Female, Humans, Irritable Mood, Male, Pilot Projects, Piperazines, Prospective Studies, Quinolones","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22849533","Section of Pediatric Cardiology, Department of Pediatrics, James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202-5200, USA.",

To overcome these methodological shortcomings, this study evaluated the effects of EEG-biofeedback in ASD in a randomized pretest-posttest control group design with blinded active comparator and six months follow-up. Thirty-eight participants were randomly allocated to the EEG-biofeedback, skin conductance (SC)-biofeedback or waiting list group. EEG- and SC-biofeedback sessions were similar and participants were blinded to the type of feedback they received. Assessments pre-treatment, post-treatment, and after 6 months included parent ratings of symptoms of ASD, executive function tasks, and 19-channel EEG recordings. Fifty-four percent of the participants significantly reduced delta and/or theta power during EEG-biofeedback sessions and were identified as EEG-regulators. In these EEG-regulators, no statistically significant reductions of symptoms of ASD were observed, but they showed significant improvement in cognitive flexibility as compared to participants who managed to regulate SC. EEG-biofeedback seems to be an applicable tool to regulate EEG activity and has specific effects on cognitive flexibility, but it did not result in significant reductions in symptoms of ASD.

Twenty-one healthy participants received functional MRI scans while completing an empathic accuracy task, the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), both prior to and after completion of either CBCT or a health discussion control group. Upon completion of the study interventions, participants randomized to CBCT and were significantly more likely than control subjects to have increased scores on the RMET and increased neural activity in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC).

It is also associated with ritualistic and stereotypical behaviour. Recent studies propose both hyper-and hypoglutamatergic ideologies for autism. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of memantine plus risperidone in the treatment of children with autism. Children with autism were randomly allocated to risperidone plus memantine or placebo plus risperidone for a 10-wk, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The dose of risperidone was titrated up to 3 mg/d and memantine was titrated to 20 mg/d. Children were assessed at baseline and after 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 wk of starting medication protocol. The primary outcome measure was the irritability subscale of Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C). Difference between the two treatment arms was significant as the group that received memantine had greater reduction in ABC-C subscale scores for irritability, stereotypic behaviour and hyperactivity. Eight side-effects were observed over the trial, out of the 25 side-effects that the checklist included. The difference between the two groups in the frequency of side-effects was not significant. The present study suggests that memantine may be a potential adjunctive treatment strategy for autism and it was generally well tolerated.

A randomized controlled trial involving 98 children and families was carried out in three different sites investigating the efficacy of a parent delivery of the Early Start Denver model (P-ESDM), which fosters parental use of a child-centered responsive interaction style that embeds many teaching opportunities into play, compared to community treatment as usual. Assessments were completed at baseline and 12 weeks later, immediately after the end of parent coaching sessions. There was no effect of group assignment on parent-child interaction characteristics or on any child outcomes. Both groups of parents improved interaction skills, and both groups of children demonstrated progress. Parents receiving P-ESDM demonstrated significantly stronger working alliances with their therapists than did the community group. Children in the community group received significantly more intervention hours than those in the P-ESDM group. For the group as a whole, both younger child age at the start of intervention and a greater number of intervention hours were positively related to the degree of improvement in children's behavior for most variables. Parent-implemented intervention studies for early ASD thus far have not demonstrated the large effects seen in intensive-treatment studies. Evidence that both younger age and more intervention hours positively affect developmental rates has implications for clinical practice, service delivery, and public policy.","Rogers Sally J, Estes Annette, Lord Catherine, Vismara Laurie, Winter Jamie, Fitzpatrick Annette, Guo Mengye, Dawson Geraldine","Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry","Adult, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Child, Preschool, Early Intervention, Educational, Family Therapy, Female, Humans, Infant, Male, Models, Psychological, Parent-Child Relations, Parents, Risk, Time Factors","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23021480","University of California-Davis (UC Davis) Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders Institute, Sacramento 95817, USA. sally.rogers@ucdmc.ucdavis.edu",

A total of 140 postmenopausal osteoporotic women were randomized to receive either ALN or ALN plus 25OHD(3) (ALN+VitD) over a 3-month period. Serum 25OHD, PTH, C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX), and amino-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (P1NP) were measured at baseline and at the end of the 3 months. 25OHD rose four times above baseline levels in the ALN+VitD group, whereas no changes were seen in the ALN group. Administering ALN resulted in a significant decline in both serum CTX (53 ± 24%) and P1NP (46 ± 19%). After ALN+VitD, the fall in CTX amounted to 61 ± 20% (P = 0.06 compared with ALN) and P1NP to 50 ± 23% (P = 0.35). When patients were divided into those below and above 20 ng/ml of baseline serum 25OHD, in those below, CTX decreased by 48 ± 26% in the ALN group and by 61 ± 17% in the ALN+VitD group (P = 0.015). For P1NP, the corresponding figures were 43 ± 20 and 50 ± 23% (P = 0.2). In patients above 20 ng/ml, no differences were seen regarding CTX (58 ± 21% decrease in the ALN group and 60 ± 23% in the ALN+VitD group; P = 0.7) or P1NP (49 ± 18 and 50 ± 20%; P = 0.9). Administration of 25OHD(3) is not an indispensable requirement for bisphosphonates to develop their bone antiresorptive effect. In fact, in patients with vitamin D sufficiency, no benefit is observed when the vitamin is added.

This was a post-hoc analysis of data from a 4-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate which informants detect response to treatment with aripiprazole in pediatric subjects experiencing a mixed or manic episode associated with bipolar I disorder. Efficacy assessments included clinician-rated scales and the parent- and subject-rated 10-item General Behavior Inventory Mania (GBI-M10) and Depression (GBI-D10) scales. Cohen's d quantified effect sizes for total scale scores and individual line items. Parent-GBI-M10 total, clinician-rated Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total, and Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar Disorder (CGI-BP) Mania scores produced similar effect sizes, suggesting that the parent-GBI-M10 is sensitive to treatment-related improvements in manic symptoms. Aripiprazole improved a broad spectrum of parent-rated mania symptoms; six parent-GBI-M10 line item effect sizes were moderate (>0.5) in at least one of the two aripiprazole treatment arms (10 or 30 mg/day). Subject-completed GBI-M10 line item effect sizes were consistently smaller, indicating that the subjects' experience of treatment effects were less pronounced. Study inclusion/exclusion criteria may limit generalizability of these findings.

At present, there are no curative or psychopharmacological therapies to effectively treat all symptoms of the disorder. Early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI), a treatment based on the principles of applied behavior analysis delivered for multiple years at an intensity of 20 to 40 hours per week, is one of the more well-established treatments for ASD. To systematically review the evidence for the effectiveness of EIBI in increasing the functional behaviors and skills of young children with ASD. We searched the following databases on 22 November 2011: CENTRAL (2011 Issue 4), MEDLINE (1948 to November Week 2, 2011), EMBASE (1980 to Week 46, 2011), PsycINFO (1806 to November Week 3, 2011), CINAHL (1937 to current), ERIC (1966 to current), Sociological Abstracts (1952 to current), Social Science Citation Index (1970 to current), WorldCat, metaRegister of Controlled Trials, and Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations. We also searched the reference lists of published papers. Randomized control trials (RCTs), quasi-randomized control trials, or clinical control trials (CCTs) in which EIBI was compared to a no-treatment or treatment-as-usual control condition. Participants must have been less than six years of age at treatment onset and assigned to their study condition prior to commencing treatment. Two authors independently selected and appraised studies for inclusion and assessed the risk of bias in each included study. All outcome data were continuous, from which standardized mean difference effect sizes with small sample correction were calculated. We conducted random-effects meta-analysis where possible, which means we assumed individual studies would provide different estimates of treatment effects. One RCT and four CCTs with a total of 203 participants were included. Reliance on synthesis from four CCTs limits the evidential base and this should be borne in mind when interpreting the results. All studies used a treatment-as-usual comparison group. We synthesized the results of the four CCTs using a random-effects model of meta-analysis of the standardized mean differences. Positive effects in favor of the EIBI treatment group were found for all outcomes. The mean effect size for adaptive behavior was g = 0.69 (95% CI 0.38 to 1.01; P < 0.0001). The mean effect size for IQ was g = 0.76 (95% CI 0.40 to 1.11; P < 0.0001). Three measures of communication and language skills all showed results in favor of EIBI: expressive language g = 0.50 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.95; P = 0.03), receptive language g = 0.57 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.94; P = .03), and daily communication skills g = 0.74 (95% CI 0.30 to 1.18; P = 0.0009). The mean effect size for socialization was g = 0.42 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.73; P = 0.0008), and for daily living skills was g = 0.55 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.87; P = 0.0005). Additional descriptive analyses of other aspects related to quality of life and psychopathology are presented. However, due to the inclusion of non-randomized studies, there is a high risk of bias and the overall quality of evidence was rated as 'low' using the GRADE system, which rates the quality of evidence from meta-analyses to determine recommendations for practice. There is some evidence that EIBI is an effective behavioral treatment for some children with ASD. However, the current state of the evidence is limited because of the reliance on data from non-randomized studies (CCTs) due to the lack of RCTs. Additional studies using RCT research designs are needed to make stronger conclusions about the effects of EIBI for children with ASD.","Reichow Brian, Barton Erin E, Boyd Brian A, Hume Kara","The Cochrane database of systematic reviews","Behavior Therapy, Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic, Early Intervention, Educational, Early Medical Intervention, Humans","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23076956","Child Study Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA. brian.reichow@yale.edu.",

A live adjuvant Salmonella Gallinarum (SG) strain was generated in the present study to facilitate efficacious oral vaccination with this vaccine. The Escherichia coli eltB gene secreting heat-labile enterotoxin B subunit (LTB) was cloned into an Asd(+) plasmid pJHL65. This was transformed into a Δlon ΔcpxR Δasd SG strain and the resulting strain was designated JOL1229. Secretion of LTB from JOL1229 was confirmed with an immunoblot assay. To determine the optimal dose of the strain, 50 six-week-old female chickens were divided into five groups (Groups A-E, n=10 per group) and orally inoculated with various doses of JOL1229 and JOL916. In Group B (consisting of four parts JOL916 and one part JOL1229), significant cell-mediated immune responses, plasma IgG levels and intestinal secretary IgA levels were induced after inoculation with both strains. On challenge with the wild-type strain, significant reductions in mortality were observed in the group. In addition, after inoculation the LTB strain was not recovered in feces samples, and resulted in no, or very mild, gross lesions in the liver and spleen. Both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells were significantly increased in peripheral blood samples from the chickens immunized with the LTB strain. Expression of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene in splenocytes was induced in the chickens immunized with the LTB strain. These results suggest that oral immunization with the LTB-adjuvant strain, in particular with the four parts JOL916 and one part JOL1229 mixture, increased the immune response and provided efficient protection against FT in chickens.","Jeon Byung Woo, Jawale Chetan V, Kim Seung Hwan, Lee John Hwa","Veterinary immunology and immunopathology","Administration, Oral, Animals, Bacterial Toxins, Bacterial Vaccines, Chickens, Enterotoxins, Escherichia coli Proteins, Feces, Female, Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial, Interleukin-6, Plasmids, Poultry Diseases, RNA, Messenger, Salmonella, Salmonella Infections, Animal","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23083937","College of Veterinary Medicine, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju 561-756, Republic of Korea.",

Although many of these medications have been demonstrated to be useful, no clear primary treatment for PDD-NOS and Asperger's disorder has emerged. Despite the efficacy of some of the medicines, the acceptability and side effects have proven to be barriers to their use. Recent studies indicate that the traditional Japanese herbal medicine yokukansan (TJ-54) may be safe and useful in treating behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia and some neuropsychiatric disorders. We aimed at evaluating both the efficacy and safety of TJ-54 in patients with well-defined PDD-NOS and Asperger's disorder. This was a 12-week prospective, open-label investigation of TJ-54 in 40 children, adolescents, and adults diagnosed with PDD-NOS or Asperger's disorder. Primary outcome measures included the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness Scale (CGI-S) and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Iritability subscale score (ABC-I). Forty subjects, ages 8-40 years (mean 22.7 ± 7.3 years) received a mean final TJ-54 dosage of 6.4 ± 1.3 g/day (range 2.5-7.5 g/day). Full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ) scores ranged from 70 to 110 (mean 88.9 ± 13.2). Thirty-six (90%) of 40 subjects showed fewer interfering symptoms of irritability, including aggression, self-injury, and tantrums, with a final CGI-S of 1 or 2 (normal, not at all ill or borderline mentally ill) and a 80% or greater improvement on the ABC-I. The mean CGI-S score at baseline was 6.8 ± 0.8 whereas scores at end point was 1.9 ± 0.1 (< 0.0001). ABC-I scores ranged from 11 to 29 (mean 17.4 ± 3.66) at baseline, whereas scores at week 12 ranged from 0 to 5 (mean 0.93 ± 0.97) (p <0.0001). TJ-54 was well tolerated. No subject exited the study due to a drug-related adverse event. These preliminary data suggest that TJ-54 may be effective and well tolerated for treatment of severe irritability, lethargy/withdrawal, stereotypic behavior, hyperactivity/noncompliance, and inappropriate speech in patients with PDD-NOS or Asperger's disorder. However, given the characteristics of this trial, the present findings should be taken cautiously, and larger-scale placebo-controlled studies are needed to elucidate the efficacy and tolerability of TJ-54 in this understudied population.","Miyaoka Tsuyoshi, Wake Rei, Furuya Motohide, Liaury Kristian, Ieda Masa, Kawakami Kazunori, Tsuchie Keiko, Inagaki Takuji, Horiguchi Jun","BMC psychiatry","Adolescent, Adult, Asperger Syndrome, Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Drugs, Chinese Herbal, Female, Humans, Male, Pilot Projects, Prospective Studies, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Severity of Illness Index, Time Factors, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23194148","Department of Psychiatry, Shimane University School of Medicine, 89-1 Enyacho, Izumo 693-8501, Japan. miyanyan@med.shimane-u.ac.j",

This was a pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design trial of intranasal oxytocin versus placebo in 19 adults with ASD (16 males; 33.20 ± 13.29 years). Subjects were randomized to 24 IU intranasal oxytocin or placebo in the morning and afternoon for 6 weeks. Measures of social function/cognition (the Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy) and repetitive behaviors (Repetitive Behavior Scale Revised) were administered. Secondary measures included the Social Responsiveness Scale, Reading-the-Mind-in-the-Eyes Test and the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale - compulsion subscale and quality of life (World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire - emotional/social subscales). Full-information maximum-likelihood parameter estimates were obtained and tested using mixed-effects regression analyses. Although no significant changes were detected in the primary outcome measures after correcting for baseline differences, results suggested improvements after 6 weeks in measures of social cognition (Reading-the-Mind-in-the-Eyes Test, p = 0.002, d = 1.2), and quality of life (World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire - emotion, p = 0.031, d = 0.84), both secondary measures. Oxytocin was well tolerated and no serious adverse effects were reported. This pilot study suggests that there is therapeutic potential to daily administration of intranasal oxytocin in adults with ASD and that larger and longer studies are warranted.

Considering the stereotyped behavior is a core characteristic of ASD aimed to reduce, it is necessary to identify alternative reinforcers that does not encourage problematic behavior as well as is still effective. In this respect, the present study evaluates a possible alternative reinforcer: social interaction. The study compared the effects of preferred tangible and social reinforcers on skill acquisition, stereotyped behavior, and task engagement during the instruction period in three children, 3-8 years of age, with ASDs. This study had two phases: in the first phase, preference assessments and reinforcer assessments were conducted to identify the most highly preferred items and relative preferred type of reinforcers. In the second phase, teachers taught the target skills using two different reinforcers and the three dependent variables were compared between two reinforcer conditions. The results suggest that the reinforcers were equally effective; however tangible reinforcers resulted in high levels of stereotyped behavior. The results indicate that social reinforcers can be efficient reinforcers for the population. The study discussed making an efficient reinforcement decision for individuals with ASD.","Kang Soyeon, O'Reilly Mark, Rojeski Laura, Blenden Kara, Xu Ziwei, Davis Tonya, Sigafoos Jeff, Lancioni Giulio","Research in developmental disabilities","Behavior Therapy, Child, Child Behavior, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Child, Preschool, Female, Humans, Male, Reinforcement, Psychology, Reinforcement, Social, Social Behavior, Stereotyped Behavior","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23220050","The Meadows Center for Preventing Educational Risk, University of Texas at Austin, United States. syk77@austin.utexas.edu",

GABA-acting benzodiazepines exert in some patients with autism paradoxical effects, raising the possibility that like in epilepsies, GABA excites neurons because of elevated intracellular concentrations of chloride. Following a successful pilot study,(1) we have now performed a double-blind clinical trial using the diuretic, chloride-importer antagonist bumetanide that reduces intracellular chloride reinforcing GABAergic inhibition. Sixty children with autism or Asperger syndrome (3-11 years old) received for 3 months placebo or bumetanide (1 mg daily), followed by 1-month wash out. Determination of the severity of autism was made with video films at day 0 (D0) and D90 by blind, independent evaluators. Bumetanide reduced significantly the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) (D90-D0; P<0.004 treated vs placebo), Clinical Global Impressions (P<0.017 treated vs placebo) and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule values when the most severe cases (CARS values above the mean ± s.d.; n=9) were removed (Wilcoxon test: P-value=0.031; Student's t-test: P-value=0.017). Side effects were restricted to an occasional mild hypokalaemia (3.0-3.5 mM l(-1) K(+)) that was treated with supplemental potassium. In a companion study, chronic bumetanide treatment significantly improved accuracy in facial emotional labelling, and increased brain activation in areas involved in social and emotional perception (Hadjikhani et al., submitted). Therefore, bumetanide is a promising novel therapeutic agent to treat autism.

Participants were 50 referred adolescents (33 female, 54% ethnic minority) ages 14 to 18 (M = 15.9) meeting diagnostic criteria for a depressive disorder, and without comorbid psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, or concurrent treatments. Therapist homework-related behaviors were coded from audiotapes of Sessions 1 and 2 and used to predict adolescents' homework adherence, coded from audiotapes of Sessions 2 and 3. Several therapist behaviors were predictive of subsequent homework adherence, particularly for initially resistant or nonadherent adolescents. Stronger homework rationale and greater time allocated to explaining homework in Session 1 predicted greater adherence at Session 2, particularly for initially resistant adolescents. Stronger rationale and eliciting reactions/troubleshooting obstacles in Session 2 predicted greater adherence at Session 3, particularly for adolescents who were less adherent to prior homework. Strategies such as providing a strong rationale, allocating more time to assigning homework, and eliciting reactions/troubleshooting obstacles may be effective ways to bolster homework adherence among initially less engaged, depressed teens.","Jungbluth Nathaniel J, Shirk Stephen R","Journal of clinical child and adolescent psychology : the official journal for the Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, American Psychological Association, Division 53","Achievement, Adolescent, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Depressive Disorder, Female, Humans, Male, Professional-Patient Relations, Prospective Studies, Students, Treatment Outcome","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23237021","Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Medicine, Seattle Children's Hospital, 4800 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98105, USA.

Furthermore, participants in some studies chose to use functionally equivalent alternatives over severe problem behavior to produce the maintaining reinforcer. The present study added to this literature by having parents reinforce spontaneous requests functionally equivalent to problem behavior in their children with autism at home. First, parent-implemented functional analyses identified conditions associated with increased problem behavior and requests in two children with autism. Then, parents provided the maintaining reinforcer contingent on problem behavior alone or both problem behavior and requests in a withdrawal design. The treatment analysis indicated that the same reinforcer maintained child requests and problem behavior. In addition, when parents reinforced both requests and problem behavior, child participants demonstrated a preference for requests, thereby decreasing problem behavior. Implications of this relation for function-based treatment of problem behavior in children with autism are discussed.","Robertson Rachel E, Wehby Joseph H, King Susannah M","Research in developmental disabilities","Adult, Behavior Therapy, Child Behavior Disorders, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Child, Preschool, Female, Humans, Male, Parenting, Reinforcement, Psychology, Treatment Outcome","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23299185","Department of Special Education, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37203, USA. robertsonr@duq.edu",

Humoral and cellular immune responses were significantly higher in the immunised groups than the control group. On challenge with virulent SE, egg protection was 89.3% in immunised hens in group B (primed and boosted twice with JOL919 only), 89.3% in group C (primed with JOL919-JOL1228 mixture and boosted twice with JOL919), 100% in group D (primed and first booster with JOL919-JOL1228 mixture, then subsequently boosted with JOL919), 90.5% in group E (primed and boosted twice with JOL919-JOL1228 mixture) and 60.7% in group A (control group of non-immunised hens inoculated with phosphate buffered saline). The challenge strain was detected significantly less in all organs examined from hens in group D than those of the control group.

It is classified as a type of pervasive developmental disorder (PDD). All PDDs have a qualitative impairment in social relatedness. However, many individuals with PDDs have interfering symptoms, including irritability (aggression, self-injurious behavior, and severe tantrums). Behavioral therapy is often helpful in decreasing these behaviors; however, sometimes adjunctive medications are needed, because of the intensity and severity of irritability. Numerous medications have been tested on patients with PDDs. Although many of these medications have been demonstrated to be useful, no clear main treatment for PDD has emerged. Despite the efficacy of some of the medicines, acceptability and side effects have proven to be barriers to their use. Yokukansan (TJ-54), a traditional Japanese medicine, is composed of seven kinds of dried herbs. It is widely prescribed in clinical situations for treating psychiatric disorders by acting mainly on the glutamatergic and serotonergic nervous system. Recent studies indicate that TJ-54 may be safe and useful in treating behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia patients. We aimed at evaluating both the efficacy and the safety of TJ-54 in patients with PDDs. This was a 12 week prospective, open-label investigation of TJ-54 in 20 children and adolescents ages 6-17 years diagnosed with PDDs. Primary outcome measures included the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement of Illness Scale (CGI-I), Children's Global Assessment Score (CGAS), and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) irritability subscale. Twenty subjects, ages 6-17 years, received TJ-54 in the dosage range of 2.5-7.5 g/day. The CGI-I was significantly improved from 8 weeks (p<0.001). The mean CGAS was 31.92 at baseline, whereas the mean final score at 12 weeks was 54.52 (p<0.001). The ABC irritability/agitation subscale (subscale 1) was significantly improved from 8 weeks, and the hyperactivity/noncompliance subscale (subscale 4) was significantly improved in 12 weeks. TJ-54 was well tolerated. No subject left the study because of a drug-related adverse event. These preliminary data suggest that TJ-54 may be effective and well tolerated for the treatment of severe irritability/agitation and hyperactivity/noncompliance in children and adolescents ages 6-17 years with PDD. However, given the characteristics of this trial, the present findings should be taken cautiously, and larger-scale placebo-controlled studies are needed to elucidate the efficacy and tolerability of TJ-54 in this understudied population.","Wake Rei, Miyaoka Tsuyoshi, Inagaki Takuji, Furuya Motohide, Ieda Masa, Liaury Kristian, Kishi Kazuko, Horiguchi Jun","Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology","Adolescent, Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Drugs, Chinese Herbal, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Irritable Mood, Male, Pilot Projects, Prospective Studies, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Severity of Illness Index, Time Factors, Treatment Outcome","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23782127","Department of Psychiatry, Shimane University Faculty of Medicine, Izumo, Shimane, Japan. rei@med.shimane-u.ac.jp",

Children with DD are also at high risk for exhibiting significant behaviour problems. Parental stress has been shown to impact the development of these behaviour problems; however, it is rarely addressed in interventions aimed at reducing child behaviour problems. The current study examined the efficacy of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) for parents of children with DD by investigating whether this intervention is effective in reducing parenting stress and whether decreases in parenting stress lead to reductions in behaviour problems among children with DD. Forty six parents of children with DD were randomly assigned to an immediate treatment or wait list-control group. Participants completed questionnaires assessing parental stress and child behaviour problems at intake and at a second assessment, which took place after only the immediate treatment group had received the MBSR. Parents who participated in MBSR reported significantly less stress and depression as well as greater life satisfaction compared with wait list-control parents. Regarding child outcomes, children whose parents participated in MBSR were reported to have fewer behaviour problems following the intervention, specifically in the areas of attention problems and ADHD symptomatology. Results indicated that MBSR may be an effective intervention for ameliorating parental stress and mental health problems among parents of children with DD. Additionally, these benefits may 'spill over' and improve behaviour challenges among these children.","Neece Cameron L","Journal of applied research in intellectual disabilities : JARID","Adaptation, Psychological, Adult, Child Behavior Disorders, Child, Preschool, Developmental Disabilities, Female, Humans, Male, Mindfulness, Parenting, Parents, Stress, Psychological, Surveys and Questionnaires, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23813562","Department of Psychology, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA, USA.",

Riluzole is a glutamate-modulating agent with neuroprotective properties, which has been shown to have positive effects in many neuropsychiatric disorders. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of riluzole as an adjunctive to risperidone in the treatment of irritability in autistic children who were not optimally responding to previous medications. This was a 10-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial. The study enrolled male and female outpatients aged 5-12 years with a diagnosis of autistic disorder based on the DSM-IV-TR criteria and a score of ≥12 on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) irritability subscale who had discontinued other medications because of a lack of efficacy. Subjects received riluzole (titrated to 50 or 100 mg/day based on bodyweight) or placebo in addition to risperidone (titrated up to 2 or 3 mg/day based on bodyweight) for 10 weeks. Patients were assessed at baseline, week 5, and week 10. The primary outcome measure was the difference in the change in the ABC-C irritability subscale score from baseline to week 10 between the two groups. We also compared changes in other ABC-C subscale scores and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale scores between the two groups. Forty-nine patients were enrolled in the study, and forty children completed the trial (dropouts: placebo = 4, riluzole = 5). A significantly greater improvement in the study primary outcome (the ABC-C irritability subscale score) was achieved by the riluzole-treated children compared with the placebo group (P = 0.03).

Forty-six age- and IQ-matched ASD children were randomly assigned to receive group training in Nei Yang Gong (experimental group) or PMR (control group) twice per week for four weeks. The participants' self-control was measured by three neuropsychological tests and parental rating on standardized questionnaires, and the underlying neural mechanism was assessed by the participants' brain EEG activity during an inhibitory-control task before and after intervention. The results show that the experimental group demonstrated significantly greater improvement in self-control than the control group, which concurs with the parental reports of reduced autistic symptoms and increased control of temper and behaviors. In addition, the experimental group showed enhanced EEG activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, a region that mediates self-control, whereas the PMR group did not.

Although a frequently recommended practice, the few studies that have addressed the efficacy of social skills groups have shown mixed results. To determine the effectiveness of social skills groups for improving social competence, social communication, and quality of life for people with ASD who are six to 21 years of age. We searched the following databases in December 2011: CENTRAL (2011 Issue 4), MEDLINE (1948 to November Week 3, 2011), EMBASE (1980 to Week 50, 2011), PsycINFO (1887 to December Week 2, 2011), CINAHL (1937 to current), ERIC (1966 to current), Sociological Abstracts (1952 to current), OCLC WorldCat (12 December 2011), Social Science Citation Index (1970 to 16 December 2011), and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (20 December 2011). We also searched the reference lists of published papers. Randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing treatment (social skills groups) with a control group who were not receiving the treatment for participants aged six to 21 years with ASD. The control group could be no intervention, wait list, or treatment as usual. Outcomes sought were standardized measures of social competence, social communication, quality of life, emotion recognition, and any other specific behaviors. Two review authors independently selected and appraised studies for inclusion and assessed the risk of bias in each included study. All outcome data were continuous and standardized mean difference effect sizes (ES) with small sample correction were calculated. We conducted random-effects meta-analysis where possible. We included five RCTs evaluating the effects of social skills groups in 196 participants with ASD aged 6 to 21 years old. The results show there is some evidence that social skills groups improve overall social competence (ES = 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.78, P = 0.003) and friendship quality (ES = 0.41, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.81, P = 0.04) for this population. No differences were found between treatment and control groups in relation to emotional recognition (ES = 0.34, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.88, P = 0.21) assessed in two studies or social communication as related to the understanding of idioms (ES = 0.05, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.72, P = 0.89), which was assessed in only one study. Two additional quality of life outcomes were evaluated, with results of single studies suggesting decreases in loneliness (ES = -0.66, 95% CI -1.15 to -0.17) but no effect on child or parental depression. No adverse events were reported. Given the nature of the intervention and the selected outcome measures, the risk of performance and detection bias are high. There is limited generalizability from the studies as they were all conducted in the US; they focused mainly on children aged 7 to 12, and the participants were all of average or above average intelligence.

Preliminary evidence suggests oxytocin may have potential as an intervention for autism. We evaluated a 5-day 'live-in' intervention using a double-blind randomized control trial. 38 male youths (7-16 years old) with autism spectrum disorders were administered 24 or 12 international units (depending on weight) intranasal placebo or oxytocin once daily over four consecutive days. The oxytocin or placebo was administered during parent-child interaction training sessions. Parent and child behaviours were assessed using parent reports, clinician ratings, and independent observations, at multiple time points to measure side-effects; social interaction skills; repetitive behaviours; emotion recognition and diagnostic status. Compared to placebo, intranasal oxytocin did not significantly improve emotion recognition, social interaction skills, or general behavioral adjustment in male youths with autism spectrum disorders. The results show that the benefits of nasal oxytocin for young individuals with autism spectrum disorders may be more circumscribed than suggested by previous studies, and suggest caution in recommending it as an intervention that is broadly effective.","Dadds Mark R, MacDonald Elayne, Cauchi Avril, Williams Katrina, Levy Florence, Brennan John","Journal of autism and developmental disorders","Administration, Intranasal, Adolescent, Autistic Disorder, Child, Double-Blind Method, Humans, Male, Oxytocin, Parent-Child Relations, Placebos, Social Behavior","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23888359","School of Psychology, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, 2052, Australia, m.dadds@unsw.edu.au.",

Even adults with high-functioning ASD have difficulties in social communication and, therefore, have deficits in understanding others' minds. Recent research has found that they are unable to understand not only others' minds, but also their own minds. This could lead to difficulties in self-regulation. Some studies have reported the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in improving self-regulation, especially in reducing anxiety in children and teenagers with ASD. However, few studies have examined adults with ASD. Therefore, this study investigated the efficacy of group-based CBT for adults with ASD. Our hypothesis is that adults with ASD can understand their own emotions. exercise self-regulation, and thus alleviate their own secondary symptoms, such as anxiety and depression. The study is a randomized open-blind study with centralization using minimization and blind assessors.

The purpose of our study was to develop a manualized behavioral parent training (BPT) program for parents of young children with ASD and sleep disturbances and to test the feasibility, fidelity, and initial efficacy of the treatment in a small randomized controlled trial (RCT). Parents of a sample of 40 young children diagnosed with ASD with an average age of 3.5years were enrolled in our study. Participants were randomized to either the BPT program group or a comparison group who were given nonsleep-related parent education. Each participant was individually administered a 5-session program delivered over the 8-week study. Outcome measures of feasibility, fidelity, and efficacy were collected at weeks 4 and 8 after the baseline time point. Children's sleep was assessed by parent report and objectively by actigraphy. Of the 20 participants in each group, data were available for 15 participants randomized to BPT and 18 participants randomized to the comparison condition. Results supported the feasibility of the manualized parent training program and the comparison program. Treatment fidelity was high for both groups. The BPT program group significantly improved more than the comparison group based on the primary sleep outcome of parent report. There were no objective changes in sleep detected by actigraphy. Our study is one of few RCTs of a BPT program to specifically target sleep disturbances in a well-characterized sample of young children with ASD and to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.

Biologic hypotheses suggest that an overly rapid brain growth leads to the core symptoms of ASD by impairing connectivity. Literature is divided however where deleterious, protective and null associations of HC with ASD symptoms in individuals with ASD have been found. Individuals (n = 1,416) from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange with ASD were examined for associations of HC with ASD like symptoms. Mixed models controlling for sex, age, race/ethnicity, simplex/multiplex status and accounting for correlations between siblings were used. Interactions by simplex/multiplex were explored. Adjustments for height in a sub-population with available data were explored as well. A Significant interaction term (p = 0.03) suggested that the effect of HC was dependent on whether the individual was simplex or multiplex. In simplex individuals at mean age (8.9 years) 1 cm increase in head circumference was associated with a 24% increase in the odds of a high social diagnostic score from the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (odds ratio  = 1.24, p = 0.01). There was no association in multiplex individuals. Additionally, individuals classified with a non-verbal IQ <70 were 90% simplex and had a significantly increased head circumference (0.7 cm p = 0.03) relative to a mid-range non-verbal IQ group. Interestingly, children classified with a >110 non-verbal IQ also had an increased HC (0.4 cm p = 0.04), relative to a mid-range non-verbal IQ group, and were 90% multiplex. HC effects do not appear to be confounded by height, however, larger samples with height information are needed.

Twelve weeks of treatment with citalopram (10 mg/5 mL) or placebo. The mean (SD) maximum dose of citalopram was 16.5 (6.5) mg by mouth daily (maximum dose, 20 mg/d). A positive response was defined as having a score of at least much improved on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale at week 12.

Clinical variables included baseline illness severity ratings (the Aberrant Behavior Checklist, the Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised, and the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale). Family measures included the Caregiver Strain Questionnaire. Several baseline predictors of response were identified, and a principal component analysis yielded 3 composite measures (disruptive behavior, autism/mood, and caregiver strain) that significantly predicted response at week 12. Specifically, participants in the placebo group were significantly less likely than participants in the citalopram group to respond at week 12 if they entered the study more symptomatic on each of the 3 composite measures, and they were at least 2 times less likely to be responders.

In this paper, we summarize the results of this Italian-Israeli consensus conference. ASDs constitute a class of severe and heterogeneous neurodevelopmental conditions caused by atypical brain development beginning during early prenatal life, reflecting many genetic, neurobiological and environmental influences. The first clinical signs of ASDs begin to be evident in children between 12 and 18 months of age, often after a period of relatively typical postnatal development. Recent longitudinal studies reveal substantial diversity in developmental trajectories through childhood and adolescence. Some intervention approaches have been demonstrated to be effective in improving core symptoms of ASDs, even if the heterogeneity and developmental nature of the disorder make it implausible that only one specific treatment will be best for all children with ASDs. More randomized control trials (RCTs) on early intervention are needed to identify the most effective strategies and provide the most efficient allocation of resources during the critical early intervention time period. Future research should focus on linking biological phenotypes with specific genotypes, thus establishing a foundation for the development of diagnostic screening tools and individualization of treatments.","Zachor Ditza A, Curatolo Paolo,  ","European journal of paediatric neurology : EJPN : official journal of the European Paediatric Neurology Society","Adolescent, Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Early Diagnosis, Female, Humans, Israel, Italy, Male","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24095105","Department of Pediatrics, The Autism Center, Assaf Harofe Medical Center, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.; Department of Neuroscience, Pediatric Neurology Unit, Tor Vergata University of Rome, Tor Vergata University, via Montpellier 1, 00133 Rome, Italy.

Behavioral intervention represents an effective treatment for chronic feeding concerns in this population; however, evidence has largely been established with trained therapists working in highly structured settings. This pilot study seeks to fill this gap in the literature by describing and evaluating the Autism MEAL Plan, a behaviorally based parent-training curriculum to address feeding problems associated with autism spectrum disorders. We assessed the feasibility of the intervention in terms of program content and study protocol (e.g. recruitment and retention of participants, assessment procedures), as well as efficacy in terms of changes in feeding behaviors. A total of 10 families participated in the treatment condition, and the program was evaluated using a waitlist control design (n = 9), representing the first randomized-control study of a feeding intervention in autism spectrum disorders.

This study was a post-hoc analysis of pooled data from two 8-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies evaluating aripiprazole for the treatment of irritability in pediatric subjects with autistic disorder, aged 6-17 years. Subjects were stratified by PAE; adverse events (AEs), and changes in weight, and metabolic measures were evaluated. For subjects receiving aripiprazole, regardless of PAE, baseline weight, age, gender, and symptom severity were evaluated in a regression model predicting body weight change. Of 316 randomized subjects, 259 (82.0%) were antipsychotic naïve (AN) and 57 (18.0%) had a PAE. Aripiprazole-treated AN subjects were more likely than PAE subjects to report somnolence (11.9% vs. 2.8%), sedation (22.7% vs. 11.1%), or fatigue (17.0% vs. 13.9%). Rates of extrapyramidal disorder and drooling, but not akathisia or tremor, were marginally higher in AN subjects. Overall, 10.8% of aripiprazole-treated AN subjects had at least one AE leading to discontinuation compared with 8.3% of aripiprazole-treated PAE subjects. AN subjects receiving aripiprazole had a larger change in weight from baseline to endpoint compared with those receiving placebo (1.9 vs. 0.7 kg; treatment difference 1.2 kg, 95% CI: 0.5, 1.9) than PAE subjects receiving aripiprazole compared with subjects receiving placebo (0.4 vs. -0.4 kg; treatment difference 0.9 kg, 95% CI: -0.6, 2.4).

A randomized clinical trial compared 6 sessions of PSE with usual care. Settings included an autism clinic and 6 community-based early intervention programs that primarily serve low-income families. Participants were mothers of 122 young children (mean age, 34 months) who recently received a diagnosis of ASD. Among mothers assessed for eligibility, 17.0% declined participation.

Problem-solving education is a brief, cognitive intervention delivered in six 30-minute individualized sessions by existing staff (early intervention programs) or research staff without formal mental health training (autism clinic). Primary outcomes were parental stress and maternal depressive symptoms. Fifty-nine mothers were randomized to receive PSE and 63 to receive usual care. The follow-up rate was 91.0%. Most intervention mothers (78.0%) received the full PSE course.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe and efficacious technique when targeting specific areas of cortical dysfunction in major depressive disorder, and a similar approach could yield therapeutic benefits in ASD, if applied to relevant cortical regions. The aim of this study was to examine whether deep rTMS to bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex improves social relating in ASD. 28 adults diagnosed with either autistic disorder (high-functioning) or Asperger's disorder completed a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design with 2 weeks of daily weekday treatment. This involved deep rTMS to bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (5 Hz, 10-s train duration, 20-s inter-train interval) for 15 min (1500 pulses per session) using a HAUT-Coil. The sham rTMS coil was encased in the same helmet of the active deep rTMS coil, but no effective field was delivered into the brain. Assessments were conducted before, after, and one month following treatment. Participants in the active condition showed a near significant reduction in self-reported social relating symptoms from pre-treatment to one month follow-up, and a significant reduction in social relating symptoms (relative to sham participants) for both post-treatment assessments. Those in the active condition also showed a reduction in self-oriented anxiety during difficult and emotional social situations from pre-treatment to one month follow-up. There were no changes for those in the sham condition. Deep rTMS to bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex yielded a reduction in social relating impairment and socially-related anxiety.

In this 6 month (26 week) open-label extension (OLE) study, patients (5-17 years of age, who completed the previous fixed-dose, 6 week, double-blind [DB] phase) were flexibly dosed with risperidone based on body weight. The maximum allowed dose was 1.25 mg/day for those weighing 20 to <45 kg, and 1.75 mg/day for those weighing ≥ 45 kg. The study primarily assessed risperidone's safety; efficacy was assessed as a secondary end-point. Fifty-six (71%) out of 79 enrolled patients completed the OLE; the most common discontinuations were for insufficient response (7 [9%]) or adverse events (AE) (5 [6%]). The most common (≥ 5% frequency in the total group) AEs were increased appetite (11% [n=9]); increased weight and vomiting (9% [n=7] each); sedation, pyrexia, and upper respiratory tract infection (8% [n=6] each); nasopharyngitis (6% [n=5]); and somnolence and fatigue (5% [n=4] each). Extrapyramidal AEs were reported in 6 (8%) patients. Increase in mean weight (11-15%) and body mass index (5-10%) occurred; one patient discontinued because of weight increase.

Despite growing prospects for oxytocin as a therapeutic agent for ASD, no direct neurobiological evidence exists for oxytocin's beneficial effects on this core symptom of ASD. This is slowing clinical application of the neuropeptide. To directly examine whether oxytocin has beneficial effects on the sociocommunicational deficits of ASD using both behavioral and neural measures. At the University of Tokyo Hospital, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject-crossover, single-site experimental trial in which intranasal oxytocin and placebo were administered. A total of 40 highly functioning men with ASD participated and were randomized in the trial. Single-dose intranasal administration of oxytocin (24 IU) and placebo. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined effects of oxytocin on behavioral neural responses of the participants to a social psychological task. In our previous case-control study using the same psychological task, when making decisions about social information with conflicting verbal and nonverbal contents, participants with ASD made judgments based on nonverbal contents less frequently with longer time and could not induce enough activation in the medial prefrontal cortex. Therefore, our main outcomes and measures were the frequency of the nonverbal information-based judgments (NVJs), the response time for NVJs, and brain activity of the medial prefrontal cortex during NVJs. Intranasal oxytocin enabled the participants to make NVJs more frequently (P = .03) with shorter response time (P = .02). During the mitigated behavior, oxytocin increased the originally diminished brain activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (P < .001). Moreover, oxytocin enhanced functional coordination in the area (P < .001), and the magnitude of these neural effects was predictive of the behavioral effects (P ≤ .01). These findings provide the first neurobiological evidence for oxytocin's beneficial effects on sociocommunicational deficits of ASD and give us the initial account for neurobiological mechanisms underlying any beneficial effects of the neuropeptide. umin.ac.jp/ctr Identifier: UMIN000002241 and UMIN000004393.","Watanabe Takamitsu, Abe Osamu, Kuwabara Hitoshi, Yahata Noriaki, Takano Yosuke, Iwashiro Norichika, Natsubori Tatsunobu, Aoki Yuta, Takao Hidemasa, Kawakubo Yuki, Kamio Yoko, Kato Nobumasa, Miyashita Yasushi, Kasai Kiyoto, Yamasue Hidenori","JAMA psychiatry","Administration, Intranasal, Adult, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Oxytocin, Placebo Effect, Prefrontal Cortex, Social Behavior, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24352377","Department of Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan6Global Center of Excellence Program, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Radiology, School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Radiology, School of Medicine, Nihon University, Tokyo, Japan4Department of Radiology, School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Child and Adolescent Mental Health, National Institute of Mental Health, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan2Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, Showa University, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan8Department of Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, Showa University, Tokyo, Japan9Japan Science and Technology Agency, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Child Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.",

Repeated-measures analyses within patients assessed drug effects. Patients under each drug condition were compared with controls to assess normalization effects. fMRI data showed that, under placebo, ASD boys underactivated medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), compared with control and ADHD boys. Both patient groups shared decreased precuneus activation. Under Fluoxetine, mPFC activation was up-regulated and normalized in ASD boys relative to controls, but down-regulated in ADHD boys relative to placebo, which was concomitant with worse task performance in ADHD. Fluoxetine therefore has inverse effects on mPFC activation in ASD and ADHD during reversal learning, suggesting dissociated underlying serotonin abnormalities.","Chantiluke Kaylita, Barrett Nadia, Giampietro Vincent, Brammer Michael, Simmons Andrew, Murphy Declan G, Rubia Katya","Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)","Adolescent, Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity, Autistic Disorder, Brain Mapping, Child, Double-Blind Method, Fluoxetine, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Neuropsychological Tests, Prefrontal Cortex, Reversal Learning, Reward, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24451919","Department of Forensic and Developmental Sciences, King's College London, London, UK.; Department of Neuroimaging, Institute of Psychiatry.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.; South London and Maudsley NHS Trust.; Department of Neuroimaging, Institute of Psychiatry NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health at South London and Maudsley NHS Trust.",

A Web-based nationally representative 2-wave survey experiment was conducted with 1759 parents age 18 years and older residing in the United States who have children in their household age 17 years or younger (conducted June-July 2011). Parents were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 4 interventions: (1) information explaining the lack of evidence that MMR causes autism from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; (2) textual information about the dangers of the diseases prevented by MMR from the Vaccine Information Statement; (3) images of children who have diseases prevented by the MMR vaccine; (4) a dramatic narrative about an infant who almost died of measles from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention fact sheet; or to a control group. None of the interventions increased parental intent to vaccinate a future child. Refuting claims of an MMR/autism link successfully reduced misperceptions that vaccines cause autism but nonetheless decreased intent to vaccinate among parents who had the least favorable vaccine attitudes. In addition, images of sick children increased expressed belief in a vaccine/autism link and a dramatic narrative about an infant in danger increased self-reported belief in serious vaccine side effects.

Thirteen children with ASD (7-11 years old) were randomly assigned to 32 sessions of CBT or community-based psychosocial treatment (TAU) for 16 weeks. The CBT program is based on the memory retrieval competition model and emphasizes the development of perspective-taking through guided behavioral experimentation supplemented with reflective Socratic discussion and supported by parent training and school consultation to promote generalization of social communication and emotion regulation skills. Trained observers blind to treatment condition observed each child during recess on two separate days at baseline and again at posttreatment, using a structured behavioral observation system that generates frequency scores for observed social communication-related autism symptoms. CBT outperformed TAU at posttreatment on the frequency of self-isolation, the proportion of time spent with peers, the frequency of positive or appropriate interaction with peers, and the frequency of positive or appropriate peer responses to the target child (d effect size range 1.34-1.62). On average, children in CBT were engaged in positive or appropriate social interaction with peers in 68.6% of observed intervals at posttreatment, compared to 25% of intervals for children in TAU. Further investigation of this intervention modality with larger samples and follow-up assessments is warranted.","Wood Jeffrey J, Fujii Cori, Renno Patricia, Van Dyke Marilyn","Journal of autism and developmental disorders","Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Female, Humans, Male, Play and Playthings, Schools, Severity of Illness Index, Treatment Outcome","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24671750","Department of Education, University of California, Los Angeles, Moore Hall, Box 951521, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA, jwood@gseis.ucla.edu.",

Less is known about the modulatory influence of OXT on the neural and emotional responses to human interpersonal touch. The present randomized placebo (PLC)-controlled within-subject pharmaco-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was designed to test the hypothesis that a single intranasal dose of synthetic OXT (24 IU) would facilitate both neural and emotional responses to interpersonal touch in a context- (female vs male touch) and trait- (autistic trait load) specific manner. Specifically, the experimental rationale was to manipulate the reward value of interpersonal touch independent of the intensity and type of actual cutaneous stimulation administered. Thus, 40 heterosexual males believed that they were touched by either a man or a woman, although in fact an identical pattern of touch was always given by the same female experimenter blind to condition type. Our results show that OXT increased the perceived pleasantness of female, but not male touch, and associated neural responses in insula, precuneus, orbitofrontal, and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex. Moreover, the behavioral and neural effects of OXT were negatively correlated with autistic-like traits. Taken together, this is the first study to show that the perceived hedonic value of human heterosexual interpersonal touch is facilitated by OXT in men, but that its behavioral and neural effects in this context are blunted in individuals with autistic traits.","Scheele Dirk, Kendrick Keith M, Khouri Christoph, Kretzer Elisa, Schläpfer Thomas E, Stoffel-Wagner Birgit, Güntürkün Onur, Maier Wolfgang, Hurlemann René","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Administration, Intranasal, Adult, Autistic Disorder, Brain, Brain Mapping, Central Nervous System Agents, Double-Blind Method, Emotions, Heterosexuality, Humans, Interpersonal Relations, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Oxytocin, Reward, Touch Perception","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24694924","1] Department of Psychiatry, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany [2] Division of Medical Psychology, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.; Department of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.; 1] Department of Psychiatry, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany [2] Departments of Psychiatry and Mental Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.; 1] Department of Psychiatry, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany [2] German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Bonn, Germany.; Key Laboratory for Neuroinformation, School of Life Science and Technology, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, PR China.; Department of Biopsychology, Ruhr University, Bochum, Germany.",

Whereas current pharmacological interventions for ASD focus primarily on psychiatric symptoms, including agitation and obsessive behaviors, few agents target core symptomatology. It has been previously hypothesized that abnormalities in facial scanning, such as reduced eye contact or increased mouth fixation, contribute to social communication deficits in ASD. In addition, previous reports have suggested elevated stress and anxiety in ASD, symptoms that are believed to impact facial scanning patterns. The present pilot study sought to explore the effects of pharmacological intervention via propranolol, a nonselective β-adrenergic antagonist and known anxiolytic, on facial scanning in ASD. Specifically, we wished to determine whether there is an increase in eye contact and a decrease in mouth fixation with administration of propranolol. A sample of 14 participants with ASD and 14 matched controls participated in two study sessions in which propranolol and placebo were administered in a counterbalanced, double-blinded manner. At each session, ocular fixation data were collected during presentation of video stimuli of 16 human faces. Fixation time on the eye, nose, and mouth regions of the face stimuli was analyzed. The baseline fixation patterns for the ASD and control groups did not significantly differ; however, administration of propranolol was associated with a significant reduction in mouth fixation for the ASD group. Additionally, mouth fixation was positively related to nonverbal communication impairment in the ASD group. Although eye fixation in ASD appears typical in the present study, the effect of propranolol in reducing mouth fixation suggests an important focus for further research. Future studies are needed to better characterize the relationship between stress and anxiety and facial scanning in ASD, as well as the effects of pharmacological intervention.","Zamzow Rachel M, Christ Shawn E, Saklayen Sanjida S, Moffitt Amanda J, Bodner Kimberly E, Higgins Katherine F, Beversdorf David Q","Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology","Adolescent, Adrenergic beta-Antagonists, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Double-Blind Method, Face, Female, Fixation, Ocular, Humans, Male, Pattern Recognition, Visual, Pilot Projects, Propranolol, Social Perception, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24730708","a Interdisciplinary Neuroscience Program , University of Missouri , Columbia , MO , USA.",

A total of 61 minimally verbal children with autism, aged 5 to 8 years, were randomized to a blended developmental/behavioral intervention (JASP+EMT) with or without the augmentation of a SGD for 6 months with a 3-month follow-up. The intervention consisted of 2 stages. In stage 1, all children received 2 sessions per week for 3 months. Stage 2 intervention was adapted (by increased sessions or adding the SGD) based on the child's early response. The primary outcome was the total number of spontaneous communicative utterances; secondary measures were the total number of novel words and total comments from a natural language sample. Primary aim results found improvements in spontaneous communicative utterances, novel words, and comments that all favored the blended behavioral intervention that began by including an SGD (JASP+EMT+SGD) as opposed to spoken words alone (JASP+EMT). Secondary aim results suggest that the adaptive intervention beginning with JASP+EMT+SGD and intensifying JASP+EMT+SGD for children who were slow responders led to better posttreatment outcomes. Minimally verbal school-aged children can make significant and rapid gains in spoken spontaneous language with a novel, blended intervention that focuses on joint engagement and play skills and incorporates an SGD.

We asked whether these chemical messengers interact in the regulation of emotion-based behavior by administering OXT or placebo to 24 healthy subjects and mapping cerebral 5-HT system by using 2'-methoxyphenyl-(N-2'-pyridinyl)-p-[(18)F]fluoro-benzamidoethylpiperazine ([(18)F]MPPF), an antagonist of 5-HT1A receptors. OXT increased [(18)F]MPPF nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), the core area of 5-HT synthesis, and in the amygdala/hippocampal complex, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex. Importantly, the amygdala appears central in the regulation of 5-HT by OXT: [(18)F]MPPF BPND changes in the DRN correlated with changes in right amygdala, which were in turn correlated with changes in hippocampus, insula, subgenual, and orbitofrontal cortex, a circuit implicated in the control of stress, mood, and social behaviors. OXT administration is known to inhibit amygdala activity and results in a decrease of anxiety, whereas high amygdala activity and 5-HT dysregulation have been associated with increased anxiety. The present study reveals a previously unidentified form of interaction between these two systems in the human brain, i.e., the role of OXT in the inhibitory regulation of 5-HT signaling, which could lead to novel therapeutic strategies for mental disorders.","Mottolese Raphaelle, Redouté Jérôme, Costes Nicolas, Le Bars Didier, Sirigu Angela","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","Administration, Intranasal, Adult, Amygdala, Binding, Competitive, Brain, Double-Blind Method, Frontal Lobe, Gyrus Cinguli, Hippocampus, Humans, Male, Oxytocin, Piperazines, Positron-Emission Tomography, Pyridines, Raphe Nuclei, Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A, Serotonin, Serotonin 5-HT1 Receptor Antagonists, Signal Transduction, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24912179","Centre d'Etude et de Recherche Multimodal et Pluridisciplinaire Imagerie du Vivant, 69003 Lyon, France.; University Claude Bernard Lyon 1, 69609 Lyon, France; andCentre d'Etude et de Recherche Multimodal et Pluridisciplinaire Imagerie du Vivant, 69003 Lyon, France.; Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, Unité Mixte de Recherche 5229, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, 69675 Bron, France;University Claude Bernard Lyon 1, 69609 Lyon, France; and sirigu@isc.cnrs.fr.; Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, Unité Mixte de Recherche 5229, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, 69675 Bron, France;University Claude Bernard Lyon 1, 69609 Lyon, France; and.",

The current study tested the hypothesis that pain reduction with tDCS is associated with an increase in the peak frequency spectrum density in the theta-alpha range. Twenty patients with spinal cord injury and bilateral neuropathic pain received single sessions of both sham and anodal tDCS (2 mA) over the left primary motor area (M1) for 20 min. Treatment order was randomly assigned. Pre- to post-procedure changes in pain intensity and peak frequency of electroencephalogram spectral analysis were compared between treatment conditions. The active treatment condition (anodal tDCS over M1) but not sham treatment resulted in significant decreases in pain intensity. In addition, consistent with the study hypothesis, peak theta-alpha frequency (PTAF) assessed from an electrode placed over the site of stimulation increased more from pre- to post-session among participants in the active tDCS condition, relative to those in the sham tDCS condition. Moreover, we found a significant association between a decrease in pain intensity and an increase in PTAF at the stimulation site. The findings are consistent with the possibility that anodal tDCS over the left M1 may be effective, at least in part, because it results in an increase in M1 cortical excitability, perhaps due to a pain inhibitory effect of motor cortex stimulation that may influence the descending pain modulation system. Future research is needed to determine if there is a causal association between increased left anterior activity and pain reduction. The results provide new findings regarding the effects of tDCS on neuropathic pain and brain oscillation changes.","Ngernyam Niran, Jensen Mark P, Arayawichanon Preeda, Auvichayapat Narong, Tiamkao Somsak, Janjarasjitt Suparerk, Punjaruk Wiyada, Amatachaya Anuwat, Aree-uea Benchaporn, Auvichayapat Paradee","Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology","Adult, Aged, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Electroencephalography, Evoked Potentials, Motor, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Motor Cortex, Neuralgia, Spinal Cord Injuries, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation, Treatment Outcome","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25027640","Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, 40002 Thailand.; Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, USA.; Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, 40002 Thailand.; Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, 40002 Thailand.; Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, 40002 Thailand.; Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, 40002 Thailand.

The therapy targeted parental behaviour, with no direct interaction between therapist and child. While nonsignificant group differences were found on ADOS-G score, significant group differences were found for both parent and child intermediate outcomes. This study aimed to better understand the mechanism by which the PACT treatment influenced changes in child behaviour though the targeted parent behaviour. Mediation analysis was used to assess the direct and indirect effects of treatment via parent behaviour on child behaviour and via child behaviour on ADOS-G score. Alternative mediation was explored to study whether the treatment effect acted as hypothesised or via another plausible pathway. Mediation models typically assume no unobserved confounding between mediator and outcome and no measurement error in the mediator. We show how to better exploit the information often available within a trial to begin to address these issues, examining scope for instrumental variable and measurement error models. Estimates of mediation changed substantially when account was taken of the confounder effects of the baseline value of the mediator and of measurement error. Our best estimates that accounted for both suggested that the treatment effect on the ADOS-G score was very substantially mediated by parent synchrony and child initiations. The results highlighted the value of repeated measurement of mediators during trials. The theoretical model underlying the PACT treatment was supported. However, the substantial fall-off in treatment effect highlighted both the need for additional data and for additional target behaviours for therapy.","Pickles Andrew, Harris Victoria, Green Jonathan, Aldred Catherine, McConachie Helen, Slonims Vicky, Le Couteur Ann, Hudry Kristelle, Charman Tony,  ","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","Adult, Autistic Disorder, Child, Preschool, Communication, Female, Humans, Male, Parent-Child Relations, Parents, Psychotherapy, Group, Research Design, Single-Blind Method, Treatment Outcome","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25039961","Department of Biostatistics, Institute of Psychiatry, Kings College London, London, UK.",

Although the cumulative stress and disease burden of these mothers is exceptionally high, and associated with poorer outcomes in children, policies and practices primarily serve the identified child with disabilities. A total of 243 mothers of children with disabilities were consented and randomized into either Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (mindfulness practice) or Positive Adult Development (positive psychology practice). Well-trained, supervised peer mentors led 6 weeks of group treatments in 1.5-hour weekly sessions, assessing mothers 6 times before, during, and up to 6 months after treatment. Mothers had children with autism (65%) or other disabilities (35%). At baseline, 85% of this community sample had significantly elevated stress, 48% were clinically depressed, and 41% had anxiety disorders. Using slopes-as-outcomes, mixed random effects models, both treatments led to significant reductions in stress, depression, and anxiety, and improved sleep and life satisfaction, with large effects in depression and anxiety. Mothers in Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction versus Positive Adult Development had greater improvements in anxiety, depression, sleep, and well-being. Mothers of children with autism spectrum disorder improved less in anxiety, but did not otherwise differ from their counterparts. Future studies are warranted on how trained mentors and professionals can address the unmet mental health needs of mothers of children with developmental disabilities.

The biological basis of this is unknown but may include differences in the modulatory role of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, which are implicated in the condition. However, this has never been tested directly. We therefore assessed the modifying role of serotonin on inhibitory brain function during a Go/No-Go task in 14 adults with autism and normal intelligence and 14 control subjects that did not differ in gender, age and intelligence. We undertook a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of acute tryptophan depletion using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Following sham, adults with autism relative to controls had reduced activation in key inhibitory regions of inferior frontal cortex and thalamus, but increased activation of caudate and cerebellum. However, brain activation was modulated in opposite ways by depletion in each group. Within autistic individuals depletion upregulated fronto-thalamic activations and downregulated striato-cerebellar activations toward control sham levels, completely 'normalizing' the fronto-cerebellar dysfunctions. The opposite pattern occurred in controls. Moreover, the severity of autism was related to the degree of differential modulation by depletion within frontal, striatal and thalamic regions. Our findings demonstrate that individuals with autism have abnormal inhibitory networks, and that serotonin has a differential, opposite, effect on them in adults with and without autism. Together these factors may partially explain the severity of autistic behaviours and/or provide a novel (tractable) treatment target.","Daly Eileen, Ecker Christine, Hallahan Brian, Deeley Quinton, Craig Michael, Murphy Clodagh, Johnston Patrick, Spain Debbie, Gillan Nicola, Gudbrandsen Maria, Brammer Michael, Giampietro Vincent, Lamar Melissa, Page Lisa, Toal Fiona, Schmitz Nicole, Cleare Anthony, Robertson Dene, Rubia Katya, Murphy Declan G M","Brain : a journal of neurology","Adolescent, Adult, Autistic Disorder, Brain, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Neural Inhibition, Photic Stimulation, Reaction Time, Serotonin, Tryptophan, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25070512","1 Sackler Institute of Translational Neurodevelopment, Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Science, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, UK eileen.daly@kcl.ac.uk.; 5 Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, Brighton, UK.; 9 Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, UK.; 4 Department of Psychiatry, University of Illinois at Chicago, USA.; 2 Department of Psychiatry, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland.; 6 Dementia Research Unit, Institute of Neurology, University College London, UK.; 8 Behavioural and Developmental Clinical Academic Group, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation.; 7 Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, UK.; 3 Department of Neuroimaging, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, UK.; 1 Sackler Institute of Translational Neurodevelopment, Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Science, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, UK.",

Our recent paper reported that oxytocin mitigated autistic behavioral deficits through the restoration of activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), as demonstrated with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a socio-communication task. However, it is unknown whether oxytocin exhibited effects at the neuronal level, which was outside of the specific task examined. In the same randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject cross-over clinical trial in which a single dose of intranasal oxytocin (24 IU) was administered to 40 men with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (UMIN000002241/000004393), we measured N-acetylaspartate (NAA) levels, a marker for neuronal energy demand, in the vmPFC using (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS). The differences in the NAA levels between the oxytocin and placebo sessions were associated with oxytocin-induced fMRI signal changes in the vmPFC. The oxytocin-induced increases in the fMRI signal could be predicted by the NAA differences between the oxytocin and placebo sessions (P=0.002), an effect that remained after controlling for variability in the time between the fMRI and (1)H-MRS scans (P=0.006) and the order of administration of oxytocin and placebo (P=0.001). Furthermore, path analysis showed that the NAA differences in the vmPFC triggered increases in the task-dependent fMRI signals in the vmPFC, which consequently led to improvements in the socio-communication difficulties associated with autism. The present study suggests that the beneficial effects of oxytocin are not limited to the autistic behavior elicited by our psychological task, but may generalize to other autistic behavioral problems associated with the vmPFC.","Aoki Y, Watanabe T, Abe O, Kuwabara H, Yahata N, Takano Y, Iwashiro N, Natsubori T, Takao H, Kawakubo Y, Kasai K, Yamasue H","Molecular psychiatry","Administration, Intranasal, Adult, Aspartic Acid, Autistic Disorder, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Image Processing, Computer-Assisted, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Oxygen, Oxytocics, Oxytocin, Prefrontal Cortex, Protons, Recovery of Function, Retrospective Studies, Time Factors, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25070538","Department of Radiology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Child Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; 1] Department of Radiology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan [2] Department of Radiology, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; 1] Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan [2] Department of Physiology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; 1] Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan [2] Japan Science and Technology Agency, CREST, Tokyo, Japan.",

Although difficulty in understanding of others' social emotions and beliefs under conditions without direct emotional cues also plays an important role in autism spectrum disorder, no study has examined the potential effect of oxytocin on this difficulty. Here, we sequentially conducted both a case-control study and a clinical trial to investigate the potential effects of oxytocin on this difficulty at behavioural and neural levels measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging during a psychological task. This task was modified from the Sally-Anne Task, a well-known first-order false belief task. The task was optimized for investigation of the abilities to infer another person's social emotions and beliefs distinctively so as to test the hypothesis that oxytocin improves deficit in inferring others' social emotions rather than beliefs, under conditions without direct emotional cues. In the case-control study, 17 males with autism spectrum disorder showed significant behavioural deficits in inferring others' social emotions (P = 0.018) but not in inferring others' beliefs (P = 0.064) compared with 17 typically developing demographically-matched male participants. They also showed significantly less activity in the right anterior insula and posterior superior temporal sulcus during inferring others' social emotions, and in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex during inferring others' beliefs compared with the typically developing participants (P < 0.001 and cluster size > 10 voxels). Then, to investigate potential effects of oxytocin on these behavioural and neural deficits, we conducted a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover within-subject trial for single-dose intranasal administration of 24 IU oxytocin in an independent group of 20 males with autism spectrum disorder. Behaviourally, oxytocin significantly increased the correct rate in inferring others' social emotions (P = 0.043, one-tail). At the neural level, the peptide significantly enhanced the originally-diminished brain activity in the right anterior insula during inferring others' social emotions (P = 0.004), but not in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex during inferring others' beliefs (P = 0.858).

One eclectic intervention (autism programming; AP) was designed specifically for children with autism and was intensive in that it was delivered for an average of 25-30 h per week (n = 16). The other eclectic intervention (generic programming; GP) was delivered to 16 children with a variety of diagnoses and needs for an average of 15-17 h per week. This paper reports outcomes for children in all three groups after two additional years of intervention. With few exceptions, the benefits of IBT documented in our first study were sustained throughout Years 2 and 3. At their final assessment, children who received IBT were more than twice as likely to score in the normal range on measures of cognitive, language, and adaptive functioning than were children who received either form of eclectic intervention. Significantly more children in the IBT group than in the other two groups had IQ, language, and adaptive behavior test scores that increased by at least one standard deviation from intake to final assessment. Although the largest improvements for children in the IBT group generally occurred during Year 1, many children in that group whose scores were below the normal range after the first year of intervention attained scores in the normal range of functioning with one or two years of additional intervention. In contrast, children in the two eclectic treatment groups were unlikely to attain scores in the normal range after the first year of intervention, and many of those who had scores in the normal range in the first year fell out of the normal range in subsequent years. There were no consistent differences in outcomes at Years 2 and 3 between the two groups who received eclectic interventions. These results provide further evidence that intensive behavior analytic intervention delivered at an early age is more likely to produce substantial improvements in young children with autism than common eclectic interventions, even when the latter are intensive.","Howard Jane S, Stanislaw Harold, Green Gina, Sparkman Coleen R, Cohen Howard G","Research in developmental disabilities","Autistic Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Child, Child, Preschool, Combined Modality Therapy, Early Intervention, Educational, Humans, Longitudinal Studies, Treatment Outcome","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25190094","California State University, Stanislaus, Psychology Department, 1 University Circle, Turlock, CA 95382, USA.

Age-matched boys with ADHD (n = 17), ASD (n = 17) and controls (n = 22) were compared using fMRI during an N-back WM task. Patients were scanned twice, under either an acute dose of fluoxetine or placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized design. Repeated-measures analyses within patients assessed drug effects on performance and brain function. To test for normalization effects of brain dysfunctions, patients under each drug condition were compared to controls. Under placebo, relative to controls, both ADHD and ASD boys shared underactivation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Fluoxetine significantly normalized the DLPFC underactivation in ASD relative to controls whereas it increased posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) deactivation in ADHD relative to control boys. Within-patient analyses showed inverse effects of fluoxetine on PCC deactivation, which it enhanced in ADHD and decreased in ASD.

The medico-economic burdens of ASD are enormous, and no recognized treatment targets the core features of ASD. In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial, young men (aged 13-27) with moderate to severe ASD received the phytochemical sulforaphane (n = 29)--derived from broccoli sprout extracts--or indistinguishable placebo (n = 15). The effects on behavior of daily oral doses of sulforaphane (50-150 µmol) for 18 wk, followed by 4 wk without treatment, were quantified by three widely accepted behavioral measures completed by parents/caregivers and physicians: the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), and Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale (CGI-I). Initial scores for ABC and SRS were closely matched for participants assigned to placebo and sulforaphane. After 18 wk, participants receiving placebo experienced minimal change (<3.3%), whereas those receiving sulforaphane showed substantial declines (improvement of behavior): 34% for ABC (P < 0.001, comparing treatments) and 17% for SRS scores (P = 0.017). On CGI-I, a significantly greater number of participants receiving sulforaphane had improvement in social interaction, abnormal behavior, and verbal communication (P = 0.015-0.007). Upon discontinuation of sulforaphane, total scores on all scales rose toward pretreatment levels. Dietary sulforaphane, of recognized low toxicity, was selected for its capacity to reverse abnormalities that have been associated with ASD, including oxidative stress and lower antioxidant capacity, depressed glutathione synthesis, reduced mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation, increased lipid peroxidation, and neuroinflammmation.","Singh Kanwaljit, Connors Susan L, Macklin Eric A, Smith Kirby D, Fahey Jed W, Talalay Paul, Zimmerman Andrew W","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","Adolescent, Adult, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Humans, Isothiocyanates, Male, Placebos, Social Behavior, Sulfoxides, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25313065","Lurie Center for Autism, Department of Pediatrics, Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, Harvard Medical School, Lexington, MA 02421;; McKusick-Nathans Institute for Genetic Medicine and.; Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Lewis B. and Dorothy Cullman Chemoprotection Center, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205 ptalalay@jhmi.edu Andrew.Zimmerman@umassmemorial.org.; Lurie Center for Autism, Department of Pediatrics, Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, Harvard Medical School, Lexington, MA 02421; Department of Pediatrics (Neurology), University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01655;; Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Lewis B. and Dorothy Cullman Chemoprotection Center, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205.; Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital Biostatistics Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114; and.; Lurie Center for Autism, Department of Pediatrics, Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, Harvard Medical School, Lexington, MA 02421; Department of Pediatrics (Neurology), University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01655; ptalalay@jhmi.edu Andrew.Zimmerman@umassmemorial.org.",

Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT) is considered an established treatment for autism spectrum disorder (ASD); however, there have been few well-controlled studies with adequate sample size. The aim of this study was to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate PRT parent training group (PRTG) for targeting language deficits in young children with ASD. Fifty-three children with autism and significant language delay between 2 and 6 years old were randomized to PRTG (N = 27) or psychoeducation group (PEG; N = 26) for 12 weeks. The PRTG taught parents behavioral techniques to facilitate language development. The PEG taught general information about ASD (clinical trial NCT01881750; http://www.clinicaltrials.gov). Analysis of child utterances during the structured laboratory observation (primary outcome) indicated that, compared with children in the PEG, children in the PRTG demonstrated greater improvement in frequency of utterances (F(2, 43) = 3.53, p = .038, d = 0.42). Results indicated that parents were able to learn PRT in a group format, as the majority of parents in the PRTG (84%) met fidelity of implementation criteria after 12 weeks. Children also demonstrated greater improvement in adaptive communication skills (Vineland-II) following PRTG and baseline Mullen visual reception scores predicted treatment response to PRTG. This is the first randomized controlled trial of group-delivered PRT and one of the largest experimental investigations of the PRT model to date. The findings suggest that specific instruction in PRT results in greater skill acquisition for both parents and children, especially in functional and adaptive communication skills. Further research in PRT is warranted to replicate the observed results and address other core ASD symptoms.","Hardan Antonio Y, Gengoux Grace W, Berquist Kari L, Libove Robin A, Ardel Christina M, Phillips Jennifer, Frazier Thomas W, Minjarez Mendy B","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","Age Factors, Autistic Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Child, Child, Preschool, Female, Humans, Language Development Disorders, Male, Parents, Treatment Outcome","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25346345","Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Center for Autism, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.; Seattle Children's Hospital/Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, WA, USA.",

Their parents (18 mothers, 11 fathers) participated in parallel Mindful Parenting training. A pre-test, post-test, and 9-week follow-up design was used. Data were analyzed using multi-level analyses. Attendance rate was 88% for adolescents and fathers and 86% for mothers. Adolescents reported an increase in quality of life and a decrease in rumination, but no changes in worry, autism spectrum disorder core symptoms, or mindful awareness. Although parents reported no change in adolescent's autism spectrum disorder core symptoms, they reported improved social responsiveness, social communication, social cognition, preoccupations, and social motivation. About themselves, parents reported improvement in general as well as in parental mindfulness. They reported improved competence in parenting, overall parenting styles, more specifically a less lax, verbose parenting style, and an increased quality of life.

Participants in the randomized controlled trial included 82 children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder at 16 to 20 months. Children were matched on pretreatment nonverbal developmental level and pairs were randomly assigned to treatment condition. Child outcomes included measures of social communication, autism symptoms, adaptive behavior, and developmental level. Child outcomes are reported from baseline to the end of the 9-month interventions. Children in individual-ESI showed differential change on a standardized examiner-administered observational measure of social communication, as they improved at a faster rate than children in group-ESI. Individual-ESI also showed differential efficacy on a parent report measure of communication, daily living, and social skills, as they showed improvement or stability, whereas group-ESI led to worsening or no significant change on these skills. Finally, individual-ESI showed differential change on examiner-administered measures of receptive language skills, as children in individual-ESI improved significantly, whereas group-ESI showed no change. These findings support the efficacy of individual-ESI compared with group-ESI on child outcomes, suggesting the importance of individualized parent coaching in natural environments. The efficacy of a parent-implemented intervention using little professional time has potential for community viability, which is particularly important in light of the lack of main effects on child outcomes of most other parent-implemented interventions.","Wetherby Amy M, Guthrie Whitney, Woods Juliann, Schatschneider Christopher, Holland Renee D, Morgan Lindee, Lord Catherine","Pediatrics","Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Community Mental Health Services, Education, Nonprofessional, Evidence-Based Practice, Female, Florida, Follow-Up Studies, Home Care Services, Humans, Infant, Interpersonal Relations, Male, Michigan, Psychotherapy, Group","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25367544","Autism Institute, Psychology, Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida; and.; Departments of Clinical Sciences, Autism Institute.; Departments of Clinical Sciences, Autism Institute, amy.wetherby@med.fsu.edu.; Psychology, Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida; and.; Autism Institute, School of Communication Science and Disorders, and.; Department of Psychiatry, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.; Autism Institute.",

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) identified brain responses during a biological motion perception task conducted prior to and following 16 weeks of PRT treatment. Overall, the neural systems supporting social perception in these 10 children were malleable through implementation of PRT; following treatment, neural responses were more similar to those of typically developing children (TD). However, at baseline, half of the children exhibited hypoactivation, relative to a group of TD children, in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), and half exhibited hyperactivation in this region. Strikingly, the groups exhibited differential neural responses to treatment: The five children who exhibited hypoactivation at baseline evidenced increased activation in components of the reward system including the ventral striatum and putamen. The five children who exhibited hyperactivation at baseline evidenced decreased activation in subcortical regions critical for regulating the flow of stimulation and conveying signals of salience to the cortex-the thalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus. Our results support further investigation into the differential effects of particular treatment strategies relative to specific neural targets. Identification of treatment strategies that address the patterns of neural vulnerability unique to each patient is consistent with the priority of creating individually tailored interventions customized to the behavioral and neural characteristics of a given person.","Ventola Pamela, Yang Daniel Y J, Friedman Hannah E, Oosting Devon, Wolf Julie, Sukhodolsky Denis G, Pelphrey Kevin A","Brain imaging and behavior","Autism Spectrum Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Brain Mapping, Child, Child Behavior, Child, Preschool, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Nerve Net, Treatment Outcome","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25370452","Center for Translational Developmental Neuroscience, Yale Child Study Center, Yale University, 230 South Frontage Road, PO Box 207900, New Haven, CT, 06520-7900, USA, pamela.ventola@yale.edu.",

However, most participants have been male, while previous research in our lab demonstrated sexually differentiated effects of OT and AVP on the neural response to reciprocated cooperation. Here we extend our previous work by significantly increasing the number of participants to enable the use of more stringent statistical thresholds that permit more precise localization of OT and AVP effects in the brain. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 153 men and 151 women were randomized to receive 24 IU intranasal OT, 20 IU intranasal AVP or placebo. Afterwards, they were imaged with fMRI while playing an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game with same-sex partners. Sex differences were observed for effects of OT on the neural response to reciprocated cooperation, such that OT increased the caduate/putamen response among males, whereas it decreased this response among females. Thus, 24 IU OT may increase the reward or salience of positive social interactions among men, while decreasing their reward or salience among women. Similar sex differences were also observed for AVP effects within bilateral insula and right supramarginal gyrus when a more liberal statistical threshold was employed. While our findings support previous suggestions that exogenous nonapeptides may be effective treatments for disorders such as depression and autism spectrum disorder, they caution against uniformly extending such treatments to men and women alike.","Feng Chunliang, Hackett Patrick D, DeMarco Ashley C, Chen Xu, Stair Sabrina, Haroon Ebrahim, Ditzen Beate, Pagnoni Giuseppe, Rilling James K","Brain imaging and behavior","Administration, Intranasal, Adolescent, Brain, Brain Mapping, Cerebrovascular Circulation, Cooperative Behavior, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Oxygen, Oxytocin, Prisoner Dilemma, Psychotropic Drugs, Reward, Sex Characteristics, Vasopressins, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25416642","Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.; Department of Psychology, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA.; Department of Anthropology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.; Department of Neural, Biomedical, and Metabolic Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.; Department of Anthropology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA. jrillin@emory.edu.",

School playground staff in the IT group showed increased behaviors aimed at improving peer engagement for children with ASD compared to playground staff at the WL sites. These improvements did not maintain to follow-up. These results suggest that a low dose, brief intervention can be beneficial in increasing peer engagement for children with autism in inclusive settings, but continued support of playground staff is likely needed.","Kretzmann Mark, Shih Wendy, Kasari Connie","Behavior therapy","Autistic Disorder, Child, Child Behavior, Child, Preschool, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Neuropsychological Tests, Peer Group, Play and Playthings, Schools, Social Behavior, Socioeconomic Factors","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25526832","University of California, Los Angeles.; University of California, Los Angeles.

Serotonin agonists modulate motor response inhibition and have shown positive behavioural effects in both disorders. We therefore used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the so far unknown shared and disorder-specific inhibitory brain dysfunctions in these two disorders, as well as the effects of a single dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. Age-matched boys with ADHD (18), ASD (19) and healthy controls (25) were compared with fMRI during a stop task measuring motor inhibition. Patients were scanned twice, under either an acute dose of fluoxetine or placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised design. Repeated measures analyses within patients assessed drug effects. To test for potential normalisation effects of brain dysfunctions, patients under each drug condition were compared to controls. Under placebo, relative to controls, ASD boys showed overactivation in left and right inferior frontal cortex (IFC), while ADHD boys showed disorder-specific underactivation in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and basal ganglia. Under fluoxetine, the prefrontal dysfunctions were no longer observed, due to inverse effects of fluoxetine on these activations: fluoxetine downregulated IFC and OFC activation in ASD but upregulated them in ADHD. The findings show that fluoxetine normalises frontal lobe dysfunctions in both disorders via inverse effects, downregulating abnormally increased frontal activation in ASD and upregulating abnormally decreased frontal activation in ADHD, potentially reflecting inverse baseline serotonin levels in both disorders.","Chantiluke Kaylita, Barrett Nadia, Giampietro Vincent, Santosh Paramala, Brammer Michael, Simmons Andrew, Murphy Declan G, Rubia Katya","Psychopharmacology","Adolescent, Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation, Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Basal Ganglia, Child, Double-Blind Method, Fluoxetine, Frontal Lobe, Humans, Inhibition, Psychological, Intelligence, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Movement, Prefrontal Cortex, Psychomotor Performance","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25533997","Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry/MRC Center for Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry (SGDP), Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, 16 De Crespigny Park, PO46, London, SE5 8AF, UK.",

When the data were combined across both groups, however, significant improvements in primary outcome measures were observed (P < 0.05). Although not statistically significant, it was considered clinically significant that participants in the OC arm demonstrated more increases in dietary variety (mean difference 3.3 foods, 95% confidence interval -0.1 to 6.8, P = 0.06) compared with the SysD arm. There were limited differences in response observed between the autism spectrum disorder and nonmedically complex history groups, and the intensive and weekly arms.

Oxytocin has been widely reported to affect social-communicative function and its neural underpinnings. Here we report the first evidence that intranasal oxytocin administration improves a core problem that individuals with autism have in using eye contact appropriately in real-world social settings. A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design is used to examine how intranasal administration of 24 IU of oxytocin affects gaze behavior for 32 adult males with autism and 34 controls in a real-time interaction with a researcher. This interactive paradigm bypasses many of the limitations encountered with conventional static or computer-based stimuli. Eye movements are recorded using eye tracking, providing an objective measurement of looking patterns. The measure is shown to be sensitive to the reduced eye contact commonly reported in autism, with the autism group spending less time looking to the eye region of the face than controls. Oxytocin administration selectively enhanced gaze to the eyes in both the autism and control groups (transformed mean eye-fixation difference per second=0.082; 95% CI:0.025-0.14, P=0.006). Within the autism group, oxytocin has the most effect on fixation duration in individuals with impaired levels of eye contact at baseline (Cohen's d=0.86). These findings demonstrate that the potential benefits of oxytocin in autism extend to a real-time interaction, providing evidence of a therapeutic effect in a key aspect of social communication.","Auyeung B, Lombardo M V, Heinrichs M, Chakrabarti B, Sule A, Deakin J B, Bethlehem R A I, Dickens L, Mooney N, Sipple J A N, Thiemann P, Baron-Cohen S","Translational psychiatry","Administration, Intranasal, Adolescent, Adult, Asperger Syndrome, Autistic Disorder, Case-Control Studies, Double-Blind Method, Eye Movement Measurements, Fixation, Ocular, Humans, Interpersonal Relations, Male, Middle Aged, Oxytocics, Oxytocin, Social Behavior, Social Skills, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25668435","Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.; 1] Department of Psychology, Laboratory for Biological and Personality Psychology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany [2] Freiburg Brain Imaging Center, University Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.; 1] Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK [2] School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences, University of Reading, Whiteknights, Reading, UK.; 1] Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK [2] Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT), Cambridge, UK.; 1] Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK [2] Department of Psychology, University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus [3] Center for Applied Neuroscience, University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus.; 1] Department of Psychology, The School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK [2] Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.; 1] Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK [2] Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT), Cambridge, UK.; South Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, Bedford, UK.",

The search for psychotherapeutic options for autistic individuals is imperative considering the lack of effective conventional treatments for mental health diagnoses that are common in this population. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) involving the administration of MDMA in clinical trials have been rare and non-life threatening. To date, MDMA has been administered to over 1133 individuals for research purposes without the occurrence of unexpected drug-related SAEs that require expedited reporting per FDA regulations. Now that safety parameters for limited use of MDMA in clinical settings have been established, a case can be made to further develop MDMA-assisted therapeutic interventions that could support autistic adults in increasing social adaptability among the typically developing population. As in the case with classic hallucinogens and other psychedelic drugs, MDMA catalyzes shifts toward openness and introspection that do not require ongoing administration to achieve lasting benefits. This infrequent dosing mitigates adverse event frequency and improves the risk/benefit ratio of MDMA, which may provide a significant advantage over medications that require daily dosing. Consequently, clinicians could employ new treatment models for social anxiety or similar types of distress administering MDMA on one to several occasions within the context of a supportive and integrative psychotherapy protocol.","Danforth Alicia L, Struble Christopher M, Yazar-Klosinski Berra, Grob Charles S","Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry","Adult, Anxiety Disorders, Autistic Disorder, Double-Blind Method, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, N-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, Patient Selection, Pilot Projects, Prospective Studies, Psychotropic Drugs, Research Design, Social Perception","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25818246","Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute, Torrance, CA, United States.

Participants included 86 toddlers (range 22-36 months) with ASD and their primary caregiver. Caregiver-child dyads were randomized to receive 10 weeks of hands-on parent training in a naturalistic, developmental behavioral intervention (joint attention, symbolic play, engagement and regulation-JASPER) or a parent-only psychoeducational intervention (PEI). Dose was controlled in terms of researcher-parent contact and early intervention services received by the child. Results yielded significant effects of the JASPER intervention on the primary outcome of joint engagement. The treatment effect was large (Cohen's f² = .69) and maintained over the 6-month follow-up. JASPER effects were also found on secondary outcomes of play diversity, highest play level achieved, and generalization to the child's classroom for child-initiated joint engagement. The PEI intervention was found to be effective in reducing parenting stress associated with child characteristics. All secondary effects were generally small to moderate. These data highlight the benefit of a brief, targeted, parent-mediated intervention on child outcomes.

Empirically supported psychosocial interventions exist, yet access is limited, especially for families in rural areas. Telehealth (i.e. videoconferencing) has potential to reduce barriers to access to care; however, little is known about the feasibility or efficacy of directly intervening with youth with autism spectrum disorders through this modality. This study details the pilot testing of a telehealth version of an empirically supported intervention targeting anxiety in youth with autism spectrum disorders. The primary focus of this study is on feasibility, with evaluation of outcomes as a starting point for future randomized trials. In all, 33 families of youth with autism spectrum disorders and significant anxiety symptoms participated in this study (Telehealth Facing Your Fears (FYF) Intervention: n = 17; Wait-list control: n = 16). Youth of all functioning levels were included. Acceptability was strong; however, the usability of the technology was problematic for some families and impeded some sessions significantly. Fidelity of the telehealth version to the critical elements of the original, in vivo version was excellent. More work is needed to improve delivery of exposure practices and parent coaching. Preliminary efficacy analyses are promising, with improvements observed in youth anxiety over time (relative to a comparison group waiting for live intervention) and parent sense of competence (within group). Clearly, stronger designs are necessary to evaluate efficacy sufficiently; however, this study does provide support for further investigation of clinic-to-home videoconferencing as a direct intervention tool for youth with autism spectrum disorders and their parents.","Hepburn Susan L, Blakeley-Smith Audrey, Wolff Brian, Reaven Judy A","Autism : the international journal of research and practice","Anxiety Disorders, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Feasibility Studies, Female, Humans, Male, Pilot Projects, Telemedicine","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25896267","University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, USA susan.hepburn@ucdenver.edu.; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, USA.; University of Denver, USA.",

Behavioral interventions are used to treat disruptive behavior but have not been evaluated in large-scale randomized trials. To evaluate the efficacy of parent training for children with autism spectrum disorder and disruptive behavior. This 24-week randomized trial compared parent training (n = 89) to parent education (n = 91) at 6 centers (Emory University, Indiana University, Ohio State University, University of Pittsburgh, University of Rochester, Yale University). We screened 267 children; 180 children (aged 3-7 years) with autism spectrum disorder and disruptive behaviors were randomly assigned (86% white, 88% male) between September 2010 and February 2014. Parent training (11 core, 2 optional sessions; 2 telephone boosters; 2 home visits) provided specific strategies to manage disruptive behavior. Parent education (12 core sessions, 1 home visit) provided information about autism but no behavior management strategies. Parents rated disruptive behavior and noncompliance on co-primary outcomes: the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability subscale (range, 0-45) and the Home Situations Questionnaire-Autism Spectrum Disorder (range, 0-9). On both measures, higher scores indicate greater severity and a 25% reduction indicates clinical improvement. A clinician blind to treatment assignment rated the Improvement scale of the Clinical Global Impression (range, 1-7), a secondary outcome, with a positive response less than 3. At week 24, the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability subscale declined 47.7% in parent training (from 23.7 to 12.4) compared with 31.8% for parent education (23.9 to 16.3) (treatment effect, -3.9; 95% CI, -6.2 to -1.7; P < .001, standardized effect size = 0.62). The Home Situations Questionnaire-Autism Spectrum Disorder declined 55% (from 4.0 to 1.8) compared with 34.2% in parent education (3.8 to 2.5) (treatment effect, -0.7; 95% CI, -1.1 to -0.3; P < .001, standardized effect size = 0.45). Neither measure met the prespecified minimal clinically important difference. The proportions with a positive response on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale were 68.5% for parent training vs 39.6% for parent education (P < .001). For children with autism spectrum disorder, a 24-week parent training program was superior to parent education for reducing disruptive behavior on parent-reported outcomes, although the clinical significance of the improvement is unclear.

Evidence from a transcranial magnetic stimulation study.","2015-10-01","Virtual lesions in the mirror neuron network using inhibitory low-frequency (1Hz) transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have been employed to understand its spatio-functional properties. However, no studies have examined the influence of neuro-enhancement by using excitatory high-frequency (20Hz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) on these networks. We used three forms of TMS stimulation (HF-rTMS, single and paired pulse) to investigate whether the mirror neuron system facilitates the motor system during goal-directed action observation relative to inanimate motion (motor resonance), a marker of putative mirror neuron activity. 31 healthy individuals were randomized to receive single-sessions of true or sham HF-rTMS delivered to the left inferior frontal gyrus - a component of the human mirror system. Motor resonance was assessed before and after HF-rTMS using three TMS cortical reactivity paradigms: (a) 120% of resting motor threshold (RMT), (b) stimulus intensity set to evoke motor evoked potential of 1-millivolt amplitude (SI1mV) and (c) a short latency paired pulse paradigm. Two-way RMANOVA showed a significant group (true versus sham) X occasion (pre- and post-HF-rTMS motor resonance) interaction effect for SI1mV [F(df)=6.26 (1, 29), p=0.018] and 120% RMT stimuli [F(df)=7.01 (1, 29), p=0.013] indicating greater enhancement of motor resonance in the true HF-rTMS group than the sham-group. This suggests that HF-rTMS could adaptively modulate properties of the mirror neuron system. This neuro-enhancement effect is a preliminary step that can open translational avenues for novel brain stimulation therapeutics targeting social-cognition deficits in schizophrenia and autism.","Mehta Urvakhsh Meherwan, Waghmare Avinash V, Thirthalli Jagadisha, Venkatasubramanian Ganesan, Gangadhar Bangalore N","Asian journal of psychiatry","Adult, Autistic Disorder, Electromyography, Evoked Potentials, Motor, Female, Healthy Volunteers, Humans, Male, Mirror Neurons, Neuronal Plasticity, Prefrontal Cortex, Schizophrenia, Task Performance and Analysis, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26194133","Department of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health & Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore 560029, India.; Department of Psychiatry, Smt.

Sixty children diagnosed with autism according to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) criteria (mean age of 4.5 years) were randomly divided into two groups: A single treatment group (n=28) and a combined treatment group (n=32). The combined treatment group received ABA training combined with oral bumetanide (0.5 mg twice a day). The single treatment group received ABA training only. Autism symptoms were evaluated with the Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), whereas severity of disease (SI) and global improvement (GI) were measured with the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI). Assessment of ABC, CARS, and CGI was performed immediately before and 3 months after initiation of the treatment(s). Prior to intervention(s) no statistically significant differences in scores on the ABC, CARS, SI, or GI were found between the two groups. Total scores of the ABC, CARS, and SI were decreased in both groups after 3 months (p<0.05) compared with the scores prior to treatment. The total scores of the ABC and the CGI were significantly (p<0.05) lower in the combined treatment group than in the single treatment group. Although the total and item scores of the CARS in the combined treatment group were lower than in the single treatment group after a 3 month intervention, they did not reach statistical significance. No adverse effects of bumetanide were observed.

Less is known about the long-term effects of risperidone exposure in this population. We examined the tolerability, safety, and therapeutic benefit of risperidone exposure over a 1-2 year follow-up period. In a naturalistic study, 84 children and adolescents 5-17 years of age (from an original sample of 101) were assessed an average of 21.4 months after initial entry into a placebo-controlled 8 week trial of risperidone for children and adolescents with autism and severe irritability. They were assessed at baseline and at follow-up on safety and tolerability measures (blood, urinalysis, electrocardiogram [ECG], medical history, vital signs, neurological symptoms, other adverse events), developmental measures (adaptive behavior, intelligence quotient [IQ]), and standardized rating instruments. Treatment over the follow-up period, after completion of protocol participation, was uncontrolled. Statistical analyses assessed outcome over time with or without prolonged risperidone therapy. Two-thirds of the 84 subjects continued to receive risperidone (mean 2.47 mg/day, S.D. 1.29 mg). At follow-up, risperidone was associated with more enuresis, more excessive appetite, and more weight gain, but not more adverse neurological effects. No clinically significant events were noted on blood counts, chemistries, urinalysis, ECG, or interim medical history. Regardless of drug condition at follow-up, there was considerable improvement in maladaptive behavior compared with baseline, including core symptoms associated with autism. Height and weight gains were elevated with risperidone. Social skills on Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS) improved with risperidone. Parent-rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) Irritability subscale scores were reduced in those taking risperidone at follow-up. Several other measures of maladaptive behavior (some related to socialization) also showed improved functioning in association with risperidone on the ABC or on the Modified Real Life Rating Scale. Increased appetite, weight gain, and enuresis are risks associated with long-term risperidone.

"26336909","10.1093/Brain/Awv249","Clinical and neural effects of six-week administration of oxytocin on core symptoms of autism.","2015-11-01","Autism spectrum disorder is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder with no established pharmacological treatment for its core symptoms. Although previous literature has shown that single-dose administration of oxytocin temporally mitigates autistic social behaviours in experimental settings, it remains in dispute whether such potentially beneficial responses in laboratories can result in clinically positive effects in daily life situations, which are measurable only in long-term observations of individuals with the developmental disorder undergoing continual oxytocin administration. Here, to address this issue, we performed an exploratory, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial including 20 high-functional adult males with autism spectrum disorder. Data obtained from 18 participants who completed the trial showed that 6-week intranasal administration of oxytocin significantly reduced autism core symptoms specific to social reciprocity, which was clinically evaluated by Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (P = 0.034, PFDR < 0.05, Cohen's d = 0.78). Critically, the improvement of this clinical score was accompanied by oxytocin-induced enhancement of task-independent resting-state functional connectivity between anterior cingulate cortex and dorso-medial prefrontal cortex (rho = -0.60, P = 0.011), which was measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Moreover, using the same social-judgement task as used in our previous single-dose oxytocin trial, we confirmed that the current continual administration also significantly mitigated behavioural and neural responses during the task, both of which were originally impaired in autistic individuals (judgement tendency: P = 0.019, d = 0.62; eye-gaze effect: P = 0.03, d = 0.56; anterior cingulate activity: P = 0.00069, d = 0.97; dorso-medial prefrontal activity: P = 0.0014, d = 0.92; all, PFDR < 0.05). Furthermore, despite its longer administration, these effect sizes of the 6-week intervention were not larger than those seen in our previous single-dose intervention. These findings not only provide the evidence for clinically beneficial effects of continual oxytocin administration on the core social symptoms of autism spectrum disorder with suggesting its underlying biological mechanisms, but also highlight the necessity to seek optimal regimens of continual oxytocin treatment in future studies.","Watanabe Takamitsu, Kuroda Miho, Kuwabara Hitoshi, Aoki Yuta, Iwashiro Norichika, Tatsunobu Natsubori, Takao Hidemasa, Nippashi Yasumasa, Kawakubo Yuki, Kunimatsu Akira, Kasai Kiyoto, Yamasue Hidenori","Brain : a journal of neurology","Administration, Intranasal, Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Brain, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Functional Neuroimaging, Gyrus Cinguli, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Neural Pathways, Oxytocics, Oxytocin, Prefrontal Cortex, Social Behavior, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26336909","5 Department of Radiology, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.; 1 Department of Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.; 4 Department of Child Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.; 1 Department of Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan 2 Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan 3 Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, 17 Queen Square, London, WC1N 3AR, UK.; 1 Department of Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan 6 Japan Science and Technology Agency, CREST, 5 Sambancho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 102-0075, Japan yamasue-tky@umin.ac.jp.",

Our secondary hypothesis was that the usual doses of zuclopenthixol and/or clonazepam would decrease in the venlafaxine-treated group. In a randomized double-blind study, we compared six patients who received venlafaxine along with their usual treatment (zuclopenthixol and/or clonazepam) with seven patients who received placebo plus usual care. Irritability, hyperactivity/noncompliance, and overall clinical improvement were measured after 2 and 8 weeks, using validated clinical scales. Univariate analyses showed that the symptom of irritability improved in the entire sample (p = 0.023 after 2 weeks, p = 0.061 at study endpoint), although no difference was observed between the venlafaxine and placebo groups. No significant decrease in hyperactivity/noncompliance was observed during the study. At the end of the study, global improvement was observed in 33% of participants treated with venlafaxine and in 71% of participants in the placebo group (p = 0.29). The study found that decreased cumulative doses of clonazepam and zuclopenthixol were required for the venlafaxine group. Multivariate analyses (principal component analyses) with at least three combinations of variables showed that the two populations could be clearly separated (p b 0.05). Moreover, in all cases, the venlafaxine population had lower values for the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Behavior Problems Inventory (BPI), and levels of urea with respect to the placebo group. In one case, a reduction in the dosage of clonazepam was also suggested. For an additional set of variables (ABC factor 2, BPI frequency of aggressive behaviors, hematic ammonia at Day 28, and zuclopenthixol and clonazepam intake), the separation between the two samples was statistically significant as was the Bartlett's test, but the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy was below the accepted threshold. This set of variables showed a reduction in the cumulative intake of both zuclopenthixol and clonazepam. Despite the small sample sizes, this study documented a statistically significant effect of venlafaxine. Moreover, we showed that lower doses of zuclopenthixol and clonazepam were needed in the venlafaxine group, although this difference was not statistically significant. This was confirmed by multivariate analyses, where this difference reached statistical significance when using a combination of variables involving zuclopenthixol.

The objectives of this meta-analysis are to identify the pooled placebo response and the predictors of placebo response in pharmacological and dietary supplement treatment trials for participants with a diagnosis of ASD. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in pediatric ASD, conducted between 1980 and August 2014, were identified through a search of Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and clinicaltrials.gov. RCTs of at least 14 days duration, comparing the treatment response for an oral active agent and placebo using at least one of the common outcome measures, were included. Analysis of 25 data sets (1315 participants) revealed a moderate effect size for overall placebo response (Hedges' g=0.45, 95% confidence interval (0.34-0.56), P<0.001).

We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled study involving 101 subjects and analyzed the effect of intranasal OXT on consumers' attribution of relationship qualities to brands, brands paired with human celebrity endorsers, and familiar persons. OXT indeed promoted the attribution of relationship qualities not only in the case of social and semi-social stimuli, but also brands. Intriguingly, for subjects scoring high on autistic-like traits, the effect of OXT was completely reversed, evident in even lower relationship qualities across all stimulus categories. The importance of OXT in a CBR context is further corroborated by a three-fold increase in endogenous release of OXT following exposure to one's favorite brand and positive associations between baseline peripheral OXT concentrations and brand relationship qualities. Collectively, our findings indicate that OXT not only plays a fundamental role in developing interpersonal relationships, but also enables relationship formation with objects such as brands.","Fürst Andreas, Thron Jesko, Scheele Dirk, Marsh Nina, Hurlemann René","Scientific reports","Administration, Intranasal, Adult, Analysis of Variance, Autistic Disorder, Codependency, Psychological, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Interpersonal Relations, Male, Neuropeptides, Oxytocin, Psychomotor Performance, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26449882","Department of Marketing, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), 90403 Nürnberg, Germany and Professorial Fellow of the Business School at the University of Eastern Finland (UEF), 70211 Kuopio, Finland.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Bonn, 53105 Bonn, Germany.",

Thirty-one children with autism received 12 International Units (IU) of oxytocin and placebo nasal spray morning and night (24 IU per day) for 5 weeks, with a 4-week washout period between each treatment. Compared with placebo, oxytocin led to significant improvements on the primary outcome of caregiver-rated social responsiveness. Overall, nasal spray was well tolerated, and the most common reported adverse events were thirst, urination and constipation. This study is the first clinical trial to support the potential of oxytocin as an early intervention for young children with autism to help improve social interaction deficits.","Yatawara C J, Einfeld S L, Hickie I B, Davenport T A, Guastella A J","Molecular psychiatry","Administration, Intranasal, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Interpersonal Relations, Male, Nasal Sprays, Oxytocin, Social Behavior, Treatment Outcome","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26503762","Autism Clinic for Translational Research, Brain and Mind Centre, Central Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Brain and Mind Centre, Central Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",

However, considerable variability exists in individual responses to oxytocin administration. Here, we undertook a study to investigate the role of genetic variation in sensitivity to exogenous oxytocin using a socioemotional task. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled experiment with a repeated-measures (crossover) design, we assessed the performance of 203 men on an emotion recognition task under oxytocin and placebo. We took a haplotype-based approach to investigate the association between oxytocin receptor gene variation and oxytocin sensitivity. We identified a six-marker haplotype block spanning the promoter region and intron 3 that was significantly associated with our measure of oxytocin sensitivity. Specifically, the TTCGGG haplotype comprising single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs237917-rs2268498-rs4564970-rs237897-rs2268495-rs53576 is associated with increased emotion recognition performance under oxytocin versus placebo, and the CCGAGA haplotype with the opposite pattern.

However, ADHD response to stimulants is well below rates in typically developing children, with frequent side effects. Group studies of treatments for noncompliance are rare in ASD. We examined individual and combined-effectiveness of atomoxetine (ATX) and parent training (PT) for ADHD symptoms and noncompliance. In a 3-site, 10-week, double-blind, 2 × 2 trial of ATX and PT, 128 children (ages 5-14 years) with ASD and ADHD symptoms were randomized to ATX, ATX+PT, placebo+PT, or placebo. ATX was adjusted to optimal dose (capped at 1.8 mg/kg/day) over 6 weeks and maintained for 4 additional weeks. Nine PT sessions were provided. Primary outcome measures were the parent-rated DSM ADHD symptoms on the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham (SNAP) scale and Home Situations Questionnaire (HSQ). On the SNAP, ATX, ATX+PT and placebo+PT were each superior to placebo (effect sizes 0.57-0.98; p values of .0005, .0004, and .025, respectively). For noncompliance, ATX and ATX+PT were superior to placebo (effect sizes 0.47-0.64; p values .03 and .0028, respectively). ATX was associated with decreased appetite but was otherwise well tolerated. Both ATX and PT resulted in significant improvement on ADHD symptoms, whereas ATX (both alone and combined with PT) was associated with significant decreases on measures of noncompliance.

One reason for therapeutic failure or adverse effects is caused by genetic variations in the cytochrome P450 drug-metabolizing genes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of CYP2D6 polymorphisms on steady-state serum concentrations of antipsychotics metabolized by CYP2D6, taking into account the co-medication with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Serum and EDTA samples were collected from 82 psychiatric patients. After a liquid-liquid extraction, serum samples were analyzed using an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (UHPLC-MS/MS) method for quantification of the antipsychotics. CYP2D6 genotyping was performed using the Luminex xTAG® CYP2D6 Kit v3 (Luminex Corporation). Patients were divided into five phenotype subgroups by calculation of the activity score (AS): poor metabolizers (PM; AS 0), intermediate metabolizers (IM; AS 0.5-1), extensive metabolizers with slow activity (EM-s; AS 1-1.5), extensive metabolizers with fast activity (EM-f; AS 2), and ultra-rapid metabolizers (UM; AS >2). The influence of the phenotypes on the concentration-to-dose and metabolite-to-parent ratios was evaluated. Overall, 6.1 % UM (n = 5), 25.6 % EM-f (n = 21), 46.3 % EM-s (n = 38), 1.2 % EM-s/EM-f (n = 1), 6.1 % IM (n = 5), and 14.6 % PM (n = 12) were found, taking co-administration of strong and moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors into account (phenoconversion). It was demonstrated that CYP2D6 polymorphisms affect the serum concentrations of aripiprazole (n = 18), haloperidol (n = 11), risperidone (n = 20), and zuclopenthixol (n = 6), while no influence was seen on the paliperidone serum concentrations (n = 31).

This study tests the relationship between isolated core components of a packaged social communication intervention and the primary outcome, joint engagement, to better understand how the intervention is affecting change in individuals. A total of 86 toddlers and their parents were enrolled in the study and randomized to one of two treatments, the joint attention, symbolic play, engagement, and regulation (JASPER) parent-mediated intervention or a psychoeducational intervention. Measures regarding the parent's use of intervention strategies were collected before and after the 10-week intervention. Additional measures of child and parent joint engagement were also collected. A significant effect of treatment was found for all four of the core strategies of the intervention, favoring a larger increase in the JASPER condition. A hierarchical linear regression revealed several individual predictors of joint engagement, including parent-rated buy-in, interventionist-rated parent involvement, and parental use of strategies. To complement the hierarchical analysis, we also tested the potential mediating effect the strategies may have on the relationship between treatment and joint engagement. Results showed that the strategy of mirrored pacing mediated the relationship between treatment and joint engagement in the positive direction.

The goal is to effectuate a behavioural modification by modulating brain activity. The EEG NF opens new therapeutic possibilities in the fields of psychiatry and neurology. However, the development of EEG NF in clinical practice requires (i) a good level of evidence of therapeutic efficacy of this technique, (ii) a good practice guide for this technique. Firstly, this article investigates selected trials with the following criteria: study design with controlled, randomized, and open or blind protocol, primary endpoint related to the mental and brain disorders treated and assessed with standardized measurement tools, identifiable EEG neurophysiological targets, underpinned by pathophysiological relevance. Trials were found for: epilepsies, migraine, stroke, chronic insomnia, attentional-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, addictive disorders, psychotic disorders. Secondly, this article investigates the principles of neurofeedback therapy in line with learning theory. Different underlying therapeutic models are presented didactically between two continua: a continuum between implicit and explicit learning and a continuum between the biomedical model (centred on ""the disease"") and integrative biopsychosocial model of health (centred on ""the illness""). The main relevant learning model is to link neurofeedback therapy with the field of cognitive remediation techniques. The methodological specificity of neurofeedback is to be guided by biologically relevant neurophysiological parameters. Guidelines for good clinical practice of EEG NF concerning technical issues of electrophysiology and of learning are suggested. These require validation by institutional structures for the clinical practice of EEG NF.","Micoulaud-Franchi J-A, McGonigal A, Lopez R, Daudet C, Kotwas I, Bartolomei F","Neurophysiologie clinique = Clinical neurophysiology","Brain Diseases, Electroencephalography, Evidence-Based Medicine, Humans, Mental Disorders, Neurofeedback","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26553293","Service d'explorations fonctionnelles du système nerveux, clinique du sommeil, CHU de Bordeaux, place Amélie-Raba-Léon, 33076 Bordeaux, France; USR CNRS 3413 SANPSY, CHU Pellegrin, université de Bordeaux, 33076 Bordeaux, France.

The modification of CBT in this study consists of focusing on CBT protocols for anxiety disorders and depression, while visualizing and systematizing ""the invisible"" in the conversation, in order for the clients to understand the social, cognitive and emotional context of self and others and how they should interact to avoid misunderstandings. ASD clients may need help to detect the invisible code of social interaction and communication. The level of anxiety and the frequency of target behavior were measured. Four assessments were made, two at the pre-assessment, and one in mid-therapy and end of therapy respectively. Generally, results suggest no improvement during pre-treatment period but a significant improvement during treatment. The values of the clients' psychological, social and occupational ability to function improved on the Global Function Rating scale.

Growing public concern and refusal to vaccinate poses a serious public health risk. Evaluations of recent pro-vaccine health communication interventions have revealed mixed results (at best).

American adults (N = 206) were invited participate in an online survey experiment. Participants were randomly assigned to either a control group or to one of three treatment interventions. The treatment messages were based on expert-consensus estimates and either normatively described or prescribed the extant medical consensus: ""90 % of medical scientists agree that vaccines are safe and that all parents should be required to vaccinate their children"". Compared to the control group, the consensus-messages significantly reduced vaccine concern (M = 3.51 vs. M = 2.93, p < 0.01) and belief in the vaccine-autism-link (M = 3.07 vs M = 2.15, p < 0.01) while increasing perceived consensus about vaccine safety (M = 83.93 vs M = 89.80, p < 0.01) and public support for vaccines (M = 5.66 vs M = 6.22, p < 0.01). Mediation analysis further revealed that the public's understanding of the level of scientific agreement acts as an important ""gateway"" belief by promoting public attitudes and policy support for vaccines directly as well as indirectly by reducing endorsement of the discredited autism-vaccine link. These findings suggest that emphasizing the medical consensus about (childhood) vaccine safety is likely to be an effective pro-vaccine message that could help prevent current immunization rates from declining.

Data from 36 participants from a recent evaluation of the SibworkS programme was used. Measures were administered pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention and three months post-intervention. Treatment effects were measured using change scores for siblings on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire - Parent Version (SDQ). Seven predictors were analysed: symptom severity of the child with special needs, participant age and gender, sibling birth order, family socio-economic status, participant baseline SDQ score and participant use of additional support services. The overall model significantly predicted change in SDQ scores at post-intervention and follow-up (adjusted R(2) = 0.41 and 0.40). At both evaluation points, SDQ change scores were significantly predicted by baseline SDQ score. Furthermore, symptom severity of the child with special needs was a significant predictor at three months post-intervention. Poorer emotional and behavioural functioning among participants and symptom severity of the child with special needs were associated with greater intervention effects. These results indicate that SibworkS is likely to be beneficial for siblings who have difficulties adjusting, and siblings of children with more severe special needs. Implications for Rehabilitation Siblings of children with disability are at increased risk of emotional and behavioural difficulties. Sibworks is a manualised group-based intervention for the siblings of children with a disability. Poorer emotional and behavioural functioning among participants and symptom severity of the child with special needs were associated with greater intervention effects.

The primary objective was to evaluate the effects of 24 weeks of buspirone on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) Composite Total Score. Secondary objectives included evaluating the effects of buspirone on social competence, repetitive behaviors, language, sensory dysfunction, and anxiety and to assess side effects. Positron emission tomography measures of tryptophan metabolism and blood serotonin concentrations were assessed as predictors of buspirone efficacy. There was no difference in the ADOS Composite Total Score between baseline and 24 weeks among the 3 treatment groups (P = .400); however, the ADOS Restricted and Repetitive Behavior score showed a time-by-treatment effect (P = .006); the 2.5-mg buspirone group showed significant improvement (P = .003), whereas placebo and 5.0-mg buspirone groups showed no change. Children in the 2.5-mg buspirone group were more likely to improve if they had fewer foci of increased brain tryptophan metabolism on positron emission tomography (P = .018) or if they showed normal levels of blood serotonin (P = .044). Adverse events did not differ significantly among treatment groups.

Topiramate has attracted considerable attention as a treatment for the dependence on alcohol and stimulants. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of topiramate for methamphetamine dependence. This study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. In the present investigation, 62 methamphetamine-dependent adults were enrolled and randomized into two groups, and received topiramate or a placebo for 10 weeks in escalating doses from 50 mg/day to the target maintenance dose of 200 mg/day. Addiction severity index (ASI) and craving scores were registered every week. The Beck questionnaire was also given to each participant at baseline and every 2 weeks during the treatment. Urine samples were collected at baseline and every 2 weeks during the treatment. Fifty-seven patients completed 10 weeks of the trial. There was no significant difference between both groups in the mean percentage of prescribed capsules taken by the participants. At week six, the topiramate group showed a significantly lower proportion of methamphetamine-positive urine tests in comparison with the placebo group (P = 0.01). In addition, there were significantly lower scores in the topiramate group in comparison with the placebo group in two domains of ASI: drug use severity (P < 0.001) and drug need (P < 0.001).

Within an ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial (NCT01854346) and based on outcome data from the Social Responsiveness Scale, six high responders and five low-to-non-responders to social skills group training and one parent of each child (N = 22) were deep interviewed. Interestingly, both high responders and low-to-non-responders (and their parents) reported improvements in social communication and related skills (e.g. awareness of own difficulties, self-confidence, independence in everyday life) and overall treatment satisfaction, although more positive intervention experiences were expressed by responders. These findings highlight the added value of collecting verbal data in addition to quantitative data in a comprehensive evaluation of social skills group training.","Choque Olsson Nora, Rautio Daniel, Asztalos Jenny, Stoetzer Ulrich, Bölte Sven","Autism : the international journal of research and practice","Adolescent, Autistic Disorder, Child, Female, Humans, Interpersonal Relations, Male, Parents, Patient Satisfaction, Psychotherapy, Group, Qualitative Research, Social Skills","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26912485","Karolinska Institutet & Swedish Work Environmental Authority, Sweden.; Stockholm County Council, Sweden.; Karolinska Institutet, Sweden Stockholm County Council, Sweden nora.choque-olsson@ki.se.; Karolinska Institutet, Sweden Stockholm County Council, Sweden.",

Neuroimaging studies have shown that superior temporal sulcus (STS) is highly implicated in eye-gaze perception. In autism, a lack of preference for the eyes, as well as anatomo-functional abnormalities within the STS, has been described. To date, there are no experimental data in humans showing whether it is possible to interfere with eye-gaze processing by modulating STS neural activity. Here, we measured eye-gaze perception before and after inhibitory transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied over the posterior STS (pSTS) in young healthy volunteers. Eye-gaze processing, namely overt orienting toward the eyes, was measured using eye tracking during passive visualization of social movies. Inhibition of the right pSTS led participants to look less to the eyes of characters during visualization of social movies. Such effect was specific for the eyes and was not observed after inhibition of the left pSTS nor after placebo TMS. These results indicate for the first time that interfering with the right pSTS neural activity transitorily disrupts the behavior of orienting toward the eyes and thus indirectly gaze perception, a fundamental process for human social cognition. These results could open up new perspectives in therapeutic interventions in autism.","Saitovitch Ana, Popa Traian, Lemaitre Hervé, Rechtman Elza, Lamy Jean-Charles, Grévent David, Calmon Raphael, Meunier Sabine, Brunelle Francis, Samson Yves, Boddaert Nathalie, Zilbovicius Monica","Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)","Cognition, Eye Movement Measurements, Female, Fixation, Ocular, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Neural Inhibition, Social Perception, Temporal Lobe, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Visual Perception, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26946130","Inserm U1127, CNRS UMR 7225, Sorbonne Universités, UPMC Univ.

In this study, the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist memantine (once-daily extended-release [ER]) were investigated in children with autism in a randomized, placebo-controlled, 12 week trial and a 48 week open-label extension. A total of 121 children 6-12 years of age with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed., Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR)-defined autistic disorder were randomized (1:1) to placebo or memantine ER for 12 weeks; 104 children entered the subsequent extension trial. Maximum memantine doses were determined by body weight and ranged from 3 to 15 mg/day. There was one serious adverse event (SAE) (affective disorder, with memantine) in the 12 week study and one SAE (lobar pneumonia) in the 48 week extension; both were deemed unrelated to treatment. Other AEs were considered mild or moderate and most were deemed not related to treatment. No clinically significant changes occurred in clinical laboratory values, vital signs, or electrocardiogram (ECG). There was no significant between-group difference on the primary efficacy outcome of caregiver/parent ratings on the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), although an improvement over baseline at Week 12 was observed in both groups. A trend for improvement at the end of the 48 week extension was observed. No improvements in the active group were observed on any of the secondary end-points, with one communication measure showing significant worsening with memantine compared with placebo (p = 0.02) after 12 weeks. This trial did not demonstrate clinical efficacy of memantine ER in autism; however, the tolerability and safety data were reassuring.

Despite the effectiveness of serotonergic compounds in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, treatment-resistant symptoms remaining in 40 to 60 % of patients present a pressing clinical problem. There are currently no medications that effectively treat the core impairments of autism spectrum disorder. There is an urgent need for the development of conceptually novel pharmacological strategies. Agents targeting glutamate neurotransmission, such as memantine, represent promising candidates. This proof-of-concept clinical study will allow pilot-testing of memantine for both clinical effectiveness and tolerability/safety. Memantine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia in a number of countries. This 12-week study has an add-on, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled design of treatment with memantine, including an up-titration phase (forced flexible dose design, 5-15 mg/day), in patients aged 6-17 years and 9 months with obsessive-compulsive disorder or autism spectrum disorder. It is planned to include patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (N = 50) or autism spectrum disorder (N = 50) across four centres in three European countries. Patients will be randomly assigned to memantine or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Primary objectives are the investigation of the effectiveness of memantine in paediatric patients for improving symptoms of compulsivity (primary outcome measure: total score on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale) and to explore its tolerability and safety. Secondary objectives are to explore the effects of memantine at the level of structure, function and biochemistry of the fronto-striatal circuits, and to collect blood for genetic analyses and biomarkers. Tertiary objectives are to explore the role of new candidate genes and pathways for compulsivity by linking genes to clinical phenotypes, response to treatment, neurocognitive test performance, and key structural and functional neuroimaging measures of the fronto-striatal circuits and to explore biomarkers/proteomics for compulsivity traits. This study is part of the large, translational project TACTICS ( http://www.tactics-project.eu/ ) that is funded by the European Union and investigates the neural, genetic and molecular factors involved in the pathogenesis of compulsivity.

The goal of this study was to evaluate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of oral N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant whose function overlaps with proposed mechanisms of ASD pathophysiology, targeting core social impairment in youth with ASD. This study was a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral NAC in youth with ASD. Study participants were medically healthy youth age 4 to 12 years with ASD, weighing ≥15 kg, and judged to be moderately ill based on the Clinical Global Impressions Severity scale. The participants were randomized via computer to active drug or placebo in a 1:1 ratio, with the target dose of NAC being 60 mg/kg/day in three divided doses. The primary outcome measure of efficacy was the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement (CGI-I) scale anchored to core social impairment. To investigate the impact of NAC on oxidative stress markers in peripheral blood, venous blood samples were collected at screen and week 12. Thirty-one patients were enrolled (NAC = 16, placebo = 15). Three participants were lost to follow-up, and three left the trial due to adverse effects. The average daily dose of NAC at week 12 was 56.2 mg/kg (SD = 9.7) with dose ranging from 33.6 to 64.3 mg/kg. The frequency of adverse events was so low that comparisons between groups could not be conducted. At week 12, there was no statistically significant difference between the NAC and placebo groups on the CGI-I (p > 0.69) but the glutathione (GSH) level in blood was significantly higher in the NAC group (p < 0.05). The oxidative glutathione disulfide (GSSG) level increased in the NAC group, however only at a trend level of significance (p = 0.09). There was no significant difference between the NAC and placebo groups in the GSH/GSSG ratio, DNA strand break and oxidative damage, and blood homocysteine levels at week 12 (ps > 0.16). The results of this trial indicate that NAC treatment was well tolerated, had the expected effect of boosting GSH production, but had no significant impact on social impairment in youth with ASD.

We monitored height, weight, waist circumference, and adverse effects during the trial. Fasting blood samples were obtained before treatment and at week 16. In 97 children with a mean of 22.9 ± 2.8 weeks of risperidone exposure, there was a 5.4 ± 3.4 kg weight gain over 24 weeks (p < .0001); waist circumference increased from 60.7 ± 10.4 cm to 66.8 ± 11.3 cm (p < .0001).

Among most mammals, the placenta is not effective at transferring antibodies to the fetus: antibodies are transferred immediately after birth via the colostrum. Among humans (and other mammals with hemochorial placentas) the transplacental transfer of antibodies (namely IgG) is effective. In humans, foetal concentrations of IgG sub-classes approximate to maternal concentrations at 38weeks and continue to increase thereafter. These facts explain inter-species differences regarding the basic needs of neonates. Among most mammals, the early colostrum is, strictly speaking, vital. Among humans, the main questions are about the bacteriological environment in the birthing place and how familiar it is to the mother. Today, most human beings are born in unfamiliar bacteriological environments characterized by a low microbial diversity. The effects of clinical environments may be amplified by the use of antibiotics and birth by caesarean, i.e. by-passing the bacteriologically rich perineal zone. There is already an accumulation of data confirming that the maturation of a balanced Th1/Th2 immune response is affected by the mode of delivery. There is also an accumulation of epidemiological studies detecting risk factors in the perinatal period for health conditions such as type 1 diabetes (and other autoimmune diseases), atopy, autism and obesity. In such a context there are reasons to plan randomized controlled trials with long term follow-up of the effects of BCG given immediately after birth, as a modulator of Th-1/Th-2 responses. A follow-up period in the region of 6-10years would be long enough to evaluate the prevalence of several nosologically well defined diseases. These studies would be ethically acceptable, since BCG is the only infancy vaccine that has been evaluated through randomised controlled trials with long term follow-up. Furthermore, whatever the standard of living of the populations and the research protocols, concordant results suggest that BCG has positive non-specific long term effects on health. Meanwhile, some simple adaptive practices are possible, such as, after a caesarean section, wrapping the neonate in clothes recently worn by the mother and, occasionally, putting the neonate in the arms of a person who is cohabiting with the mother.","Odent Michel R","Medical hypotheses","Animals, Antibodies, BCG Vaccine, Cesarean Section, Colostrum, Female, Fetus, Humans, Immunoglobulin G, Infant, Newborn, Parturition, Placenta, Pregnancy, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Risk Factors, Th1 Cells, Th2 Cells, Time Factors, Vaccination","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27142139","Primal Health Research Centre, 72 Savernake Road, London NW3 2JR, UK.

Recently, we reported changes in social competence following peer-mediated, theatre-based intervention. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of the intervention on reducing anxiety and stress. Participants included 30 youth with autism spectrum disorder (8-14 years old) randomly assigned to the experimental (17) or waitlist control (13) group. Pretest adjusted, between-group differences were analyzed for state-anxiety, trait-anxiety, play-based cortisol, and diurnal cortisol. Pearson correlations were conducted between anxiety, cortisol, and group play. Significant pretest-adjusted between-group differences at posttest were observed on trait-anxiety (F(1, 27) = 9.16, p = 0.005) but not state-anxiety (F(1, 27) = 0.03, p = 0.86), showing lower trait-anxiety in the experimental group. There were no between-group differences on cortisol. There was a significant negative correlation between group play and trait-anxiety (r = -0.362, p = 0.05).

Almost two-thirds (n = 108; 64%) of families in the 9-week study participated in week 52 follow-ups (Basic, n = 55; Augmented, n = 53) and were representative of the initial study sample. The assessment battery included caregiver and clinician ratings and laboratory tests. Only 43% of participants in the Augmented group and 36% in the Basic group still adhered to their assigned regimen (not significant [NS]); 23% of those in the Augmented group and 11% in the Basic group were taking no medication (NS). Both randomized groups improved baseline to follow-up, but the 3 primary parent-reported behavioral outcomes showed no significant between-group differences. Exploratory analyses indicated that participants in the Augmented group (65%) were more likely (p = .02) to have a Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) severity score of 1 to 3 (i.e., normal to mildly ill) at follow-up than those in the Basic group (42%). Parents rated 45% of children as impaired often or very often from ADHD, noncompliant, or aggressive behavior. The Augmented group had elevated prolactin levels, and the Basic group had decreased weight over time. Findings were generally similar whether groups were defined by randomized assignment or follow-up treatment status. Both treatment strategies were associated with clinical improvement at follow-up, and primary behavioral outcomes did not differ significantly.

The GI disturbances in ASD might be linked to gut dysbiosis representing the observable phenotype of a ""gut-brain axis"" disruption. The exploitation of strategies which can restore normal gut microbiota and reduce the gut production and absorption of toxins, such as probiotics addition/supplementation in a diet, may represent a non-pharmacological option in the treatment of GI disturbances in ASD. The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to determine the effects of supplementation with a probiotic mixture (Vivomixx®) in ASD children not only on specific GI symptoms, but also on the core deficits of the disorder, on cognitive and language development, and on brain function and connectivity. An ancillary aim is to evaluate possible effects of probiotic supplementation on urinary concentrations of phthalates (chemical pollutants) which have been previously linked to ASD. A group of 100 preschoolers with ASD will be classified as belonging to a GI group or to a Non-GI (NGI) group on the basis of a symptom severity index specific to GI disorders. In order to obtain four arms, subjects belonging to the two groups (GI and NGI) will be blind randomized 1:1 to regular diet with probiotics or with placebo for 6 months. All participants will be assessed at baseline, after three months and after six months from baseline in order to evaluate the possible changes in: (1) GI symptoms; (2) autism symptoms severity; (3) affective and behavioral comorbid symptoms; (4) plasmatic, urinary and fecal biomarkers related to abnormal intestinal function; (5) neurophysiological patterns. The effects of treatments with probiotics on children with ASD need to be evaluated through rigorous controlled trials. Examining the impact of probiotics not only on clinical but also on neurophysiological patterns, the current trial sets out to provide new insights into the gut-brain connection in ASD patients. Moreover, results could add information to the relationship between phthalates levels, clinical features and neurophysiological patterns in ASD. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02708901 .

Individuals in whom the disorders are comorbid show more severe impairment because of deficits in the processing of social situations, adaptive functioning, and executive control than individuals with either disorder alone. This open-label pilot study aimed to evaluate and compare the efficacy and tolerability of risperidone and aripiprazole for treating ADHD symptoms in patients with both ASD and ADHD over the course of 24 weeks of treatment. Patients (n = 44) were randomly assigned to start treatment with risperidone (22 patients) or aripiprazole (22 patients). Children were evaluated before starting treatment (T0), and after 12 weeks (T1) and 24 weeks (T2) of treatment. At each visit, specific psychiatric clinical scales were administered to assess the efficacy of the two drugs. The mean age was 8.4 ± 2.9 years in the aripiprazole group and 7.8 ± 2.3 years in the risperidone group. A total of 37 children (29 boys and 8 girls) completed the study (18 in the aripiprazole group and 19 in the risperidone group).

Therapeutic approaches to date have focused on skills acquisition, support tailored to the characteristics of autism spectrum disorder, and interventions in social cognitive functioning; there have been few reports describing interventions aimed at neurocognitive dysfunction. In this study, we focus on impairment of executive functioning in autism spectrum disorder patients and investigate improvements in executive functioning and their generalization to social functioning. The intervention adopted for this study was cognitive remediation therapy using the frontal/executive program. To investigate the effectiveness of frontal/executive program, 15 subjects who consented to participate in the study were randomly assigned to an intervention group or control group. Frontal/executive program was administered to the intervention group for about six months. Both groups were evaluated using the same scales: BACS-J, WCST, and CPT for cognitive assessment; SCoRS-J, GAF, and LASMI for social functioning; and GSE for self-efficacy. Both groups had lower scores for cognitive functioning than normal individuals at baseline. After completion of frontal/executive program, the intervention group showed improved performance on BACS-J for overall score, digit sequencing, verbal fluency, and Tower of London tasks. Improvements were also seen on SCoRS-J and LASMI scales of social functioning. This was the first study to use frontal/executive program to focus on neurocognitive dysfunction in autism spectrum disorder patients. Frontal/executive program is effective in improving impaired executive functioning in autism spectrum disorder patients and may also lead to improvements in some aspects of social functioning.","Miyajima Maki, Omiya Hidetoshi, Yamashita Kiyoko, Miyata Tomoki, Yambe Kenji, Matsui Mie, Denda Kenzo","International journal of psychiatry in medicine","Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Cognition, Cognitive Remediation, Executive Function, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Neuropsychological Tests, Social Adjustment, Treatment Outcome","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27284115","Department of Functioning and Disability, Faculty of Health Science, Hokkaido University, Hokkaido, Japan kdenda@med.hokudai.ac.jp.; Department of Functioning and Disability, Faculty of Health Science, Hokkaido University, Hokkaido, Japan Asahiyama Hospital, Hokkaido, Japan.; Department of Psychology, School of Medicine, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.; Asahiyama Hospital, Hokkaido, Japan.",

This was a 24-week, 6-site, randomized trial of parent training versus parent education in 180 children with ASD (aged 3-7 years; 158 boys and 22 girls) and moderate or greater behavioral problems. Parent training included specific strategies to manage disruptive behavior over 11 to 13 sessions, 2 telephone boosters, and 2 home visits. Parent education provided useful information about autism but no behavior management strategies over 12 core sessions and 1 home visit. In a previous report, we showed that parent training was superior to parent education in reducing disruptive behavior in young children with ASD. Here, we test whether parent training is superior to parent education in improving daily living skills as measured by the parent-rated Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales II. The long-term impact of parent training on adaptive functioning is also presented. At week 24, the parent training group showed a 5.7-point improvement from baseline on the Daily Living domain compared to no change in parent education (p = .004; effect size = 0.36). On the Socialization domain, there was a 5.9-point improvement in parent training versus a 3.1-point improvement in parent education (p = .11; effect size = 0.29). Gains in the Communication domain were similar across treatment groups. The gain in Daily Living was greater in children with IQ of >70. However, the interaction of treatment-by-IQ was not significant. Gains in Daily Living at week 24 were maintained upon re-evaluation at 24 weeks posttreatment. These results support the model that reduction in disruptive behavior can lead to improvement in activities of daily living. By contrast, the expected trajectory for adaptive behavior in children with ASD is often flat and predictably declines in children with intellectual disability. In the parent training group, higher-functioning children achieved significant gains in daily living skills. Children with intellectual disability kept pace with time.

Fenfluramine significantly increased HVA levels in responders whereas no significant modification was found in nonresponders. Moreover the initial level of HVA (lower in responders) significantly differentiated the two groups.

Two groups of trials were conducted using either Acunil or a placebo (control). Animals (Acunil: n = 17; placebo: n = 12) were observed for a 12-hr period before the administration of Acunil or the placebo (pretreatment). After 24 hr, animals were administered Acunil (1.5 mg/kg) or a placebo (1.0-3.0 ml of sterile water) and observed again for 12 hr (posttreatment). During both treatments, animals were stimulated every 2 hr for 1 min by a person entering the enclosure (referred to as periods of stimulation). Behavioral observations and continuous heart rate, respiration rate, and motion measurements were taken throughout. Animals treated with Acunil spent more time lying with their heads folded back, eating and standing with their heads down, and less time being vigilant and exploring while walking around. Animals treated with the placebo also spent less time being vigilant and more time lying with heads up. Animals treated with Acunil groomed less while standing and performed less head shaking; no such changes were observed in the control group. Neither Acunil nor the placebo had any effect (P > 0.05) on heart rate. However, overall mean respiration rate was lowered (P = 0.02) when animals were treated with Acunil (pretreatment: 14.5 ± 0.82 breaths/min; posttreatment: 12.5 ± 0.83 breaths/min). Acunil also caused a lowered (P < 0.05) respiration rate during periods when animals were stimulated (pretreatment: 16.2 ± 0.87 breaths/min; posttreatment: 13.7 ± 0.87 breaths/min) and when animals were trotting and being vigilant. No such changes were observed with the placebo. Both placebo- and Acunil-treated animals spent more time being stationary during periods of stimulation.

Cognition may be affected across a range of domains, including memory, psychomotor skills, and executive function. Whilst the exact mechanisms of cognitive change after surgery are not precisely known, oxidative stress and subsequent neuroinflammation have been implicated. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) acts via multiple interrelated mechanisms to influence oxidative homeostasis, neuronal transmission, and inflammation. NAC has been shown to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in both human and animal models. There is clinical evidence to suggest that NAC may be beneficial in preventing the cognitive decline associated with both acute physiological insults and dementia-related disorders. To date, no trials have examined perioperative NAC as a potential moderator of postoperative cognitive changes in the noncardiac surgery setting. This is a single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, with a between-group, repeated-measures, longitudinal design. The study will recruit 370 noncardiac surgical patients at the University Hospital Geelong, aged 60 years or older. Participants are randomly assigned to receive either NAC or placebo (1:1 ratio), and groups are stratified by age and surgery type. Participants undergo a series of neuropsychological tests prior to surgery, 7 days, 3 months, and 12 months post surgery. It is hypothesised that the perioperative administration of NAC will reduce the degree of postoperative cognitive changes at early and long-term follow-up, as measured by changes on individual measures of the neurocognitive battery, when compared with placebo. Serum samples are taken on the day of surgery and on day 2 post surgery to quantitate any changes in levels of biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress. The PANACEA trial aims to examine the potential efficacy of perioperative NAC to reduce the severity of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in an elderly, noncardiac surgery population. This is an entirely novel approach to the prevention of postoperative cognitive dysfunction and will have high impact and translatable outcomes if NAC is found to be beneficial.

Oxytocin (OT) and cortisol are key neuromodulators of biological and behavioral responses, show a synergistic effect, and have been implicated in the neuropathological profile in ASD. However, they are rarely investigated together. The purpose of the pilot study was to evaluate the relationship between cortisol and OT in children with ASD under baseline and physiological stress (hydrocortisone challenge) conditions. Arginine vasopressin (AVP), structurally similar to OT, was also examined. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomly assigned, crossover design was employed in 25 children 8-to-12 years with ASD (N = 14) or typical development (TD, N = 11). A low dose of hydrocortisone and placebo were administered via liquid suspension. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine the within-subject factor ""Condition"" (hydrocortisone/placebo) and ""Time"" (pre and post) and the between-subject factor ""Group"" (ASD vs. TD). Pearson correlations examined the relationship between hormone levels and clinical profile. There was a significant Time × Condition × Group interaction F (1.23) = 4.18, p = 0.05 showing a rise in OT during the experimental condition (hydrocortisone) and a drop during the placebo condition for the TD group but not the ASD group. There were no group differences for AVP. Hormone levels were associated with social profiles. For the TD group, an inverse relationship was observed. OT increased during physiological challenge suggesting that OT played a stress-buffering role during cortisol administration. In contrast for the ASD group, OT remained unchanged or decreased during both the physiological challenge and the placebo condition, suggesting that OT failed to serve as a stress buffer under conditions of physiological stress. While OT has been tied to the social ability of children with ASD, the diminished moderating effect of OT on cortisol may also play a contributory role in the heightened stress often observed in children with ASD. These results contribute to our understanding of the growing complexity of the effects of OT on social behavior as well as the functional interplay and differential regulation OT may have on stress modulation.","Corbett Blythe A, Bales Karen L, Swain Deanna, Sanders Kevin, Weinstein Tamara A R, Muglia Louis J","Journal of neurodevelopmental disorders",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27540420","Department of Pediatrics, Perinatal Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH USA.; University of California, Davis, CA USA.; Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA USA.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Vanderbilt University, PMB 40, 230 Appleton Place, Nashville, TN 37203 USA ; Vanderbilt Kennedy Center for Research on Human Development, Nashville, TN USA ; Department of Psychology, Vanderbilt University, Nasvhille, TN USA.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Vanderbilt University, PMB 40, 230 Appleton Place, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.",

We conducted a single-center phase 2, pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, clinical trial in young adults with high-functioning ASD, to determine whether oxytocin dosage and genetic background of the oxytocin receptor affects oxytocin efficacy. This trial consisted of double-blind (12 weeks), open-label (12 weeks) and follow-up phases (8 weeks). To examine dose dependency, 60 participants were randomly assigned to high-dose (32 IU per day) or low-dose intranasal oxytocin (16 IU per day), or placebo groups during the double-blind phase. Next, we measured single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR). In the intention-to-treat population, no outcomes were improved after oxytocin administration. However, in male participants, Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scores in the high-dose group, but not the low-dose group, were significantly higher than in the placebo group. Furthermore, we examined whether oxytocin efficacy, reflected in the CGI-I scores, is influenced by estimated daily dosage and OXTR polymorphisms in male participants. We found that >21 IU per day oxytocin was more effective than ⩽21 IU per day, and that a SNP in OXTR (rs6791619) predicted CGI-I scores for ⩽21 IU per day oxytocin treatment. No severe adverse events occurred. These results suggest that efficacy of long-term oxytocin administration in young men with high-functioning ASD depends on the oxytocin dosage and genetic background of the oxytocin receptor, which contributes to the effectiveness of oxytocin treatment of ASD.","Kosaka H, Okamoto Y, Munesue T, Yamasue H, Inohara K, Fujioka T, Anme T, Orisaka M, Ishitobi M, Jung M, Fujisawa T X, Tanaka S, Arai S, Asano M, Saito D N, Sadato N, Tomoda A, Omori M, Sato M, Okazawa H, Higashida H, Wada Y","Translational psychiatry","Administration, Intranasal, Adolescent, Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Double-Blind Method, Female, Genotype, Humans, Male, Oxytocics, Oxytocin, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Receptors, Oxytocin, Sex Factors, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27552585","Department of Neuropsychiatry, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, Eiheiji, Japan.; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Fukui, Eiheiji, Japan.; Department of Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; Research Center for Child Mental Development, University of Fukui, Eiheiji, Japan.; Research Center for Child Mental Development, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.; Faculty of Nursing and Social Welfare Sciences, Fukui Prefectural University, Eiheiji, Japan.; Department of Cerebral Research, National Institute for Physiological Sciences, Okazaki, Japan.; International Community Care and Lifespan Development, Empowerment Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.",

Unfortunately, these medications are associated with weight gain and metabolic complications that are especially troubling in children and with long-term use. To evaluate the efficacy of metformin for weight gain associated with atypical antipsychotic medications in children and adolescents with ASD (defined in the protocol as DSM-IV diagnosis of autistic disorder, Asperger disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified), aged 6 to 17 years. A 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial was conducted at 4 centers in Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Columbus, Ohio; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Nashville, Tennessee. In all, 209 potential participants were screened by telephone, 69 individuals provided consent, and 61 participants were randomized to receive metformin or placebo between April 26, 2013, and June 24, 2015. Metformin or matching placebo titrated up to 500 mg twice daily for children aged 6 to 9 years and 850 mg twice daily for those 10 to 17 years. The primary outcome measure was change in body mass index (BMI) z score during 16 weeks of treatment. Secondary outcomes included changes in additional body composition and metabolic variables. Safety, tolerability, and efficacy analyses all used a modified intent-to-treat sample comprising all participants who received at least 1 dose of medication. Of the 61 randomized participants, 60 participants initiated treatment (45 [75%] male; mean [SD] age, 12.8 [2.7] years). Metformin reduced BMI z scores from baseline to week 16 significantly more than placebo (difference in 16-week change scores vs placebo, -0.10 [95% CI, -0.16 to -0.04]; P = .003). Statistically significant improvements were also noted in secondary body composition measures (raw BMI, -0.95 [95% CI, -1.46 to -0.45] and raw weight, -2.73 [95% CI, -4.04 to -1.43]) but not in metabolic variables. Overall, metformin was well tolerated. Five participants in the metformin group discontinued treatment owing to adverse events (agitation, 4; sedation, 1). Participants receiving metformin vs placebo experienced gastrointestinal adverse events during a significantly higher percentage of treatment days (25.1% vs 6.8%; P = .005).

Eighty-one subjects were screened for eligibility, and 57 were randomized to sertraline (27) or placebo (30). Two subjects from the sertraline arm and 3 from the placebo arm discontinued. Intent-to-treat analysis showed no difference from placebo on the primary outcomes: the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) expressive language (EL) age equivalent and Clinical Global Impression Scale-Improvement. However, analyses of secondary measures showed significant improvements, particularly in motor and visual perceptual abilities and social participation.

Furthermore, post hoc analysis found significant improvement in early EL development as measured by the MSEL among children with autism spectrum disorder on sertraline. Treatment appears safe for this 6-month period in young children with FXS, but the authors do not know the long-term side effects of this treatment.

However, anything from 40-60 % of people on clozapine experience residual symptoms even on adequate doses of the medication, and thus could be considered 'clozapine resistant'. Agents that could work alongside clozapine to improve efficacy whilst not increasing the adverse effect burden are both desired and necessary to improve the lives of individuals with clozapine-resistant SZ. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is one such possible agent. Previous research from our research group provided promising pilot data suggesting the efficacy of NAC in this patient population. The aim of the study reported here is to expand this work by conducting a large scale clinical trial of NAC in the treatment of clozapine-resistant SZ. This study is an investigator initiated, multi-site, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. It aims to include 168 patients with clozapine-resistant SZ, divided into an intervention group (NAC) and a control group (placebo). Participants in the intervention group will receive 2 g daily of NAC. The primary outcome measures will be the negative symptom scores of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Secondary outcome measures will include: changes in quality of life (QoL) as measured by the Lancashire Quality of Life Profile (LQoLP) and cognitive functioning as measured by the total score on the MATRICS. Additionally we will examine peripheral and cortical glutathione (GSH) concentrations as process outcomes. This large scale clinical trial will investigate the efficacy of NAC as an adjunctive medication to clozapine.

These features are common and can have an often-devastating impact on autistic individuals and their families. Yet there are few validated interventions that help to remediate or support autistic individuals' adverse sensory experiences. To date, both measurement of sensory experiences and the resulting interventions have been based on assumptions of neurological sensitivities and largely ignored the role of cognition. This study therefore sought to assess the feasibility of a new 8-week CBT-based group intervention for self-regulation of sensory processing difficulties. Seven cognitively able adolescents diagnosed with autism aged 11-16 years from one mainstream secondary school received the 8-week intervention. Measures of sensory reactivity, anxiety and repetitive behaviours were taken at baseline, post-intervention and follow-up, 8 weeks after the intervention had ceased. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were also conducted with adolescents and their parents to examine further the acceptability of the intervention. The results showed that the intervention itself was feasible - both in its implementation and its acceptability to participants. Qualitative analysis clearly showed that the intervention was effective in raising meta-conscious awareness and self-regulation in these autistic adolescents. Analysis of outcome variables showed no significant change over the intervention period, although effect sizes were moderate-to-large. These preliminary results are encouraging and should inform the design of a future pilot randomized controlled trial to test its efficacy with a larger group of participants.","Edgington Louise, Hill Vivian, Pellicano Elizabeth","Research in developmental disabilities","Adolescent, Anxiety, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Feasibility Studies, Focus Groups, Humans, Male, Metacognition, Patient Acceptance of Health Care, Psychotherapy, Group, Qualitative Research, Self-Control, Sensation, Treatment Outcome","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27639063","Centre for Research in Autism and Education (CRAE), UCL Institute of Education, University College London, UK; School of Psychology, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.

In the present report, they describe a 24-week extension of treatment responders and nonresponders. One-hundred seventeen participants from the acute trial (91%) entered the extension; 84 of these were in 2 subgroups: ""treatment responders"" (n = 43) from all 4 groups in the acute trial, seen monthly for 24 weeks, and ""placebo nonresponders"" (n = 41), treated with open-label ATX for 10 weeks. Participants originally assigned to PT continued PT during the extension; the remainder served as controls. Primary outcome measurements were the parent-rated Swanson, Nolan and Pelham ADHD scale and the Home Situations Questionnaire. Sixty percent (26 of 43) of treatment responders in the acute trial, including 68% of responders originally assigned to ATX, still met the response criteria at the end of the extension. The response rate of placebo nonresponders treated with 10-week open-label ATX was 37% (15 of 41), similar to the acute trial. Children receiving open-label ATX + PT were significantly more likely to be ADHD responders (53% versus 23%) and noncompliance responders (58% versus 14%) than those receiving open-label ATX alone.

Noncardioselective β-blockers not only reduce portal hypertension and prevent variceal bleeding in cirrhosis but also impair glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in other settings. This study aimed to determine whether nonselective β-blockade with nadolol impairs glucose metabolism in liver cirrhosis. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of nadolol in cirrhotic patients examined insulin sensitivity, disposition index, and glucose tolerance. Stable cirrhotic patients of mixed etiology underwent an intravenous glucose tolerance test and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp for the measurement of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity (n = 16) and a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (n = 17). These measurements were conducted twice (after 3 months of treatment with nadolol or placebo and, after a 1-month washout period, after 3 months on the alternative treatment). Total body fat and plasma catecholamines were measured at the end of each 3-month treatment.

No effective pharmacotherapy for these core deficits exists. Within the domain of social communication, the vasopressin system is implicated in social cognition and social signaling deficits of ASD, and represents a potential therapeutic target. We assessed the effects of a single 20 mg intravenous dose of the arginine vasopressin receptor 1A (V1a) antagonist, RG7713, on exploratory biomarkers (eye tracking), behavioral and clinical measures of social cognition and communication (affective speech recognition (ASR), reading the mind in the eyes, olfactory identification, scripted interaction), and safety and tolerability in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of 19 high-functioning adult male subjects with DSM-IV Autistic Disorder (age 18-45 years; full scale IQ >70; ABC-Irritability subscale ⩽13). Eye-tracking showed an increase in biological motion orienting preference with RG7713 (ES=0.8, p=0.047) and a non-significant improvement in the composite score (ES=0.2, p=0.29). RG7713 reduced ability to detect lust (ES=-0.8, p=0.03) and fear (ES=-0.7, p=0.07) in ASR. However, when all eight individual emotion subscales were combined into an overall ASR performance score, the reduction was non-significant (ES=-0.1, p=0.59). Thirteen adverse events were reported in 10 subjects; all were of mild (11/13) or moderate (2/13) severity.

This study examined the effects of risperidone on cardiac conduction in children with ASD. Data were collected from an 8-week, five-site trial conducted by the Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology Autism Network. Children (age 5-17 years) were randomly assigned to risperidone (n = 49) or placebo (n = 52) under double-blind conditions. Risperidone was superior to placebo in reducing serious behavioral problems. A standard 12-lead, electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained in most subjects at screening and week 8. A pediatric electrophysiologist blind to treatment assignment reviewed all available ECGs for readability, abnormalities, and cardiac conduction parameters, including QTc. The electrophysiologist measurements were compared to machine readings. A second blinded electrophysiologist examined all available ECGs for abnormalities and a 20% random sample for QTc. Of the 101 randomized subjects in the trial, complete pretreatment and week 8 data were available on 65 subjects (placebo n = 30; risperidone n = 35). The electrophysiologist did not identify any cardiac conduction adverse effects of risperidone and there was no difference in mean change on the QTc compared to placebo. The Bland-Altman plot showed a systematic bias in QTc measurements by the electrophysiologist and machine. Machine readings produced higher values than the electrophysiologist for shorter QTc intervals and machine scoring was lower than electrophysiologist readings for longer QTc values (p = 0.001). Two electrophysiologists had overall percent agreements of 82.9% (95% CI: 76.3 to 89.6) on qualitative assessment and 88.6% (95% CI: 79.3 to 98.0) on QTc interval. Using conventional doses during acute treatment in children with ASD and serious behavioral problems, there was no difference in the mean change in QTc between risperidone and placebo.

Presently, no therapies are available to effectively treat individuals with all of the symptoms of this disorder. It has been suggested that hyperbaric oxygen therapy may alleviate the biochemical dysfunction and clinical symptoms of ASD. To determine whether treatment with hyperbaric oxygen:1. improves core symptoms of ASD, including social communication problems and stereotypical and repetitive behaviors;2. improves noncore symptoms of ASD, such as challenging behaviors;3. improves comorbid states, such as depression and anxiety; and4. causes adverse effects. On 10 December 2015, we searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and 15 other databases, four of which were Chinese language databases. We also searched multiple trial and research registers. We selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of any dose, duration, and frequency for hyperbaric oxygen therapy compared with no treatment or sham treatment for children and adults with ASD. We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration, in that three review authors independently selected studies, assessed them for risk of bias, and extracted relevant data. We also assessed the quality of the evidence by using the GRADE approach. We included one trial with a total of 60 children with a diagnosis of ASD who randomly received hyperbaric oxygen therapy or a sham treatment. Using GRADE criteria, we rated the quality of the evidence as low because of the small sample size and wide confidence intervals (CIs). Other problems included selection bias and short duration or follow-up.Overall, study authors reported no improvement in social interaction and communication, behavioral problems, communication and linguistic abilities, or cognitive function. With regard to the safety of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (adverse events), they reported minor-grade ear barotrauma events. Investigators found significant differences between groups in total number of side effect events (Peto odds ratio (OR) 3.87, 95% CI 1.53 to 9.82) and in the number of children who experienced side effects (Peto OR 4.40, 95% CI 1.33 to 14.48). To date, there is no evidence that hyperbaric oxygen therapy improves core symptoms and associated symptoms of ASD. It is important to note that adverse effects (minor-grade ear barotrauma events) can occur. Given the absence of evidence of effectiveness and the limited biological plausibility and possible adverse effects, the need for future RCTs of hyperbaric oxygen therapy must be carefully considered.","Xiong Tao, Chen Hongju, Luo Rong, Mu Dezhi","The Cochrane database of systematic reviews","Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Cognition, Communication, Humans, Hyperbaric Oxygenation, Interpersonal Relations, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27737490","Department of Pediatrics, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, No. 17, Section Three, Ren Min Nan Lu Avenue, Chengdu, Sichuan, China, 610041.",

However, neither biological functions of OXTR SNPs in ASD nor critical OXTR SNPs that determine oxytocin's effects on ASD remains known. Here, using a machine-learning algorithm that was designed to evaluate collective effects of multiple SNPs and automatically identify most informative SNPs, we examined relationships between 27 representative OXTR SNPs and six types of behavioral/neural response to oxytocin in ASD individuals. The oxytocin effects were extracted from our previous placebo-controlled within-participant clinical trial administering single-dose intranasal oxytocin to 38 high-functioning adult Japanese ASD males. Consequently, we identified six different SNP sets that could accurately predict the six different oxytocin efficacies, and confirmed the robustness of these SNP selections against variations of the datasets and analysis parameters. Moreover, major alleles of several prominent OXTR SNPs-including rs53576 and rs2254298-were found to have dissociable effects on the oxytocin efficacies. These findings suggest biological functions of the OXTR SNP variants on autistic oxytocin responses, and implied that clinical oxytocin efficacy may be genetically predicted before its actual administration, which would contribute to establishment of future precision medicines for ASD.","Watanabe Takamitsu, Otowa Takeshi, Abe Osamu, Kuwabara Hitoshi, Aoki Yuta, Natsubori Tatsunobu, Takao Hidemasa, Kakiuchi Chihiro, Kondo Kenji, Ikeda Masashi, Iwata Nakao, Kasai Kiyoto, Sasaki Tsukasa, Yamasue Hidenori","Social cognitive and affective neuroscience","Adolescent, Adult, Algorithms, Alleles, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Genetic Variation, Genotype, Humans, Machine Learning, Male, Oxytocin, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Receptors, Oxytocin, Social Behavior, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27798253","Department of Radiology Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.; Department of Physical and Health Education Graduate School of Education, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.; Department of Neuropsychiatry Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.; Disability Services Office.; Department of Radiology, Nihon University School of Medicine, 30-1 Oyaguchikami-cho, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo 173-8610, Japan.; Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, 17 Queen Square, London WC1N 3AZ, UK.; Department of Psychiatry Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Aichi 470-1192, Japan.",

Evidence suggests that some individuals with ASD have cognitive impairments related to weak central coherence and hyperrestricted processing. Reducing noradrenergic activity may improve aspects of network processing and thus improve cognitive abilities, such as verbal problem solving, in individuals with ASD. The present pilot study explores the effects of acute administration of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol on verbal problem solving in adults and adolescents with ASD. In a within-subject crossover-design, 20 participants with ASD received a single dose of propranolol or placebo on one of two sessions in a double-blinded, counterbalanced manner. Verbal problem solving was assessed via an anagram task. Baseline measurements of autonomic nervous system functioning were obtained, and anxiety was assessed at baseline and following drug administration. Participants solved the anagrams more quickly in the propranolol condition, as compared to the placebo condition, suggesting a potential cognitive benefit of this agent. Additionally, we observed a negative linear relationship between response to propranolol on the anagram task and two measures of baseline autonomic activity, as well as a positive linear relationship between drug response and baseline anxiety. These relationships propose potential markers for treatment response, as propranolol influences both autonomic functioning and anxiety.

The social deficits that characterize ASD may relate to reduced connectivity between brain sites on the mesolimbic reward pathway (nucleus accumbens; amygdala) that receive OT projections and contribute to social motivation, and cortical sites involved in social perception. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, we show that OT administration in ASD increases activity in brain regions important for perceiving social-emotional information. Further, OT enhances connectivity between nodes of the brain's reward and socioemotional processing systems, and does so preferentially for social (versus nonsocial) stimuli. This effect is observed both while viewing coherent versus scrambled biological motion, and while listening to happy versus angry voices. Our findings suggest a mechanism by which intranasal OT may bolster social motivation-one that could, in future, be harnessed to augment behavioral treatments for ASD.","Gordon Ilanit, Jack Allison, Pretzsch Charlotte M, Vander Wyk Brent, Leckman James F, Feldman Ruth, Pelphrey Kevin A","Scientific reports","Administration, Intranasal, Adolescent, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Brain, Brain Mapping, Child, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Motivation, Oxytocin, Social Perception","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27845765","Child Study Center, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.; Autism and Neurodevelopmental Disorders Institute, George Washington University, Ashburn, VA 20147, USA.",

It has been previously reported that there is vitamin D deficiency in autistic children; however, there is a lack of randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation in ASD children. This study is a double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (RCT) that was conducted on 109 children with ASD (85 boys and 24 girls; aged 3-10 years). The aim of this study was to assess the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the core symptoms of autism in children. ASD patients were randomized to receive vitamin D3 or placebo for 4 months. The serum levels of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25 (OH)D) were measured at the beginning and at the end of the study. The autism severity and social maturity of the children were assessed by the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), and the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC). UMIN-CTR Study Design: trial number: UMIN000020281. Supplementation of vitamin D was well tolerated by the ASD children. The daily doses used in the therapy group was 300 IU vitamin D3/kg/day, not to exceed 5,000 IU/day. The autism symptoms of the children improved significantly, following 4-month vitamin D3 supplementation, but not in the placebo group. This study demonstrates the efficacy and tolerability of high doses of vitamin D3 in children with ASD. This study is the first double-blinded RCT proving the efficacy of vitamin D3 in ASD patients. Depending on the parameters measured in the study, oral vitamin D supplementation may safely improve signs and symptoms of ASD and could be recommended for children with ASD. At this stage, this study is a single RCT with a small number of patients, and a great deal of additional wide-scale studies are needed to critically validate the efficacy of vitamin D in ASD.","Saad Khaled, Abdel-Rahman Ahmed A, Elserogy Yasser M, Al-Atram Abdulrahman A, El-Houfey Amira A, Othman Hisham A-K, Bjørklund Geir, Jia Feiyong, Urbina Mauricio A, Abo-Elela Mohamed Gamil M, Ahmad Faisal-Alkhateeb, Abd El-Baseer Khaled A, Ahmed Ahmed E, Abdel-Salam Ahmad M","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Dietary Supplements, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Vitamin D","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27868194","Department of Clinical Pathology, Aswan University, Aswan, Egypt.; Department of Community Health Nursing, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.; Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.; Department of Psychiatry, College of Medicine, Almajmaah University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.; Council for Nutritional and Environmental Medicine, Mo i Rana, Norway.; Department of Pediatrics, Qena Faculty of Medicine, South Valley University, Qena, Egypt.; Department of Pediatric Neurology and Neurorehabilitation, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.; Department of Neuropsychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.; Department of Biosciences, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK.; Department of Pharmaceutics and Industrial Pharmacy, Alazhar University, Assiut, Egypt.",

Manipulation of the gut microbiome with probiotics may be a therapeutic strategy with the potential to relieve gastrointestinal (GI) comorbidities and improve psychiatric symptoms. Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, commensal yeast species, can be imbalanced in the unhealthy human microbiome, and these fungal exposures were previously found elevated in schizophrenia. In a longitudinal, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot investigation of 56 outpatients with schizophrenia, we examined the impact of probiotic treatment on yeast antibody levels, and the relationship between treatment and antibody levels on bowel discomfort and psychiatric symptoms. We found that probiotic treatment significantly reduced C. albicans antibodies over the 14-week study period in males, but not in females. Antibody levels of S. cerevisiae were not altered in either treatment group. The highest levels of bowel discomfort over time occurred in C. albicans-seropositive males receiving the placebo. We observed trends towards improvement in positive psychiatric symptoms in males treated with probiotics who were seronegative for C. albicans. Results from this pilot study hint at an association of C. albicans seropositivity with worse positive psychiatric symptoms, which was confirmed in a larger cohort of 384 males with schizophrenia.

Despite advantages, these measures may not capture parental impression of the child's most salient problems. We examine the use of parent target problems (PTPs) in a randomized trial of methylphenidate (MPH) in children with autism spectrum disorder and symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. This multisite, 4-week, randomized crossover trial compared three dose levels (low, medium, and high) of MPH with placebo. At baseline, the independent evaluator (IE) asked parents to nominate the child's two biggest problems. For each problem, the IE and parent coconstructed a brief narrative of the behavior and the impact on family life. The IE and parents reviewed and revised the narratives at subsequent visits. A panel of four judges, blind to treatment condition, independently reviewed the narratives to rate change from baseline on a 9-point scale: 1, normal; 2, markedly improved; 3, definitely improved; 4, equivocally improved; 5, no change; 6, possibly worse; 7, definitely worse; 8, markedly worse; 9, disastrously worse.

It aims to combine new pathophysiologically based treatments with objective tests (stratification biomarkers) to predict which treatment may be beneficial for a particular person. Here we discuss significant advances and current challenges for this approach: rare monogenic forms of ASD have provided a major breakthrough for the identification of treatment targets by providing a means to trace causal links from a gene to specific molecular alterations and biological pathways. To estimate whether treatment targets thus identified may be useful for larger patient groups we need a better understanding of whether different etiologies (i.e., genetic and environmental risk factors acting at different critical time points) lead to convergent or divergent molecular mechanisms, and how they map onto differences in circuit-level brain and cognitive development, and behavioral symptom profiles. Several recently failed clinical trials with syndromic forms of ASD provide valuable insights into conceptual and methodological issues linked to limitations in the translatability from animal models to humans, placebo effects, and a need for mechanistically plausible, objective outcome measures. To identify stratification biomarkers that enrich participant selection in clinical trials, large-scale multi-modal longitudinal observational studies are underway. Addressing these different factors in the next generation of research studies requires a translatable developmental perspective and multidisciplinary, collaborative efforts, with a commitment to sharing protocols and data, to increase transparency and reproducibility.","Loth Eva, Murphy Declan G, Spooren Will","Frontiers in psychiatry",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27965598","Roche Pharmaceutical Research and Early Development, NORD Discovery and Translational Area, Roche Innovation Center , Basel , Switzerland.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK; Sackler Institute for Translational Neurodevelopment, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.",

Participants were children diagnosed with ASD. All functional outcome measures reported were considered. For dichotomous outcomes, the results for individual studies and pooled statistics were reported as RRs. Mean differences (MDs) were calculated for continuous outcomes.<b>Results:</b> Five RCTs (183 participants) were included. With 4 exceptions, there were no statistically significant differences in ASD symptoms between groups measured by validated scales. Among studies that used the Aberrant Behavior Checklist, parents' ratings indicated significant improvement in lethargy symptoms in the ω-3 FA group compared with the placebo group (2 RCTs) (pooled MD: 1.98; 95% CI: 0.32, 3.63). Among studies that used the Behavioral Assessment System for Children, parents' ratings indicated significant worsening of both externalizing behavior (2 RCTs) (pooled MD: -6.22; 95% CI: -10.9, -1.59) and social skills (1 RCT) (MD: -7; 95% CI: -13.62, -0.38) in the ω-3 FA group compared with the placebo group. One RCT reported a significant improvement in the ω-3 FA group for the daily-living component of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (MD: 6.2; 95% CI: 0.37, 12.03). Adverse effects were similar in both groups.<b>Conclusions:</b> Because of the limited number of included studies and small sample sizes, no firm conclusions can be drawn. However, the limited data currently available suggest that ω-3 FA supplementation does not enhance the performance of children with ASD.","Horvath Andrea, Łukasik Jan, Szajewska Hania","The Journal of nutrition","Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Dietary Supplements, Fatty Acids, Omega-3, Humans","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28077731","Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.; Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland hania@ipgate.pl.",

Treatment options to ameliorate symptoms of ASDs are limited. Heterogeneity complicates the quest for personalized medicine in this population. Our aim was to investigate if there are baseline characteristics of patients that moderate response or trial design features that impede the identification of efficacious interventions for ASDs. Literature searches of EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO identified 43 studies for qualitative assessment of baseline characterization of participants and 37 studies for quantitative analysis of moderators of treatment response. Criteria included blinded randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in paediatric ASD, with at least 10 participants per arm or 20 overall, of oral treatments, including pharmacological interventions and dietary supplements. Random-effects meta-analysis of 1997 participants (81% male) identified three moderators associated with an increase in treatment response: trials located in Europe and the Middle-East; outcome measures designated primary status; and the type of outcome measure. Inconsistent reporting of baseline symptom severity and intellectual functioning prevented analysis of these variables. Qualitative synthesis of baseline characteristics identified at least 31 variables, with only age and gender reported in all trials. Biological markers were included in six RCTs. Few trials reported adequate baseline characteristics to permit detailed analysis of response to treatment. Consideration of geographical location, baseline severity and intellectual function is required to ensure generalizability of results. The use of biological markers and correlates in ASD trials remains in its infancy. There is great need to improve the application of baseline characterization and incorporation of biological markers and correlates to permit selection of participants into homogeneous subgroups and to inform response to treatment in ASD.","Masi A, Lampit A, DeMayo M M, Glozier N, Hickie I B, Guastella A J","Psychological medicine","Child, Humans, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Outcome Assessment, Health Care, Research Design, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28091344","Autism Clinic for Translational Research,Brain and Mind Centre,Central Clinical School,Sydney Medical School,University of Sydney,Camperdown,NSW,Australia.; Regenerative Neuroscience Group,Brain and Mind Centre,University of Sydney,Camperdown,NSW,Australia.",

We assessed whether guiding therapy with hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) monitoring may improve survival by preventing VRB. Patients with cirrhosis with controlled variceal bleeding were randomized to an HVPG-guided therapy group (N = 84) or to a control group (N = 86). In both groups, HVPG and acute β-blocker response were evaluated at baseline and HVPG measurements were repeated at 2-4 weeks to determine chronic response. In the HVPG-guided group, acute responders were treated with nadolol and acute nonresponders with nadolol+nitrates. Chronic nonresponders received nadolol+prazosin and had a third HVPG study. Ligation sessions were repeated until response was achieved. The control group was treated with nadolol+nitrates+ligation. Between-group baseline characteristics were similar. During long-term follow-up (median of 24 months), mortality was lower in the HVPG-guided therapy group than in the control group (29% vs. 43%; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.35-0.99). Rebleeding occurred in 19% versus 31% of patients, respectively (HR = 0.53; 95% CI = 0.29-0.98), and further decompensation of cirrhosis occurred in 52% versus 72% (HR = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.46-0.99). The survival probability was higher with HVPG-guided therapy than in controls, both in acute (HR = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.32-1.08) and chronic nonresponders (HR = 0.48; 95% CI = 0.23-0.99). HVPG-guided patients had a greater reduction of HVPG and a lower final value than controls (P < 0.05). HVPG monitoring, by stratifying risk and targeting therapy, improves the survival achieved with currently recommended treatment to prevent VRB using β-blockers and ligation. HVPG-guided therapy achieved a greater reduction in PP, which may have contributed to reduce the risk of rebleeding and of further decompensation of cirrhosis, thus contributing to a better survival.

In conventional techniques, a therapist adjusts the intervention paradigm by monitoring the affective state e.g., anxiety of these individuals for effective floor-time-therapy. Conventional techniques, though powerful, are observation-based and face resource limitations. Technology-assisted systems can provide a quantitative, individualized rehabilitation platform. Presently-available systems are designed primarily to chain learning via aspects of one's performance alone restricting individualization. Specifically, these systems are not sensitive to one's anxiety. Our presented work seeks to bridge this gap by developing a novel VR-based interactive system with Anxiety-Sensitive adaptive technology. Specifically, such a system is capable of objectively identifying and quantifying one's anxiety level from real-time biomarkers, along with performance metrics. In turn it can adaptively respond in an individualized manner to foster improved social communication skills. In our present research, we have used Virtual Reality (VR) to design a proof-of-concept application that exposes participants to social tasks of varying challenges. Results of a preliminary usability study indicate the potential of our VR-based Anxiety-Sensitive system to foster improved task performance, thereby serving as a potent complementary tool in the hands of therapist.","Kuriakose Selvia, Lahiri Uttama","IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","Adolescent, Anxiety, Autistic Disorder, Biofeedback, Psychology, Child, Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted, Equipment Design, Equipment Failure Analysis, Female, Humans, Interpersonal Relations, Male, Reproducibility of Results, Sensitivity and Specificity, Social Communication Disorder, Therapy, Computer-Assisted, Treatment Outcome, User-Computer Interface","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28114071",,

Previous meta-analysis of the literature on well-designed trials of GSSIs is limited in size and scope, collapsing across highly heterogeneous sources (parents; youths; teachers; observers; behavioral tasks). The current meta-analysis of randomized control trials (RCTs) was conducted to ascertain overall effectiveness of GSSIs and differences by reporting sources. Nineteen RCTs met inclusion criteria. Results show that overall positive aggregate effects were medium (g=0.51, p<0.001).

In 40 healthy young adult men state and trait attachment were assessed before and after two weeks of daily intranasal OT (24 IU) or placebo using the State Adult Attachment Scale and the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment. Mood, social responsiveness and quality of life were additionally assessed as secondary outcome measures. Reductions in attachment avoidance and increases in reports of attachment toward peers were reported after two weeks of OT treatment. Further, treatment-induced changes were most pronounced for participants with less secure attachment towards their peers. indicating that normal variance at baseline modulated treatment response. OT treatment was additionally associated with changes in mood, indicating decreases in feelings of tension and (tentatively) anger in the OT group, not in the placebo group. Further, at the end of the two-week trial, both treatment groups (OT, placebo) reported to experience an increase in social responsiveness and quality of life, but the effects were only specific to the OT-treatment in terms of reports on 'social motivation'.

Here, we assess the impact of DCS 11 weeks following active treatment to evaluate the impact of DCS on treatment response durability. Study participants included 60 outpatient youth with ASD, ages 5-11 years, all with IQ above 70, and significantly impaired social functioning who completed a 10-week active treatment phase during which they received weekly single doses of 50 mg of DCS or placebo administered 30 min prior to group social skills training. Following the 10-week active treatment phase, blinded follow-up assessments occurred at week 11 and week 22. The primary outcome measure for our durability of treatment evaluation was the parent-rated social responsiveness scale (SRS) total raw score at week 22. Analysis of the SRS total raw score demonstrated significant decrease for the DCS group compared to the placebo group (<i>p</i> = 0.042) indicating greater maintenance of treatment effect in the DCS group. DCS was well tolerated, with irritability being the most frequently reported adverse effect in both groups. The findings of this study suggest that DCS may help youth with ASD to maintain skills gained during sort-term social skills training.

Vitamin D is metabolized into a seco-steroid hormone that regulates about 3% of the 26,000 genes in the coding human genome. It is also a neurosteroid that is active in brain development, having effects on cellular proliferation, differentiation, calcium signaling, neurotrophic and neuroprotective actions; it also appears to have an effect on neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. Children who are, or who are destined to become, autistic have lower 25(OH)D levels at 3 months of gestation, at birth and at age 8 compared to their unaffected siblings. Two open label trials found high dose vitamin D improves the core symptoms of autism in about 75% of autistic children. A few of the improvements were remarkable. The vitamin D doses used in these children were 300 IU/KG/day up to a maximum of 5000 IU/day (highest final 25(OH)D level reached was 45 ng/ml). The other study used 150,000 IU/month IM as well as 400 IU/day [highest final 25(OH)D level was 52 ng/ml]. These two open label trials were recently confirmed with a randomized controlled trial (RCT) using 300 IU/kg/day with a maximum of 5000 IU/day and resulted in effects similar to the two open label studies. In terms of prevention, a recent small study showed vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy (5000 IU/day) and during infancy and early childhood (1000 IU/day) significantly reduced the expected incidence of autism in mothers who already had one autistic child from 20% to 5%. Vitamin D is safe; for example, over the last 15 years, Poison Control reports there have been approximately 15,000 cases of vitamin D overdose. However only three of these 15,000 people developed clinical toxicity and no one died. Given those facts, practitioners might consider treating autism with 300 IU/kg/day, and seek to prevent autism by supplementing pregnant and lactating women (5000 IU/day) and infants and young children (150 IU/kg/day) checking 25(OH)D levels every 3 months. These doses will increase 25(OH)D blood levels to those recommended by the Endocrine Society. As the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends vitamin D supplementation during infancy and childhood, pediatricians and family practitioners should evaluate the current evidence on autism and vitamin D and act accordingly.","Cannell John Jacob","Reviews in endocrine & metabolic disorders","Adult, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Dietary Supplements, Female, Humans, Infant, Infant, Newborn, Pregnancy, Pregnancy Complications, Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects, Vitamin D, Vitamin D Deficiency","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28217829","Vitamin D Council Inc., 1411 Marsh Street, Suite 203, San Luis Obispo, CA, 93401, USA. jjcannell@vitamindcouncil.org.",

Serotonin plays a vital role in synaptogenesis and postnatal brain development. Deficits in serotonin synthesis and abnormal neurogenesis were shown in young children with autism, suggesting that treating within the first years of life with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor might be the most effective time. In this study we aimed to identify molecular biomarkers involved in the serotonergic pathway that could predict the response to sertraline treatment in young children with FXS. Genotypes were determined for several genes involved in serotonergic pathway in 51 children with FXS, ages 24-72months. Correlations between genotypes and deviations from baseline in primary and secondary outcome measures were modeled using linear regression models. A significant association was observed between a BDNF polymorphism and improvements for several clinical measures, including the Clinical Global Impression scale (P=0.008) and the cognitive T score (P=0.017) in those treated with sertraline compared to those in the placebo group.

Such guidance is provided in the Tackling Teenage Training (TTT) program, in which adolescents with ASD receive psycho-education and practice communicative skills regarding topics related to puberty, sexuality, and intimate relationships. This randomized controlled trial investigated the effects of the TTT program on (a) cognitive outcomes (i.e. psychosexual knowledge, and insight in interpersonal boundaries) and (b) behavioral outcomes (i.e. skills needed for romantic relationships and problematic sexual behavior). A total of 189 cognitively able adolescents with ASD, aged 12-18 years old, were randomized to an intervention condition (n = 95) or a waiting-list control condition (n = 94). We assessed outcomes using self-reported as well as parent-reported questionnaires at baseline (T1), posttreatment (T2; after 6 months), and follow-up (T3; after 12 months). Linear mixed model analyses showed significant treatment effects for psychosexual knowledge and adequate insight in boundaries, both posttreatment and at follow-up. All adolescents increased significantly over time in their social responsiveness and decreased their problematic sexual behavior, irrespectively of condition. The TTT program was most effective for younger adolescents with ASD; following the TTT program resulted in higher psychosexual knowledge, and higher social functioning for these adolescents. The results of this study indicate that the TTT program is effective as a psycho-educational program to provide adolescents with ASD with the knowledge and insight they need to prepare themselves for a healthy psychosexual development. Further research is needed to investigate how this increased knowledge and insight can subsequently ameliorate improvements in romantic skills and prevent the development of problematic sexual behavior and victimization.","Visser Kirsten, Greaves-Lord Kirstin, Tick Nouchka T, Verhulst Frank C, Maras Athanasios, van der Vegt Esther J M","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","Adolescent, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Cognitive Remediation, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice, Humans, Male, Outcome Assessment, Health Care, Sex Education, Social Behavior","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28276079","Yulius Academy, Yulius Organization for Mental Health, Barendrecht, The Netherlands.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry/psychology, Erasmus MC-Sophia, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.",

In an earlier phase 2 trial; bumetanide reduced the severity of ASD in children and adolescents (3-11 years old). Here we report the results of a multicenter phase 2B study primarily to assess dose/response and safety effects of bumetanide. Efficacy outcome measures included the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), the Social Responsive Scale (SRS) and the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Improvement scale (CGI-I). Eighty-eight patients with ASD spanning across the entire pediatric population (2-18 years old) were subdivided in four age groups and randomized to receive bumetanide (0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 mg twice daily) or placebo for 3 months. The mean CARS value was significantly improved in the completers group (P: 0.015). Also, 23 treated children had more than a six-point improvement in the CARS compared with only one placebo-treated individual. Bumetanide significantly improved CGI (P: 0.0043) and the SRS score by more than 10 points (P: 0.02). The most frequent adverse events were hypokalemia, increased urine elimination, loss of appetite, dehydration and asthenia. Hypokalemia occurred mainly at the beginning of the treatment at 1.0 and 2.0 mg twice-daily doses and improved gradually with oral potassium supplements. The frequency and incidence of adverse event were directly correlated with the dose of bumetanide. Therefore, bumetanide improves the core symptoms of ASD and presents a favorable benefit/risk ratio particularly at 1.0 mg twice daily.","Lemonnier E, Villeneuve N, Sonie S, Serret S, Rosier A, Roue M, Brosset P, Viellard M, Bernoux D, Rondeau S, Thummler S, Ravel D, Ben-Ari Y","Translational psychiatry","Adolescent, Anorexia, Asthenia, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Bumetanide, Child, Child, Preschool, Dehydration, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Female, Humans, Hypokalemia, Male, Sodium Potassium Chloride Symporter Inhibitors, Treatment Outcome","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28291262","CHU hoputal Le Cluzeau, Hôpital Sainte Marguerite, Marseille, France.; CHU hoputal Le Cluzeau, Neurochlore Research Team, Marseille, France.; CHU hoputal Le Cluzeau, CHU Lenval, Nice, France.; CHU hoputal Le Cluzeau, CHU Limoges, Limoges, France.; CHU hoputal Le Cluzeau, CHU le Vinatier, Bron, France.; CHU hoputal Le Cluzeau, CHRU Brest, Brest, France.; CHU hoputal Le Cluzeau, CHU Le Rouvray, Sotteville les Rouen, France.",

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has demonstrated promise in addressing EF deficits in adult neuropsychiatric disorders. This article will outline the design of a novel randomized-controlled trial of bilateral, 20 Hz, rTMS applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for treatment of EF deficits in ASD that is currently ongoing. We describe prior therapeutic rTMS research for ASD and prior rTMS trials targeting EFs in adult neuropsychiatric disorders. A neurophysiological rationale for rTMS treatment of EF deficits in ASD is presented. An ongoing protocol will enroll participants aged 16-35 with ASD and no intellectual disability. Psychotropic medications will be continued during the 4-week trial of active 20 Hz versus sham rTMS applied to the DLPFC. Twenty, active treatment sessions consisting of 25 stimulation trains at a 90% motor threshold will be administered. The primary outcome measure is the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) spatial working memory task. At present, recruitment, enrollment, and treatment within the described clinical trial are ongoing. EF deficits are common and impairing symptoms of ASD. There are no evidence-based treatments for EF deficits in ASD.

Previous oxytocin studies are male biased and often constrained by task-based inferences. Here, we investigate the impact of oxytocin on resting-state connectivity between subcortical and cortical networks in women. We collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data on 26 typically developing women 40 min following intranasal oxytocin administration using a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design. Independent components analysis (ICA) was applied to examine connectivity between networks. An independent analysis of oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene expression in human subcortical and cortical areas was carried out to determine plausibility of direct oxytocin effects on OXTR. In women, OXTR was highly expressed in striatal and other subcortical regions, but showed modest expression in cortical areas. Oxytocin increased connectivity between corticostriatal circuitry typically involved in reward, emotion, social communication, language and pain processing. This effect was 1.39 standard deviations above the null effect of no difference between oxytocin and placebo. This oxytocin-related effect on corticostriatal connectivity covaried with autistic traits, such that oxytocin-related increase in connectivity was stronger in individuals with higher autistic traits. In sum, oxytocin strengthened corticostriatal connectivity in women, particularly with cortical networks that are involved in social-communicative, motivational and affective processes. This effect may be important for future work on neurological and psychiatric conditions (for example, autism), particularly through highlighting how oxytocin may operate differently for subsets of individuals.","Bethlehem R A I, Lombardo M V, Lai M-C, Auyeung B, Crockford S K, Deakin J, Soubramanian S, Sule A, Kundu P, Voon V, Baron-Cohen S","Translational psychiatry","Administration, Intranasal, Adult, Affect, Cerebral Cortex, Communication, Connectome, Corpus Striatum, Double-Blind Method, Female, Gene Expression, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Middle Aged, Motivation, Nerve Net, Receptors, Oxytocin, Social Behavior, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28418398","Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.; Department of Psychiatry, Autism Research Centre, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.; Brain Imaging Center, Icahn Institute of Medicine at Mt.

The neuropeptide oxytocin triggers anxiolytic functions and enhances eye gaze, facial emotion recognition and neural correlates of face processing in ASD. Here we investigated whether a single dose of oxytocin increases attention to faces in ASD. As a secondary question, we explored the influence of social anxiety on these effects. We tested for oxytocin's effects on attention to neutral faces as compared to houses in a sample of 29 autistic individuals and 30 control participants using a dot-probe paradigm with two different presentation times (100 or 500 ms). A single dose of 24 IU oxytocin was administered in a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Under placebo, ASD individuals paid less attention to faces presented for 500 ms than did controls. Oxytocin administration increased the allocation of attention toward faces in ASD to a level observed in controls. Secondary analyses revealed that these oxytocin effects primarily occurred in ASD individuals with high levels of social anxiety who were characterized by attentional avoidance of faces under placebo. Our results confirm a positive influence of intranasal oxytocin on social attention processes in ASD. Further, they suggest that oxytocin may in particular restore the attentional preference for facial information in ASD individuals with high social anxiety.

The primary outcome measures included parent-completed questionnaires, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), and frequency of eye contact, which was measured with the partial interval recording method. After completing treatment, the eye contact percentages were significantly increased in both groups. For facial emotion recognition, the percentages of correct answers were increased in similar patterns in both groups compared to baseline (P > 0.05), with no difference between the TG and CG (P > 0.05). The subjects' ability to play, general behavioral and emotional symptoms were significantly diminished after treatment (p < 0.05). These results showed that the robot-facilitated and human-facilitated behavioral interventions had similar positive effects on eye contact and facial emotion recognition, which suggested that robots are useful mediators of social skills training for children with ASD.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of BRAVE-ONLINE in HFASD children with an anxiety disorder. Forty-two HFASD children, aged 8-12 years, with an anxiety disorder, and their parents, were randomly assigned to either the BRAVE-ONLINE condition (NET) or a waitlist control (WLC). Diagnostic interviews and parent/child questionnaires were completed at pre-treatment, post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. At post- assessment, compared to children in the WLC condition, children in the NET condition demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in number of anxiety diagnoses, clinical severity of diagnosis, and self and parent reported anxiety symptoms, as well as significantly greater increases in overall functioning. However, loss of primary diagnosis in this sample was lower than in previous studies. The small sample size, coupled with attrition rates, makes it difficult to generalise the findings of the study to HFASD population and to conduct analyses regarding mediators, moderators and predictors of outcomes. The BRAVE-ONLINE program may be useful in reducing anxiety symptoms in HFASD children, although the effects are less strong than those found in neurotypical children for a variety of reasons.","Conaughton Rebecca J, Donovan Caroline L, March Sonja","Journal of affective disorders","Anxiety, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Comorbidity, Female, Humans, Internet, Male, Parents, Surveys and Questionnaires, Telemedicine, Treatment Outcome, Waiting Lists","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28477505","School of Applied Psychology, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Mount Gravatt Campus, Mount Gravatt, QLD 4122, Australia.

The atypical antipsychotic lurasidone, whose mechanism of action differs from SSRIs and other standard antidepressants, was shown in a 6-week randomized, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled study (n=209), to be effective in treating major depressive disorder (MDD) with mixed features (subthreshold hypomanic symptoms). This post-hoc analysis assessed the efficacy of lurasidone in this study by menopausal status. The main outcome measure for this post-hoc analysis was change in MADRS score from baseline to week 6 endpoint for two lurasidone-treated subgroups: presumptive pre-menopausal (<52years) and presumptive post-menopausal (≥52years) patients, compared to placebo treatment, using a mixed-model for repeated-measures analysis, and calculation of the effect size for each subgroup. Additional efficacy assessments included the CGI-S, HAM-A and YMRS. An exploratory analysis was also conducted removing presumptive peri-menopausal women (ages 45-51years) to allow for clearer definition of pre- and post-menopausal status. A total of 56 lurasidone-treated and 47 placebo-treated pre-menopausal females, and 17 lurasidone-treated and 25 placebo-treated post-menopausal females were available from the larger study for comparison on key outcome measures. The pre- and post-menopausal subgroups had similar demographic and clinical characteristics at study baseline (other than age), including number of past major depressive episodes as well as depressive and manic symptom severity. Mean daily lurasidone dose was similar for each subgroup during the study. Both the primary and exploratory analyses showed that both lurasidone-treated post-menopausal and pre-menopausal females responded significantly compared to placebo (p=0.016 or less) on the MADRS, and that post-menopausal patients had a numerically larger response (effect size=0.96) than pre-menopausal patients (effect size=0.64). All other secondary outcome measures for lurasidone compared with placebo treatment were significant (p=0.045 or less) for both subgroups.

A waiting-list control design was employed. The children received 1 year of home-based EIBI for approximately 20 hours a week, their parents functioning as primary therapists. The waiting-list control group consisted of seven children who were tested 6 months before the intervention commenced. The intervention was based on the University of California at Los Angeles Young Autism Project model (UCLA YAP; Lovaas, 1981, 1987, 2003). The Psychoeducational Profile (3rd ed., PEP-3), the Parenting Stress Index (PSI), and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (2nd ed., CARS 2) were used to measure outcome. In addition, a mental developmental index (MDI) was calculated on the basis of the Cognitive Verbal/Preverbal subscale of the PEP-3. After 1 year of EIBI, we found a significant increase in the PEP-3 scores and MDI scores as well as a significant reduction in the CARS 2 scores. No significant changes were seen when participants were on the waiting list. The stress level of the parents did not change significantly and in fact showed overall a slight decrease. This model of providing EIBI appears to hold some promise. Comprehensive parental involvement did not affect their stress level.

This RCT evaluated the efficacy of one technology-based early intervention programme (Therapy Outcomes By You; TOBY) in young children with ASD. TOBY is an app-based learning curriculum designed for children and parents as a complement to early behavioural intervention. Eighty children (16 female) were recruited to this RCT within 12 months of receiving a diagnosis of ASD (M age = 3.38; SD = 0.69) and randomised to receive either treatment-as-usual (community-based intervention, n = 39) or the TOBY therapy (at least 20 min/day) plus treatment-as-usual (n = 41) for a period of 6 months. Outcomes were assessed at 3 and 6 months postbaseline. (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12614000738628; www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=365463). Children in the TOBY intervention group averaged 19 min/day engaging with the app in the first 3 months, but only 2 min/day during the second 3 months. There was no group difference in scores on the primary outcome, the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist, at either the 3- or 6-month follow-up. However, significant improvements at the 6-month follow-up were observed in the TOBY intervention group relative to the treatment-as-usual group on three secondary outcomes: the Fine Motor and Visual Reception subscales of the Mullen Scale of Early Learning and the Total Words Understood scale of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Index. Statistical trends towards improvement in the TOBY intervention group were observed on measures of adaptive function, although these decreased in magnitude from the 3- to 6-month follow-up. This study provides evidence that technology-based interventions may provide a relatively low-cost addition to existing therapist-delivered interventions for children with ASD. However, sustained use of the app over the full 6-month period was a challenge for most families.","Whitehouse Andrew J O, Granich Joanna, Alvares Gail, Busacca Margherita, Cooper Matthew N, Dass Alena, Duong Thi, Harper Rajes, Marshall Wendy, Richdale Amanda, Rodwell Tania, Trembath David, Vellanki Pratibha, Moore Dennis W, Anderson Angelika","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","Autism Spectrum Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Child, Preschool, Computers, Handheld, Early Medical Intervention, Female, Humans, Male, Outcome Assessment, Health Care, Therapy, Computer-Assisted","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28543302","Telethon Kids Institute, The University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia.; Autism West, Perth, WA, Australia.; Griffith Health Institute, Griffith University, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.; School of Information Technology, Deakin University, Geelong, Vic., Australia.; Olga Tennison Autism Research Centre, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Vic., Australia.; Krongold Centre, Faculty of Education, Monash University, Melbourne, Vic., Australia.",

Secondary outcomes included parent- and teacher-rated adaptive behaviors, trainer-rated global functioning and clinical severity, and self-reported child and caregiver stress. Assessments were made at baseline, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up. Moderator analyses were conducted for age and gender. Significant treatment effects on the primary outcome were limited to parent ratings for the adolescent subgroup (posttreatment: -8.3; 95% CI = -14.2 to -1.9; p = .012, effect size [ES] = 0.32; follow-up: -8.6; 95% CI = -15.4 to -1.8; p = .015, ES = 0.33) and females (posttreatment: -8.9; 95% CI = -16.2 to -1.6; p = .019, ES = 0.40).

In total, 529 participants completed the Impact of Event Scale Revised (IES-R) (pre e post treatment). In order to provide a comparison similar to a waitlist-like control group, a method of cohort analysis was applied. In addition, possible time dependent effect was tested. ET (early-treated sample, participants treated within one month after the earthquake) and LT (late-treated sample, participants treated after the first month from the earthquake) reported at post-treatment an improvement to a level below the IES-R cutoff (65.8% of the ET sample and 64.02% of the LT sample). Control group analogue and time-outcome correlation suggest that positive changes in symptoms were likely due to the treatment provided and not merely to the time lapse from the traumatic event.

Prognosis is poor, in part, because existing medications target only associated ASD features. Emerging evidence suggests that the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) may be a blood-based biomarker of social functioning and a possible treatment for ASD. However, prior OXT treatment trials have produced equivocal results, perhaps because of variability in patients' underlying neuropeptide biology, but this hypothesis has not been tested. Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design, we tested the efficacy and tolerability of 4-wk intranasal OXT treatment (24 International Units, twice daily) in 32 children with ASD, aged 6-12 y. When pretreatment neuropeptide measures were included in the statistical model, OXT compared with placebo treatment significantly enhanced social abilities in children with ASD [as measured by the trial's primary outcome measure, the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS)]. Importantly, pretreatment blood OXT concentrations also predicted treatment response, such that individuals with the lowest pretreatment OXT concentrations showed the greatest social improvement. OXT was well tolerated, and its effects were specific to social functioning, with no observed decrease in repetitive behaviors or anxiety. Finally, as with many trials, some placebo-treated participants showed improvement on the SRS. This enhanced social functioning was mirrored by a posttreatment increase in their blood OXT concentrations, suggesting that increased endogenous OXT secretion may underlie this improvement. These findings indicate that OXT treatment enhances social abilities in children with ASD and that individuals with pretreatment OXT signaling deficits may stand to benefit the most from OXT treatment.","Parker Karen J, Oztan Ozge, Libove Robin A, Sumiyoshi Raena D, Jackson Lisa P, Karhson Debra S, Summers Jacqueline E, Hinman Kyle E, Motonaga Kara S, Phillips Jennifer M, Carson Dean S, Garner Joseph P, Hardan Antonio Y","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","Administration, Inhalation, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Female, Humans, Male, Oxytocics, Oxytocin, Social Skills","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28696286","Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.; Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305; kjparker@stanford.edu.",

Little is known, however, about its effects on nonsocial manifestations, such as restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. In the empathizing-systemizing theory of autism, social deficits are described along the continuum of empathizing ability, whereas nonsocial aspects are characterized in terms of an increased preference for patterned or rule-based systems, called systemizing. We therefore developed an automated eye-tracking task to test whether children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared to matched controls display a visual preference for more highly organized and structured (systemized) real-life images. Then, as part of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, we examined the effect of intranasal oxytocin on systemizing preferences in 16 male children with ASD, compared with 16 matched controls. Participants viewed 14 slides, each containing four related pictures (e.g., of people, animals, scenes, or objects) that differed primarily on the degree of systemizing. Visual systemizing preference was defined in terms of the fixation time and count for each image. Unlike control subjects who showed no gaze preference, individuals with ASD preferred to fixate on more highly systemized pictures. Intranasal oxytocin eliminated this preference in ASD participants, who now showed a similar response to control subjects on placebo. In contrast, control participants increased their visual preference for more systemized images after receiving oxytocin versus placebo. These results suggest that, in addition to its effects on social communication, oxytocin may play a role in some of the nonsocial manifestations of autism.","Strathearn Lane, Kim Sohye, Bastian D Anthony, Jung Jennifer, Iyengar Udita, Martinez Sheila, Goin-Kochel Robin P, Fonagy Peter","Development and psychopathology","Administration, Intranasal, Adolescent, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Choice Behavior, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Fixation, Ocular, Humans, Male, Oxytocin, Pattern Recognition, Visual","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28712371","Baylor College of Medicine.; University of Iowa.",

Such impairment may underlie core deficits in cognition and social functioning. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to enhance WM in both healthy adults and clinical populations, but its efficacy in ASD is unknown. We predicted that bifrontal tDCS would improve WM performances of adults with high-functioning autism during active stimulation compared to sham stimulation and that such enhancement would generalize to an untrained task. Twelve adults with high-functioning ASD engaged in a battery of WM tasks that included backward spatial span, backward digit span, spatial <i>n</i>-back and letter <i>n</i>-back. While engaged, 40 min of 1.5 mA bifrontal stimulation was applied over the left and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC). Using a single-blind crossover design, each participant received left anodal/right cathodal stimulation, right anodal/left cathodal stimulation, or sham stimulation, in randomized counterbalanced order on three separate days. Following tDCS, participants again engaged in letter and spatial <i>n</i>-back tasks before taking the Brief Test of Attention (BTA). We used repeated-measures ANOVA to compare overall performance on the WM battery as measured by a composite of <i>z</i>-scores for all five measures. Post hoc ANOVAs, <i>t</i> tests, Friedman's tests, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to measure the online and offline effects of tDCS and to assess performances on individual measures. Compared to sham stimulation, both left DLPFC anodal stimulation (<i>t</i><sub>11</sub> = 5.4, <i>p</i> = 0.0002) and right DLPFC anodal stimulation (<i>t</i><sub>11</sub> = 3.57, <i>p</i> = 0.004) improved overall WM performance. Left anodal stimulation (<i>t</i><sub>11</sub> = 3.9, <i>p</i> = 0.003) and right anodal stimulation (<i>t</i><sub>11</sub> = 2.7, <i>p</i> = 0.019) enhanced performances during stimulation.

Higher doses of lurasidone were notably more effective than lower doses in patients with more severe agitation at study baseline. In this pooled analysis of 5 short-term studies, lurasidone provided early and sustained reduction in agitation, assessed using the PANSS-EC score, in patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia.

We used data from a randomized trial that tested the efficacy of the ESDM, which is based on developmental and applied behavioral analytic principles and delivered by trained therapists and parents, for 2 years. Parents were interviewed about their children's service use every 6 months from the onset of the intervention to follow-up (age 6 years). The sample for this study consisted of 39 children with autism who participated in the original randomized trial at age 18 to 30 months, and were also assessed at age 6 years. Of this sample, 21 children were in the ESDM group, and 18 children were in the community care (COM) group. Reported services were categorized and costed by applying unit hourly costs. Annualized service use and costs during the intervention and post intervention for the two study arms were compared. During the intervention, children who received the ESDM had average annualized total health-related costs that were higher by about $14,000 than those of children who received community-based treatment. The higher cost of ESDM was partially offset during the intervention period because children in the ESDM group used less applied behavior analysis (ABA)/early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) and speech therapy services than children in the comparison group. In the postintervention period, compared with children who had earlier received treatment as usual in community settings, children in the ESDM group used less ABA/EIBI, occupational/physical therapy, and speech therapy services, resulting in significant cost savings in the amount of about $19,000 per year per child. Costs associated with ESDM treatment were fully offset within a few years after the intervention because of reductions in other service use and associated costs.

This physician-blinded, prospective, randomized controlled trial investigated an association between the anticonvulsant drug levetiracetam and SEDs in children with ASD. A total of 70 children with ASD (4-6 years) and SEDs identified by electroencephalogram were randomly divided into two equal groups to receive either levetiracetam and educational training (treatment group) or educational training only (control). At baseline and after 6 months treatment, the following scales were used to assess each individual's behavioral and cognitive functions: the Chinese version of the Psychoeducational Profile - third edition (PEP-3), Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), and Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC). A 24-hour electroencephalogram was recorded on admission (baseline) and at follow-up. The degree of satisfaction of each patient was also evaluated. Relative to baseline, at the 6-month follow-up, the PEP-3, CARS, and ABC scores were significantly improved in both the treatment and control groups. At the 6-month follow-up, the PEP-3 scores of the treatment group were significantly higher than those of the control, whereas the CARS and ABC scores were significantly lower, and the rate of electroencephalographic normalization was significantly higher in the treatment group. Levetiracetam appears to be effective for controlling SEDs in pediatric patients with ASD and was also associated with improved behavioral and cognitive functions.","Wang Minjian, Jiang Li, Tang Xiaoju","Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28919764","Department of Neurology, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, People's Republic of China.; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders.; Department of Psychology.",

One question to be answered is how enduring its neuromodulatory effect could be. Twenty-four patients with ASD (mean age: 12.2 years) received 20 sessions of NIBS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC). They were randomized into two groups with two (G1) or three (G2) clinical evaluations before NIBS. Both groups had a complete follow-up at six months after the intervention, with the aim of determining the short-term outcome using the total score on the Autism Behavior Checklist, Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist, and the Autism Diagnostic Interview. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) was used in ASD patients aged <11 years, and repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) for 11-13-year-olds. Observation points were at one, three, and six months after completing all the sessions of NIBS. A significant reduction in the total score on the three clinical scales was observed and maintained during the first six months after treatment, with a slight and non-significant tendency to increase the scores in the last evaluation.

A randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study was designed to investigate the effect of 8 weeks of supplementation with ω3 (962mg/d and 1155mg/d for children and adolescents, respectively). Sixty-eight children and adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) completed the full protocol. Primary outcome measures were erythrocyte membrane FA composition and TAS. Secondary outcome measures were Social Responsiveness Scale and Clinical Global Impression-Severity. Treatment with ω3 improved the erythrocyte membrane ω6/ω3 ratio (treatment effect p<0.008, d=0.66; within subjects effect p<0.007, d=0.5) without changing TAS. There was a within subjects significant improvement in Social Motivation and Social Communication subscales scores, with a moderate to large effect size (p=0.004, d=0.73 and p=0.025, d=0.79 respectively), but no treatment effect (treatment-placebo order). Carryover effects cannot be discarded as responsible for the results in behavioral measures. In conclusion, supplementation with ω3 FA might be studied as an add-on to behavioral therapies in ASD.

The present study describes the results of a 16-week open-label extension. Fifty-two participants from the acute trial (85%) entered the extension; 22 had been on metformin during the initial RCT and 30 had been on placebo. Participants were re-titrated to 500 mg twice a day (6- to 9-year-olds) or 850 mg twice a day (10- to 17-year-olds) during the open-label extension. Primary outcome measure was change in body mass index (BMI) z-score after 16 weeks; secondary outcomes were change in additional body composition and metabolic parameters. After 16 weeks of open-label treatment, participants initially taking placebo during the RCT had lower BMI z-scores (mean 16-week change -0.10, p = .004). Statistically significant improvements also were noted in secondary body composition measures (weight z-score and BMI and weight percentile) but not in metabolic variables. Participants who initially had been taking metformin during the 16-week RCT maintained prior decreases in BMI z-scores but did not have additional weight loss. Three participants discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. No significant changes were noted on metabolic measures, although the decrease in hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> was large (∼1 mmol) and consistent across the acute and open-label phases.

Lorazepam (3 mg) intravenously (n = 47) or placebo (n = 43) in addition to haloperidol (2 mg) intravenously upon the onset of an agitation episode. The primary outcome was change in Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) score (range, -5 [unarousable] to 4 [very agitated or combative]) from baseline to 8 hours after treatment administration. Secondary end points were rescue neuroleptic use, delirium recall, comfort (perceived by caregivers and nurses), communication capacity, delirium severity, adverse effects, discharge outcomes, and overall survival. Among 90 randomized patients (mean age, 62 years; women, 42 [47%]), 58 (64%) received the study medication and 52 (90%) completed the trial.

A total of 125 children and adolescents (2-17.5 years of age; 96.8% ASD, 3.2% Smith-Magenis syndrome [SMS]) whose sleep failed to improve on behavioral intervention alone were randomized (1:1 ratio), double-blind, to receive PedPRM (2 mg escalated to 5 mg) or placebo for 13 weeks. Sleep measures included the validated caregivers' Sleep and Nap Diary (SND) and Composite Sleep Disturbance Index (CSDI). The a priori primary endpoint was SND-reported total sleep time (TST) after 13 weeks of treatment. The study met the primary endpoint: after 13 weeks of double-blind treatment, participants slept on average 57.5 minutes longer at night with PedPRM compared to 9.14 minutes with placebo (adjusted mean treatment difference PedPRM-placebo -32.43 minutes; p = .034). Sleep latency (SL) decreased by 39.6 minutes on average with PedPRM and 12.5 minutes with placebo (adjusted mean treatment difference -25.30 minutes; p = .011) without causing earlier wakeup time. The rate of participants attaining clinically meaningful responses in TST and/or SL was significantly higher with PedPRM than with placebo (68.9% versus 39.3% respectively; p = .001) corresponding to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 3.38. Overall sleep disturbance (CSDI) tended to decrease. PedPRM was generally safe; somnolence was more commonly reported with PedPRM than placebo. PedPRM was efficacious and safe for treatment of insomnia in children and adolescents with ASD with/without ADHD and NGD.

This article summarizes the clinical implications; reanalyzes the data to examine the utility of 4 criteria for deciding to augment; and presents a treatment algorithm. The newly analyzed 4 criteria for augmenting after 3 weeks of stimulant and PT treatment consisted of not meeting a Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) score of 1 and a normal score (≤15) on the Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form Disruptive-Total (D-Total); a CGI-I score of 1 or 2 plus 25% improvement in D-Total score; a D-Total score no higher than 15; and a CGI-Severity score of 3 (mild) or better. Effect sizes were calculated. Prior TOSCA publications were reviewed for clinically relevant findings. All 4 criteria resulted in medium or better effect sizes (d = 0.59-0.72) when comparing risperidone with placebo. Providing risperidone to children who did not reach a CGI-I score of 1 plus a D-Total score no higher than 15 resulted in the greatest benefit. In addition, a review of clinically relevant data suggests that stimulant plus PT shows further improvement after 3 weeks even without augmentation. For those children who did not attain a CGI-I score of 1 and a D-total score no higher than 15, adding risperidone maximized the number of children benefitting from treatment and the average amount of benefit. Unless clinical circumstances dictate otherwise, practitioners should delay an antipsychotic drug for at least 1 month after the optimal stimulant dose is achieved and PT has commenced.

To achieve better quality of unbiased evidence for the effectiveness of ASD interventions, it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive review that covers studies with adequate quality standards, such as randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and different types of intervention In this study, we categorize interventions for ASD as behavioural, social-communication focused, and multimodal developmental based on Howlin's classification of early interventions for children with ASD. The aim of this study was to compare these three models and investigate the strengths and weaknesses of each type of intervention and to identify the approaches that contribute to a successful outcome for children with autism. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. We included RCTs targeting children with ASD 6 years old or younger. A random effects model was used to present the effect estimate for the outcomes. This study also performed combined meta-analyses of all the three models to investigate the overall effectiveness of the intervention programmes. 32 randomized controlled studies were found to be eligible for inclusion. The synthesized data included 594 children from 14 RCTs. There was no statistically significant difference in the effects on autism general symptoms between the social-communication-focused model and the multimodal developmental model (p = 0.83). The results suggest that there is evidence of an effect on 'reciprocity of social interaction towards others' (standard mean difference [95% confidential interval] = 0.53[0.29,0.78], p<0.01) and 'parental synchrony' (SMD = 0.99[0.70,1.29], p<0.01). The small number of studies included in the present study limited the ability to make inferences when comparing the three models and investigating the strengths and weaknesses of each type of intervention with respect to important outcomes. Since the outcome of 'reciprocity of social interaction towards others' could be a dependent variable that might be context-bound to interactions with the child's parent, we cannot conclude the interventions for pre-school children with ASD have significant effects on a generalized skill to engage in reciprocal interactions with others. However, the outcomes of 'reciprocity of social interaction towards others' and 'parental synchrony' may be promising targets for interventions involving pre-school children with ASD.

This study examined the efficacy of cognitive enhancement therapy (CET) for improving core cognitive and employment outcomes in adult autism. Verbal adult outpatients with autism spectrum disorder (N = 54) were randomized to an 18-month, single-blind trial of CET, a cognitive remediation approach that integrates computer-based neurocognitive training with group-based training in social cognition, or an active enriched supportive therapy (EST) comparison focused on psychoeducation and condition management. Primary outcomes were composite indexes of neurocognitive and social-cognitive change. Competitive employment was a secondary outcome. Intent-to-treat analyses indicated that CET produced significant differential increases in neurocognitive function relative to EST (d = .46, P = .013). Both CET and EST were associated with large social-cognitive improvements, with CET demonstrating an advantage at 9 (d = .58, P = 0.020), but not 18 months (d = .27, P = 0.298). Effects on employment indicated that participants treated with CET were significantly more likely to gain competitive employment than those in EST, OR = 6.21, P = 0.023, which was mediated by cognitive improvement. CET is a feasible and potentially effective treatment for core cognitive deficits in adult autism spectrum disorder.

A double-blind cross-over study on the effect of fenfluramine versus placebo in seven autistic boys over a period of 8 months demonstrated a significant decrease in blood serotonin levels during the fenfluramine phase in all subjects. Slight improvements were found in short-term auditory memory and some measures of receptive language skills, particularly in children functioning at a high level. There was no significant change in global psychometric measurements of general intelligence during therapy. No adverse clinical effect was observed other than weight loss of 6% in one child.

The objective of the current study was to identify the MCID for RASS using 2 anchor-based approaches. The current study was a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial to compare the effect of lorazepam versus placebo as an adjuvant to haloperidol for persistent agitation in patients with delirium. The primary outcome was change in RASS (10-point numeric rating scale ranging from -5 [unarousable] to +4 [combative]) from baseline to 8 hours after treatment administration. The sensitivity-specificity and within-patient change methods were used to identify the MCID, with the anchor being patient comfort after the study intervention as perceived by caregivers and nurses. A total of 90 patients were randomized and 58 (64%) received the study medication for restlessness/agitation (mean baseline RASS, 1.6). A total of 23 caregivers (61%) and 23 nurses (55%) perceived that the patient was more comfortable after treatment. Using the sensitivity-specificity method, the optimal RASS reduction was ≥4 points according to both caregivers (sensitivity of 61% and specificity of 80%; area under the curve, 0.71) and nurses (sensitivity of 73% and specificity of 84%; area under the curve, 0.78). The RASS cutoff value based on the within-patient change method was similar (-4.2 for caregivers and -4.0 for nurses). For patients with persistent restlessness/agitation, a reduction of ≥4 points in RASS was considered to be the MCID for both nurses and caregivers.

In a randomized three-phase crossover study, 13 healthy volunteers received single doses of 30 mg nadolol orally with water (control), or an aqueous solution of EGCG-concentrated green tea extract (GTE) at low or high dose. Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of nadolol were determined up to 48 h. In addition, blood pressure and pulse rate were monitored. In vitro transport kinetic experiments were performed using human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably expressing organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1A2 to evaluate the inhibitory effect of EGCG on OATP1A2-mediated substrate transport. Single coadministration of low and high dose GTE significantly reduced the plasma concentrations of nadolol. The geometric mean ratios with 90% CI for area under the plasma concentration-time curves from 0 to infinity of nadolol were 0.72 (0.56-0.87) for the low and 0.60 (0.51-0.69) for the high dose. There were no significant differences in T<sub>max</sub>, elimination half-life, and renal clearance between GTE and water phases.

The objectives of the pilot Preemie Tots Trial were 1) to confirm the feasibility of a full-scale trial in toddlers born very preterm and exhibiting ASD symptoms and 2) to explore the effects of supplementation on parent-reported ASD symptoms and related behaviors. This was a 90-d randomized, fully blinded, placebo-controlled trial in 31 children 18-38 mo of age who were born at ≤29 wk of gestation. One group was assigned to daily Omega-3-6-9 Junior (Nordic Naturals, Inc.) treatment (including 338 mg eicosapentaenoic acid, 225 mg DHA, and 83 mg GLA), and the other group received canola oil (124 mg palmitic acid, 39 mg stearic acid, 513 mg linoleic acid, 225 mg α-linolenic acid, and 1346 mg oleic acid). Mixed-effects regression analyses followed intent-to-treat analysis and explored effects on parent-reported ASD symptoms and related behaviors.

Outcomes were not significantly different based on dose of treatment. Comparing parent training to treatment-as-usual did not result in significantly different treatment effects than when parent training was compared to an active comparison group.

This pilot study addresses this void by investigating neural and behavioral changes in a Phase I trial in young adults with high-functioning ASD who received an evidence-based behavioral intervention, Virtual Reality-Social Cognition Training over 5 weeks for a total of 10 hr. The participants were tested pre- and post-training with a validated biological/social versus scrambled/nonsocial motion neuroimaging task, previously shown to activate regions within the social brain networks. Three significant brain-behavior changes were identified. First, the right posterior superior temporal sulcus, a hub for socio-cognitive processing, showed increased brain activation to social versus nonsocial stimuli in individuals with greater gains on a theory-of-mind measure. Second, the left inferior frontal gyrus, a region for socio-emotional processing, tracked individual gains in emotion recognition with decreased activation to social versus nonsocial stimuli. Finally, the left superior parietal lobule, a region for visual attention, showed significantly decreased activation to nonsocial versus social stimuli across all participants, where heightened attention to nonsocial contingencies has been considered a disabling aspect of ASD. This study provides, albeit preliminary, some of the first evidence of the harnessable neuroplasticity in adults with ASD through an age-appropriate intervention in brain regions tightly linked to social abilities.

Prenatal interventions to ameliorate that risk have yet to be established for clinical use. A systematic review of prenatal nutrients and childhood emotional development and later mental illness was performed. Randomized trials of folic acid, phosphatidylcholine, and omega-3 fatty acid supplements assess effects of doses beyond those adequate to remedy deficiencies to promote normal fetal development despite genetic and environmental risks. Folic acid to prevent neural tube defects is an example. Vitamins A and D are currently recommended at maximum levels, but women's incomplete compliance permits observational studies of their effects. Folic acid and phosphatidylcholine supplements have shown evidence for improving childhood emotional development associated with later mental illnesses. Vitamins A and D decreased the risk for schizophrenia and autism in retrospective observations. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation during early pregnancy increased the risk for schizophrenia and increased symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but in later pregnancy it decreased childhood wheezing and premature birth. Studies are complicated by the length of time between birth and the emergence of mental illnesses like schizophrenia, compared with anomalies like facial clefts identified at birth. As part of comprehensive maternal and fetal care, prenatal nutrient interventions should be further considered as uniquely effective first steps in decreasing risk for future psychiatric and other illnesses in newborn children.

Beside these core symptoms, it is suggested that up to 60% of children with ASD suffer from comorbid anxiety disorders which may further affect educational, social and general development as well as quality of life. The main goal of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a manualized cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) anxiety program adapted for children with ASD. This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Fifty children with ASD and anxiety, aged 7 to 13 years, will be randomly assigned to group CBT or a wait-list control (WL) condition. The design will follow a two (CBT and WL) by two (pre-post assessment) mixed between-within design. The control group will receive intervention after the waitlist period of 13 weeks. Primary outcomes are diagnostic status and severity of the anxiety disorders, measured with The Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule for DSM-IV, Parent and Child Versions. Secondary outcomes are parent and child ratings on questionnaires on the child's level of anxiety and impact on everyday life. Additional outcomes entail information gathered from parents, child and teachers on the child's behavior and negative self-statements, together with social and adaptive skills. Follow-up data will be collected 3 months after intervention. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a manualized CBT program in Danish children with ASD and anxiety within a mental health clinic setting. The hypothesis is that training anxiety reduction skills will decrease anxiety in children, as well as ensure better psychosocial development for the child in general. https://ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT02908321 ).

During Phase 2, all participants took open-label metformin from week 17 through week 32. We assessed spatial and verbal memory using the Neuropsychological Assessment 2nd Edition (NEPSY-II) and a modified children's verbal learning task. No measures differed between participants randomized to metformin versus placebo, at either 16 or 32 weeks, after adjustment for multiple comparisons. Sixteen-week change in memory for spatial location on the NEPSY-II was nominally better among participants randomized to placebo. However, patterns of treatment response across all measures revealed no systematic differences in performance, suggesting that metformin had no effect on spatial or verbal memory in these children.

The purpose of the present study was to examine the efficacy of a manualized and individually delivered 10-session, transdiagnostic CBT intervention, aimed at improving emotion regulation and mental health difficulties in children with ASD. Sixty-eight children (M age = 9.75, SD = 1.27) and their parents participated in the study, randomly allocated to either a treatment immediate (n = 35) or waitlist control condition (n = 33) (ISRCTN #67079741). Parent-, child-, and clinician-reported measures of emotion regulation and mental health were administered at baseline, postintervention/postwaitlist, and at 10-week follow-up. Children in the treatment immediate condition demonstrated significant improvements on measures of emotion regulation (i.e., emotionality, emotion regulation abilities with social skills) and aspects of psychopathology (i.e., a composite measure of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, adaptive behaviors) compared to those in the waitlist control condition. Treatment gains were maintained at follow-up. This study is the first transdiagnostic CBT efficacy trial for children with ASD.

PT was weekly for 10 weeks, and then monthly. ATX/placebo was titrated over 6 weeks [≤1.8 mg/kg/d], and then maintained until week 10. Responders continued to week 34 or nonresponse. Placebo nonresponders had a 10-week ATX open trial; ATX nonresponders were treated clinically. All continued to week 34. With no further treatment from the study, all were invited to follow-up (FU) at 1.5 years postbaseline; 94 (73%) participated.

Using transcranial magnetic stimulation, we assessed cortical excitability, long-term depression (LTD)-like neuroplasticity in 45 GDM-exposed and 12 control children aged 11-13 years. Data were analysed against salivary cortisol and maternal diabetes severity and treatment (insulin [N = 22] or metformin [N = 23]) during pregnancy. GDM-exposed children had reduced cortical excitability (p = .003), LTD-like neuroplasticity (p = .005), and salivary cortisol (p < .001) when compared with control children. Higher maternal insulin resistance (IR) before and during GDM treatment was associated with a blunted neuroplastic response in children (p = .014) and this was not accounted for by maternal BMI. Additional maternal and neonatal measures, including fasting plasma glucose and inflammatory markers, predicted neurophysiological outcomes. The metformin and insulin treatment groups had similar outcomes. These results suggest that GDM can contribute to subtle differences in child neurophysiology, and possibly cortisol secretion, persisting into early adolescence. Importantly, these effects appear to occur during second trimester, before pharmacologic treatment typically commences, and can be predicted by maternal insulin resistance. Therefore, earlier detection and treatment of GDM may be warranted. Metformin appears to be safe for these aspects of neurodevelopment.","Van Dam Jago M, Garrett Amy J, Schneider Luke A, Hodyl Nicolette A, Goldsworthy Mitchell R, Coat Suzette, Rowan Janet A, Hague William M, Pitcher Julia B","EBioMedicine","Adolescent, Autistic Disorder, Cerebral Cortex, Child, Diabetes, Gestational, Female, Humans, Hydrocortisone, Male, Neurodevelopmental Disorders, Neuronal Plasticity, Pregnancy, Saliva, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29709497","Robinson Research Institute, Adelaide Medical School, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia 5006, Australia.; Robinson Research Institute, Adelaide Medical School, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia 5006, Australia.

At present, there are no curative or psychopharmacological therapies to effectively treat all symptoms of the disorders. Early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) is a treatment based on the principles of applied behavior analysis. Delivered for multiple years at an intensity of 20 to 40 hours per week, it is one of the more well-established treatments for ASD. This is an update of a Cochrane review last published in 2012. To systematically review the evidence for the effectiveness of EIBI in increasing functional behaviors and skills, decreasing autism severity, and improving intelligence and communication skills for young children with ASD. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, 12 additional electronic databases and two trials registers in August 2017. We also checked references and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. Randomized control trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) in which EIBI was compared to a no-treatment or treatment-as-usual control condition. Participants must have been less than six years of age at treatment onset and assigned to their study condition prior to commencing treatment. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.We synthesized the results of the five studies using a random-effects model of meta-analysis, with a mean difference (MD) effect size for outcomes assessed on identical scales, and a standardized mean difference (SMD) effect size (Hedges' g) with small sample correction for outcomes measured on different scales. We rated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We included five studies (one RCT and four CCTs) with a total of 219 children: 116 children in the EIBI groups and 103 children in the generic, special education services groups. The age of the children ranged between 30.2 months and 42.5 months. Three of the five studies were conducted in the USA and two in the UK, with a treatment duration of 24 months to 36 months. All studies used a treatment-as-usual comparison group.Primary outcomesThere is low quality-evidence at post-treatment that EIBI improves adaptive behaviour (MD 9.58 (assessed using Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS) Composite; normative mean = 100, normative SD = 15), 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.57 to 13.60, P < 0.0001; 5 studies, 202 participants), and reduces autism symptom severity (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.79 to 0.11, P = 0.14; 2 studies, 81 participants; lower values indicate positive effects) compared to treatment as usual.No adverse effects were reported across studies.Secondary outcomesThere is low-quality evidence at post-treatment that EIBI improves IQ (MD 15.44 (assessed using standardized IQ tests; scale 0 to 100, normative SD = 15), 95% CI 9.29 to 21.59, P < 0.001; 5 studies, 202 participants); expressive (SMD 0.51, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.90, P = 0.01; 4 studies, 165 participants) and receptive (SMD 0.55, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.87, P = 0.001; 4 studies, 164 participants) language skills; and problem behaviour (SMD -0.58, 95% CI -1.24 to 0.07, P = 0.08; 2 studies, 67 participants) compared to treatment as usual. There is weak evidence that EIBI may be an effective behavioral treatment for some children with ASD; the strength of the evidence in this review is limited because it mostly comes from small studies that are not of the optimum design. Due to the inclusion of non-randomized studies, there is a high risk of bias and we rated the overall quality of evidence as 'low' or 'very low' using the GRADE system, meaning further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.It is important that providers of EIBI are aware of the current evidence and use clinical decision-making guidelines, such as seeking the family's input and drawing upon prior clinical experience, when making recommendations to clients on the use EIBI. Additional studies using rigorous research designs are needed to make stronger conclusions about the effects of EIBI for children with ASD.","Reichow Brian, Hume Kara, Barton Erin E, Boyd Brian A","The Cochrane database of systematic reviews","Behavior Therapy, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Child, Preschool, Communication, Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic, Early Intervention, Educational, Early Medical Intervention, Humans, Intelligence","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29742275","Anita Zucker Center for Excellence in Early Childhood Studies, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.",

The primary outcome was the Social Responsiveness Scale-Second Edition (SRS-2) rated by parents and blinded teachers. Secondary outcomes included parent- and teacher-rated adaptive behaviors, trainer-rated global functioning and clinical severity, and self-reported child and caregiver stress.

Sulforaphane, a supplement with indirect antioxidant effects that are derived from broccoli sprouts and seeds, was recently shown to lead to improvements in behavior and social responsiveness in children with ASD. We conducted the current open-label study to determine if we could identify changes in urinary metabolites that were associated with clinical improvements with the goal of identifying a potential mechanism of action. Children and young adults enrolled in a school for children with ASD and related neurodevelopmental disorders were recruited to participate in a 12-week, open-label study of sulforaphane. Fasting urinary metabolites and measures of behavior (Aberrant Behavior Checklist-ABC) and social responsiveness (Social Responsiveness Scale-SRS) were measured at baseline and at the end of the study. Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated for the pre- to post-intervention change in each of the two clinical scales (ABS and SRS) versus the change in each metabolite. Fifteen children completed the 12-week study. Mean scores on both symptom measures showed improvements (decreases) over the study period, but only the change in the SRS was significant. The ABC improved - 7.1 points (95% CI - 17.4 to 3.2), and the SRS improved - 9.7 points (95% CI - 18.7 to - 0.8). We identified 77 urinary metabolites that were correlated with changes in symptoms, and they clustered into pathways of oxidative stress, amino acid/gut microbiome, neurotransmitters, hormones, and sphingomyelin metabolism.

Some studies suggest that individual characteristics such as diagnosis (i.e., specific deficit clusters) or behavioral profiles may be important social outcome moderators. Given the interactive nature of group-based interventions, understanding how individual characteristics combine to influence outcomes for the group as a whole is an important next step. By using a multisite cluster randomized control trial (n = 274), the current study explores the impact that varying student characteristics have on outcomes of the Social Competence Intervention for Adolescents (SCI-A; Stichter, Herzog, Owens, & Malugen, 2016; Stichter et al., 2010) compared to outcomes of business-as-usual (BAU) practices. Researchers hypothesized that (a) SCI-A would be more effective than BAU in improving ratings of students' social functioning when students within groups were more similar to each other on relevant diagnostic and behavioral indicators, and (b) that within SCI-A only, more versus less homogenous groups would demonstrate greater social outcome gains. Results offer some support for these hypotheses: SCI-A was more effective in improving social communication and motivation when groups were diagnostically similar (ds > 0.55). Considering changes in social awareness and communication, SCI-A was more effective when groups were heterogeneous on socially competent behavior (ds > 1.32) and less effective when groups were heterogeneous on antisocial behavior (ds > 1.00). The authors discuss the implications and importance of research exploring factors such as group composition that may moderate intervention response in applied settings.

We enrolled 32 autistic children, rTMS group ( <i>n</i> = 16) and control group ( <i>n</i> = 16) and calculated the relative power of the δ, θ, α, β rhythms in each brain area by fast Fourier transform and Welch's method. We also compared Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) scores of the patients before and after rTMS. The results showed a significant decrease in the relative power of the δ band on right temporal region and parietal region and also a decreased coherence on frontal region after rTMS intervention. The study proves that rTMS could have positive effects on behavior of attention, execution ability, and language ability of children and could reduce their stereotyped behavior and radical behavior.","Tong Zhen, Ding Meng, Li Xiaoli, Cai Erjuan, Kang Jiannan","Sheng wu yi xue gong cheng xue za zhi = Journal of biomedical engineering = Shengwu yixue gongchengxue zazhi","Autistic Disorder, Beta Rhythm, Brain, Child, Electroencephalography, Humans, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29938939","Institute of Electronic Information Engineering, Hebei University, Baoding, Hebei 071000, P.R.China.kangjiannan81@163.com.; State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, P.R.China.; Institute of Electronic Information Engineering, Hebei University, Baoding, Hebei 071000, P.R.China.; Institute of Electrical Engineering, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, Hebei 066004, P.R.China.",

In this randomized, parallel-group, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in Japan, 106 ASD individuals (18-48 y.o.) were enrolled between Jan 2015 and March 2016. Participants were randomly assigned to a 6-week intranasal oxytocin (48IU/day, n = 53) or placebo (n = 53) group. One-hundred-three participants were analyzed. Since oxytocin reduced the primary endpoint, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) reciprocity, (from 8.5 to 7.7; P < .001) but placebo also reduced the score (8.3 to 7.2; P < .001), no between-group difference was found (effect size -0.08; 95% CI, -0.46 to 0.31; P = .69); however, plasma oxytocin was only elevated from baseline to endpoint in the oxytocin-group compared with the placebo-group (effect size -1.12; -1.53 to -0.70; P < .0001). Among the secondary endpoints, oxytocin reduced ADOS repetitive behavior (2.0 to 1.5; P < .0001) compared with placebo (2.0 to 1.8; P = .43) (effect size 0.44; 0.05 to 0.83; P = .026).

No significant effects were observed for the other secondary endpoints. No significant difference in the prevalence of adverse events was observed between groups, although one participant experienced temporary gynecomastia during oxytocin administration.

It can also be used for behavioral healthcare applications, such as for children with developmental disorders who exhibit difficulties with the behavior, by providing awareness through the visual feedback from the partner&rsquo;s device. Two laboratory experiments showed the device&rsquo;s detection range and response time, tested with a pair of dummy heads. Another laboratory experiment was done with human participants with gaze trackers and showed the device&rsquo;s substantial agreement with a human observer. We then conducted two field studies involving children with intellectual disabilities and/or autism spectrum disorders. The first study showed that the devices could be used in the school setting, observing the children did not remove the devices. The second study showed that the durations of children&rsquo;s face-to-face behavior could be increased under a visual feedback condition.

While there are no specific pharmacological or other physical treatments for autism, in recent years repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), a technique for non-invasive neuromodulation, has attracted interest due to potential therapeutic value. Here we report the results of a systematic literature review and meta-analysis on the use of rTMS to treat ASD. <b>Methods:</b> We performed a systematic literature search on PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, Bielefeld Academic Search, and Educational Resources Information Clearinghouse. Search terms reflected diagnoses and treatment modalities of interest. Studies reporting use of rTMS to treat core ASD or cognitive symptoms in ASD were eligible. Two researchers performed article selection and data extraction independently, according to PRISMA guidelines. Changes in ASD clinical scores or in cognitive performance were the main outcomes. Random effects meta-analysis models were performed. <b>Results:</b> We found 23 eligible reports, comprising 4 case-reports, 7 non-controlled clinical trials, and 12 controlled clinical trials, comparing the effects of real TMS with waiting-list controls (<i>n</i> = 6) or sham-treatment (<i>n</i> = 6). Meta-analyses showed a significant, but moderate, effect on repetitive and stereotyped behaviors, social behavior, and number of errors in executive function tasks, but not other outcomes. Most studies had a moderate to high risk of bias, mostly due to lack of subject- and evaluator-blinding to treatment allocation. Only 5 studies reported stability of these gains for periods of up 6 months, with descriptions that improvements were sustained over time. <b>Conclusions:</b> Existing evidence supports that TMS could be useful to treat some dimensions of ASD. However, such evidence must be regarded with care, as most studies did not adequately control for placebo effects. Moreover, little is known regarding the most effective stimulation parameters, targets, and schedules. There is an urgent need for further randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trials, with adequate follow-up periods, to test the efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation to treat these disorders. Available evidence must be regarded as preliminary and insufficient, at present, to support offering TMS to treat ASD.","Barahona-Corrêa J Bernardo, Velosa Ana, Chainho Ana, Lopes Ricardo, Oliveira-Maia Albino J","Frontiers in integrative neuroscience",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30038561","CADIN-Neurodesenvolvimento e Inclusão, Cascais, Portugal.; Champalimaud Clinical Centre, Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown, Lisbon, Portugal.; Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health, Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Ocidental, Lisbon, Portugal.; Centro de Investigação e de Intervenção Social (CIS-IUL), Instituto Universitário de Lisboa (ISCTE-IUL), Lisbon, Portugal.",

Therefore, we assessed the impact of exclusion diets and a 6-week Bimuno® galactooligosaccharide (B-GOS®) prebiotic intervention in 30 autistic children. The results showed that children on exclusion diets reported significantly lower scores of abdominal pain and bowel movement, as well as lower abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. and Veillonellaceae family, but higher presence of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bacteroides spp. In addition, significant correlations were found between bacterial populations and faecal amino acids in this group, compared to children following an unrestricted diet.

Trauma-related diagnoses such as acute stress disorder (ASD) or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may exacerbate suicide risk, particularly among service members psychiatrically hospitalized following suicide-related events. To date, treatments to address suicide risk and trauma symptomatology among service members within inpatient milieus have been nonexistent. To address this gap, a randomized controlled pilot trial of Post-Admission Cognitive Therapy (PACT) was conducted to evaluate a targeted cognitive-behavioral program among traumatized military personnel (N = 36) hospitalized following a recent suicide attempt. All participants met criteria for ASD or PTSD and were randomly assigned to receive either PACT and enhanced usual care (PACT + EUC) or EUC alone. PACT consisted of six 60- to 90-min individual psychotherapy sessions, adapted from Brown et al.'s (2005) cognitive therapy protocol for suicide prevention. Blinded follow-up assessments were conducted at 1-, 2-, and 3-months postpsychiatric discharge. The primary outcome was days until repeat suicide attempt. Secondary outcomes included depression, hopelessness, suicide ideation, and PTSD symptoms. Participants did not significantly differ in reattempt status. However, based on reliable change index analyses, a greater proportion of PACT + EUC versus EUC participants met criteria for clinically significant change on measures of depression (100% vs. 78%), hopelessness (83% vs. 57%), and PTSD symptom severity (100% vs. 38%), but not for suicide ideation (60% vs. 67%).

Patients meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for MDD, who presented with 2 or 3 protocol-specified manic symptoms, were randomized to 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with flexible doses of either lurasidone 20-60 mg/d (n = 109) or placebo (n = 100). The study was conducted between September 2011 and October 2014. Change in sexual functioning was assessed utilizing the 14-item self-report Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire (CSFQ-14) administered at baseline and week 6 endpoint. Change from baseline to week 6 in depression severity was assessed utilizing the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. Lurasidone significantly reduced mean MADRS total scores at week 6 endpoint (-20.5 vs -13.0; P < .001). Treatment with lurasidone was associated with significant endpoint improvement in CSFQ total scores versus placebo (+5.1 vs +3.1; P < .05). Fewer patients treated with lurasidone versus placebo shifted from normal to abnormal sexual function. The proportion of patients with a baseline-to-endpoint shift from normal to abnormal sexual function was smaller for lurasidone versus placebo (1.9% vs 4.3%; CSFQ criteria) at study endpoint. Use of higher lurasidone doses was not associated with greater impairment in sexual functioning. No treatment-emergent adverse events related to sexual function were reported during lurasidone treatment.

Currently, there is no US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for these core symptoms. This article reviews the biological origins of the social function deficit associated with autism spectrum disorder and the drug therapies with the potential to treat this deficit. A review of the history of autism demonstrates that a deficit in social interaction has been the defining feature of the concept of autism from its conception. Abnormalities identified in early social skill development and an overview of the pathophysiology abnormalities associated with autism spectrum disorder are discussed as are the abnormalities in brain circuits associated with the social function deficit. Previous and ongoing clinical trials examining agents that have the potential to improve social deficits associated with autism spectrum disorder are discussed in detail. This discussion reveals that agents such as oxytocin and propranolol are particularly promising and undergoing active investigation, while other agents such as vasopressin agonists and antagonists are being activity investigated but have limited published evidence at this time. In addition, agents such as bumetanide and manipulation of the enteric microbiome using microbiota transfer therapy appear to have promising effects on core autism spectrum disorder symptoms including social function. Other pertinent issues associated with developing treatments in autism spectrum disorder, such as disease heterogeneity, high placebo response rates, trial design, and the most appropriate way of assessing effects on social skills (outcome measures), are also discussed.","Frye Richard E","CNS drugs","Autism Spectrum Disorder, Bumetanide, Disease Progression, Fecal Microbiota Transplantation, Humans, Social Behavior Disorders, Social Skills, Sodium Potassium Chloride Symporter Inhibitors, Vasopressins","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30105528","Division of Neurodevelopmental Disorders, Department of Neurology, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix Children's Hospital, 1919 E Thomas St, Phoenix, AZ, 85016, USA. rfrye@phoenixchildrens.com.",

However, the relative contribution of these mechanisms to the redeployment of the most exercise-responsive cell types is largely unknown. We determined the lymphocyte and monocyte subtypes mobilized to blood during exercise via β<sub>2</sub>-AR signaling whilst controlling for β<sub>1</sub>-AR mediated reductions in hemodynamic forces. In a randomized, double blind, complete cross-over design, 14 healthy cyclists exercised for 30-minutes at +10% of blood lactate threshold after ingesting: (1) a placebo, (2) a β<sub>1</sub>-preferential antagonist (10 mg bisoprolol), or (2) a non-preferential β<sub>1</sub> + β<sub>2</sub>-antagonist (80 mg nadolol) across three trials separated by >7-days. Bisoprolol was administered to reduce hemodynamic forces (heart rate and blood pressure) during exercise to levels comparable with nadolol but without blocking β<sub>2</sub>-ARs. The mobilization of total NK-cells, terminally differentiated (CD57+) NK-cells, central memory, effector memory and CD45RA+ effector memory CD8+ T-cells; non-classical monocytes; and γδ T-cells were significantly blunted or abrogated under nadolol compared to both bisoprolol and placebo, indicating that the exercise-induced mobilization of these cell types to the blood is largely influenced by β<sub>2</sub>-AR signaling. Nadolol failed to inhibit the mobilization of classical monocytes, CD4+ T-cells (and their subsets) or naïve CD8+ T-cells, indicating that these cell types are mobilized with exercise independently of the β<sub>2</sub>-AR. We conclude that the preferential mobilization of NK-cells, non-classical monocytes and differentiated subsets of CD8+ T-cells with exercise is largely dependent on catecholamine signaling through the β<sub>2</sub>-AR. These findings provide mechanistic insights by which distinct lymphocyte and monocyte subtypes are preferentially mobilized to protect the host from anticipated injury or infection in response to an acute stress response.","Graff Rachel M, Kunz Hawley E, Agha Nadia H, Baker Forrest L, Laughlin Mitzi, Bigley Austin B, Markofski Melissa M, LaVoy Emily C, Katsanis Emmanuel, Bond Richard A, Bollard Catherine M, Simpson Richard J","Brain, behavior, and immunity","Adult, Bisoprolol, CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes, Catecholamines, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Exercise, Female, Healthy Volunteers, Humans, Killer Cells, Natural, Lymphocyte Activation, Male, Monocytes, Nadolol, Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-2, Signal Transduction","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30172948","Laboratory of Integrated Physiology, Department of Health and Human Performance, University of Houston, 3875 Holman Street, Houston, TX, USA.; Laboratory of Integrated Physiology, Department of Health and Human Performance, University of Houston, 3875 Holman Street, Houston, TX, USA; Department of Nutritional Sciences, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA; Department of Immunobiology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.; Laboratory of Integrated Physiology, Department of Health and Human Performance, University of Houston, 3875 Holman Street, Houston, TX, USA; Department of Nutritional Sciences, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA; Department of Immunobiology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA; Department of Behavioral Sciences, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.

We included placebo-controlled clinical trials and cohort studies comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. We also included the following types of post-licensure analyses: case-control studies, self-controlled case series, and multivariate risk factor analyses. We conducted an electronic search of PubMed from inception through August 2013, and reviewed Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices statements, vaccine package inserts, and previously published reviews to identify studies. Scientific Information Packets were requested from vaccine manufacturers. We reviewed the methodology of the 2011 Institute of Medicine (IOM) consensus report ""Adverse Effects of Vaccines: Evidence and Causality"" and accepted their findings. We augmented their work with new studies and additional vaccines. For studies not included in the IOM report, we abstracted data on the presence or absence of adverse health outcomes, characteristics of patients, study design, and vaccine description, including brand, potency, dosage, timing, and formulation, where available. We excluded formulations not used in the United States. The McHarm instrument was used to evaluate the quality of adverse events collection and reporting in each study. We were unable to pool results; we rated the overall strength of evidence (SOE) as high, moderate, low, or insufficient by using guidance suggested by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality for its Effective Health Care Program. A total of 20,478 titles were identified; after title, abstract, and full-text review, 166 studies were accepted for abstraction. The vast majority of studies either did not investigate or could not identify risk factors for adverse events (AEs) associated with vaccination. Similarly, the severity of AEs was inconsistently reported, as was information that would make independent severity determination possible. SOE was high for the following associations in nonpregnant adults: seasonal influenza vaccine and arthralgia, myalgia, malaise, fever, pain at injection site; 2009 monovalent H1N1 vaccine and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS); and a lack of association between influenza and pneumococcal vaccines and cardiovascular events in the elderly. Risk of GBS was estimated at 1.6 excess cases per million persons vaccinated. SOE was high for the following associations in children and adolescents: measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and febrile seizures in children under age 5; lack of association between MMR vaccine and autism spectrum disorders; and varicella vaccine and disseminated Oka strain varicella zoster virus with associated complications (i.e., meningitis, encephalitis) in individuals with demonstrated immunodeficiencies. There is moderate SOE that vaccines against rotavirus are associated with intussusception in children; risk was estimated as 1 to 5 cases per 100,000 vaccine doses, depending on brand. Moderate-strength evidence exists regarding human papillomavirus vaccine and a lack of association with onset of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and GBS. Moderate-strength evidence shows no association between inactivated influenza vaccine and serious AEs in pregnant women. Evidence was insufficient to make conclusions regarding whether several routinely recommended vaccines are associated with serious conditions such as multiple sclerosis, transverse myelitis, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. There is evidence that some vaccines are associated with serious adverse events; however, these events are extremely rare and must be weighed against the protective benefits that vaccines provide. Careful consideration should be given to the investigation of research gaps, including patient risk factors that may be associated with AEs; however, important factors must be taken into account when determining whether studies are warranted, including the severity and frequency of the AE being studied and the challenges of conducting sufficiently powered studies when investigating rare events.","Maglione Margaret A, Gidengil Courtney, Das Lopamudra, Raaen Laura, Smith Alexandria, Chari Ramya, Newberry Sydne, Hempel Susanne, Shanman Roberta, Perry Tanja, Goetz Matthew Bidwell","Evidence report/technology assessment","Vaccines, Immunization, United States, Humans, Child, Adolescent, Young Adult, Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30257278","Southern California Evidence-based Practice Center.",

Medial prefrontal transcript expression levels were analyzed in adult male C57BL/6J mice after intraperitoneal injection of oxytocin or saline either once (200 ng/100 μL/mouse, n = 12) or for 14 consecutive days (200 ng/100 μL/mouse/day, n = 16). As the results, repeated administration of oxytocin significantly decreased the medial prefrontal N-acetylaspartate (NAA; p = 0.043) and glutamate-glutamine levels (Glx; p = 0.001), unlike the acute oxytocin. The decreases were inversely and specifically associated (r = 0.680, p = 0.004 for NAA; r = 0.491, p = 0.053 for Glx) with oxytocin-induced improvements of medial prefrontal functional MRI activity during a social judgment task not with changes during placebo administrations. In wild-type mice, we found that repeated oxytocin administration reduced medial frontal transcript expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor type 2B (p = 0.018), unlike the acute oxytocin, which instead changed the transcript expression associated with oxytocin (p = 0.0004) and neural activity (p = 0.0002).

Whereas evidence from animal models emphasizes the critical role of the ventral striatum in the behavioral effects of oxytocin, region-specific contributions of the basal ganglia have not been systematically explored in humans. The present study combined the randomized placebo-controlled administration of oxytocin versus placebo in healthy men (n = 144) with fMRI-based resting-state functional connectivity to determine the modulatory role of oxytocin on the major basal ganglia pathways. Oxytocin specifically increased connectivity between ventral striatal and pallidal nodes with upstream frontal regions, whereas it decreased the strengths of downstream pathways between the dorsal striatum and posterior cerebellum. These pathways have previously been implicated in salience, reward and behavioral flexibility, thus shaping goal-directed behavior. Given the importance of aberrant striatal intrinsic organization in autism, addiction and schizophrenia the present findings may suggest new mechanistic perspectives for the therapeutic potential of oxytocin in these disorders.","Zhao Zhiying, Ma Xiaole, Geng Yayuan, Zhao Weihua, Zhou Feng, Wang Jiaojian, Markett Sebastian, Biswal Bharat B, Ma Yina, Kendrick Keith M, Becker Benjamin","NeuroImage","Adult, Brain Mapping, Cerebellum, Corpus Striatum, Frontal Lobe, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Neural Pathways, Oxytocin, Ventral Striatum, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30266264","The Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, MOE Key Laboratory for Neuroinformation, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.; The Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, MOE Key Laboratory for Neuroinformation, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China; Department of Biomedical Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA.; The Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, MOE Key Laboratory for Neuroinformation, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.

Cervical total disc replacement (TDR) could reduce the stress of adjacent segments and retard ASD in theory, but the superiority has not been determined yet. This analysis aimed that whether TDR was superior to ACDF for decreasing adjacent segment degeneration (ASDeg) and adjacent segment disease (ASDis). A meta-analysis was performed according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Collaboration with PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and CBM (China Biological Medicine) databases. It included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that reported ASDeg, ASDis, and reoperation on adjacent segments after TDR and ACDF. Two investigators independently selected trials, assessed methodological quality, and evaluated the quality of this meta-analysis using the grades of recommendation, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) approach. Eleven studies with 2632 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The overall rate of ASD in TDR group was lower than ACDF group (OR = 0.6; 95% CI [0.38, 0.73]; P < 0.00001). Both the incidence of ASDeg and the reoperation rate were statistically lower in the TDR group than in the ACDF group (OR = 0.58, P < 0.00001; OR = 0.52, P = 0.01, respectively). Subgroup analysis was performed according to the follow-up time and trial site; the rate of ASDeg was lower in patients underwent TDR no matter the follow-up time, and TDR tended to increase the superiority across time. The rate of ASDeg was also lower with TDR both in the USA and China (P < 0.0001, P = 0.03, respectively). But the cost-effectiveness result might be prone to neither of the two surgery approaches. According to GRADE, the overall quality of this meta-analysis was moderate. TDR decreased the rates of ASDeg and reoperation compared with that of ACDF, and the superiority may become more apparent over time.

However, little is known if and how ASD specific behavioral interventions may affect neural processing in ASD. The aim of the current study was to investigate for the first time, whether the group-based social skills training SOSTA-FRA would elicit changes in neurophysiological correlates of social perception in high-functioning ASD individuals aged 8-17 years. Event-related potentials (ERPs) of a facial emotion recognition (FER) and a biological motion perception task were examined. ERPs were compared between a randomized intervention and a treatment as usual group at three time points (baseline, post-intervention, and at 3 months follow-up). A reduction of P100 amplitude in the right hemisphere and a trend toward reduced N200 latency in the biological motion task were found after the training only in the intervention group, whereas behavioral performance remained stable. Change in N200 latencies and parent-rated social responsiveness showed small but statistically nonsignificant correlations. No changes were observed regarding FER. Results indicate that the intervention changed neural correlates of social perception in ASD. Especially neural correlates of biological motion perception, which is an important prerequisite for successful social interaction, were sensitive to change. ERPs of social perception tasks that are impaired in ASD can well be used to objectively measure neural processing improvement by behavioral intervention. Autism Res 2018, 11: 1376-1387. © 2018 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: It is well known that people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) process social information differently than other people and that these differences can also be seen in their brain activity. We also know that behavioral therapies, such as group-based social skills trainings can help people with ASD improve their behavior. But it is unclear how therapy changes social processing in the brain. The aim of our study was therefore to examine how neural processing of social stimuli changed after behavioral intervention. Comparing a group of children and adolescents that received the group-based social skills training SOSTA-FRA to a control group we found that the neural processing of human motion became faster and involved less brain resources after the intervention, while behavioral performance remained stable. No changes were seen for the processing of emotional facial expressions. We recommend that future studies should also analyze changes in brain function as well as behavioral changes as a secondary therapy outcome parameter.","Luckhardt Christina, Kröger Anne, Elsuni Leyla, Cholemkery Hannah, Bender Stephan, Freitag Christine M","Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research","Adolescent, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Child, Evoked Potentials, Facial Recognition, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Motion Perception, Parents, Social Perception, Social Skills","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30324710","Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy, Autism Research and Intervention Center of Excellence, University Hospital Frankfurt, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.",

Differences were predicted on the verbal fluency (VF) test and a test of social skills (TASSK-M) for verum (2.0 mA) vs. sham tDCS, which was randomly assigned in a within-subjects, double-blinded design in adults with ASD with normal or higher cognitive functioning. The anode electrode was placed over right temporoparietal (CP6) and cathode over ipsilateral deltoid. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for paired data indicated that participants received a significantly higher score on the VF test after receiving verum tDCS compared to sham tDCS, with no significant differences found on the TASSK-M. Post-hoc analysis showed that the emotion-word portion of the VF test, specifically, indicated significant differences when comparing verum to sham tDCS conditions.

Although the exact neural mechanisms are unclear, oxytocin has been shown to enhance motivation and attention to social stimuli, suggesting a potential to augment social reinforcement learning as the central mechanism of behavioral interventions in ASD. We tested how reinforcement learning in social contexts and associated reward prediction error (RPE) signals in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) were modulated by intranasal oxytocin. Male adults with a childhood diagnosis of ASD (n = 15) and healthy controls (n = 24; aged 18-26 years) performed a probabilistic reinforcement learning task during functional magnetic resonance imaging in a single-center (research center in Germany), randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial. The interventions were intranasal oxytocin (Syntocinon<sup>®</sup>, Novartis; 10 puffs = 20 international units (IUs) per treatment) and placebo spray. Using computational modeling of behavioral data, trial-by-trial RPE signals were assessed and related to brain activation in NAcc during reinforcing feedback in social and non-social contexts. The order of oxytocin/placebo was randomized for 60 participants. Twenty-one participants were excluded from analyses, leaving 39 for the final analysis. Behaviorally, individuals with ASD showed enhanced learning under oxytocin when the learning target as well as feedback was social as compared to non-social (social vs. non-social target: 87.09% vs. 71.29%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 7.28-24.33, p = .003; social vs. non-social feedback: 81.00% vs. 71.29%, 95% CI: 2.81-16.61, p = .027). Correspondingly, oxytocin enhanced the correlation of the RPE signal with NAcc activation during social (vs. non-social) feedback in ASD (3.48 vs. -1.12, respectively, 95% CI: 2.98-6.22, p = .000), whereas in controls, this effect was found in the placebo condition (2.90 vs. -1.14, respectively, 95% CI: 1.07-7.01, p = .010). In ASD, a similar pattern emerged when the learning target was social (3.00 vs. -0.64, respectively, 95% CI: -0.13 to 7.41, p = .057), whereas controls showed a reduced correlation for social learning targets under oxytocin (-0.70 vs. 2.72, respectively, 95% CI: -5.86 to 0.98, p = .008). The current data suggest that intranasal oxytocin has the potential to enhance social reinforcement learning in ASD.

TOSCA was a randomized clinical trial evaluating the effect of placebo versus risperidone when added to PT and psychostimulant for childhood ADHD with severe aggression. Data for 167 parents and children 6-12 years old with ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) or conduct disorder, and severe physical aggression were examined. Analyses used generalized linear models. Most parents (72%) attended seven or more of nine sessions. The average parental engagement, that is, the percentage of PT elements fully achieved across participants and sessions, was 85%. The average therapist rating of goal completion was 92%. Parents of non-white and/or Hispanic children (p = 0.01) and children with lower intelligence quotient (p = 0.02) had lower PT attendance; parents with lower family incomes (p = 0.01) were less engaged. Attendance and engagement predicted better scores on the primary child behavior outcomes of disruptive behavior (Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form Disruptive Behavior Total) and ADHD and ODD symptoms, adjusting for baseline severity. When the clinical picture is sufficiently severe to warrant prescribing an atypical antipsychotic, PT is feasible for families of children with ADHD and co-occurring severe aggression. The promotion of attendance and engagement in PT is important to enhance clinical outcomes among this challenging population.

This 12-week study included 5 weeks of probiotic-prebiotic supplementation, followed by a two-week washout period, and 5 weeks of prebiotic only supplementation. The primary outcome of tolerability was assessed using validated questionnaires of GI function and atypical behaviors, along with side effects. Results suggest that the combination treatment is well-tolerated in this cohort. The most common side effect was mild gassiness. Some participants on both treatments saw a reduction in the frequency of certain GI symptoms, as well as reduced occurrence of particular aberrant behaviors. Improvement may be explained by a reduction in IL-13 and TNF-α production in some participants. Although limited conclusions can be drawn from this small pilot study, the results support the need for further research into the efficacy of these treatments.","Sanctuary Megan R, Kain Jennifer N, Chen Shin Yu, Kalanetra Karen, Lemay Danielle G, Rose Destanie R, Yang Houa T, Tancredi Daniel J, German J Bruce, Slupsky Carolyn M, Ashwood Paul, Mills David A, Smilowitz Jennifer T, Angkustsiri Kathleen","PloS one","Animals, Autistic Disorder, Cattle, Child, Child, Preschool, Colostrum, Double-Blind Method, Female, Gastrointestinal Diseases, Humans, Interleukin-13, Male, Prebiotics, Probiotics, Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625189","Department of Neurobiology, Physiology and Behavior, University of California, Davis, California, United States of America.; MIND Institute, University of California Davis, Sacramento, California, United States of America.; Department of Pediatrics, University of California School of Medicine, Sacramento, California, United States of America.; Department of Food Science and Technology, University of California, Davis, California, United States of America.; USDA ARS Western Human Nutrition Research Center, Davis, California, United States of America.; Department of Nutrition, University of California, Davis, California, United States of America.",

Although repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has been studied for neurodevelopmental disorders, there is no clear consensus on its therapeutic effects. This systematic review examined literature on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for children and adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders published up to 2018 using the PubMed database. The search identified 264 articles and 14 articles met eligibility criteria. Twelve of these studies used conventional repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and two studies used theta burst stimulation. No severe adverse effects were reported in these studies. In patients with autism spectrum disorder, low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and intermittent theta burst stimulation applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may have therapeutic effects on social functioning and repetitive behaviors. In patients with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation applied to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may target inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. In patients with tic disorders, low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation applied to the bilateral supplementary motor area improved tic symptom severity. This systematic review suggests that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation may be a promising intervention for children and adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders.

We systematically reviewed the efficacy and harms of pharmacologic treatments for sleep disorders in children and adolescents. We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane library databases, and PsycINFO through June 2018. We included 22 placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (1-13 weeks' duration), involving 1758 children (mean age 8.2 years). Single randomized controlled trials of zolpidem and eszopiclone in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) showed no improvement in sleep or ADHD ratings. Clinical Global Impression Improvement/Severity scores significantly improved with zolpidem ( P = .03 and P = .006, respectively). A single, small randomized controlled trial of diphenhydramine reported small improvements in sleep outcomes (8-10 minutes' better sleep latency and duration) after 1 week. In 19 randomized controlled trials, melatonin significantly improved sleep latency (median 28 minutes; range 11-51 minutes), sleep duration (median 33 minutes; range 14-68 minutes), and wake time after sleep onset (range 12-43 minutes), but not number of awakenings per night (range 0-2.7). Function and behavior improvement varied. Improvement in sleep was greatest in children with autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders, and smaller in adolescents and children with chronic delayed sleep onset. Adverse events were infrequent with melatonin, but more frequent than placebo in children taking eszopiclone or zolpidem. These findings show that melatonin was useful in improving some sleep outcomes in the short term, particularly those with comorbid ASD and neurodevelopmental disorders.

A three-arm 16-week, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, adjunctive to usual treatment, was conducted. Participants (n = 181) with bipolar disorder and current depressive symptoms were randomised to 2000 mg/day NAC (n = 59), 2000 mg/day NAC with the combination nutraceutical treatment (CT, n = 61), or placebo (n = 61).

This can have major implications in child development, receptivity to behavioral therapy, as well as child and caregiver well-being. A systematic review and network meta-analysis were conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of atypical antipsychotics in treating irritability in these patients. Studies were identified from Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO from inception to March 2018. The clinical trials database was reviewed. Studies were included if they were a double-blind, randomized controlled trial utilizing the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability (ABC-I) to measure the efficacy of atypical antipsychotic monotherapy. Data extraction was carried out following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses for network meta-analysis guidelines. The main outcome was the reduction in irritability score using the ABC-I subscale from baseline. Eight trials comparing four interventions-risperidone, aripiprazole, lurasidone, and placebo in 878 patients, were included. Both risperidone and aripiprazole had significantly reduced ABC-I scores than placebo. Estimates of mean differences (95% credible intervals) were risperidone, -6.89 (-11.14, -2.54); aripiprazole, -6.62 (-10.88, -2.22); and lurasidone, -1.61 (-9.50, 6.23). Both risperidone and aripiprazole had similar safety. There were only eight studies included in the analysis, however, sample sizes were not small. Variance in reporting of adverse effects limited the quality of safety analysis. Risperidone and aripiprazole were the two best drugs, with comparable efficacy and safety in pediatric ASD patients.

As a secondary objective of the VIDOMA (Vitamin D and Omega-3 in ASD) trial, we evaluated the efficacy of vitamin D, omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid [omega-3 LCPUFA; docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)], or both on irritability and hyperactivity. New Zealand children with ASD (aged 2.5-8 years) participated in a 12-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D (2000 IU/day, VID), omega-3 LCPUFA (722 mg/day DHA, OM), or both (2000 IU/day vitamin D + 722 mg/day DHA, VIDOM). The primary outcomes were the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist (ABC) domains of irritability and hyperactivity. Biomarkers (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and omega-3 index) and primary outcomes were measured at baseline and 12-months.

However, before launching large-scale clinical trials, a better understanding of the effects of CBD on brain would be desirable. Preclinical evidence suggests that one aspect of the polypharmacy of CBD is that it modulates brain excitatory glutamate and inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels, including in brain regions linked to ASD, such as the basal ganglia (BG) and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC). However, differences in glutamate and GABA pathways in ASD mean that the response to CBD in people with and without ASD may be not be the same. To test whether CBD 'shifts' glutamate and GABA levels; and to examine potential differences in this response in ASD, we used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure glutamate (Glx = glutamate + glutamine) and GABA+ (GABA + macromolecules) levels in 34 healthy men (17 neurotypicals, 17 ASD). Data acquisition commenced 2 h (peak plasma levels) after a single oral dose of 600 mg CBD or placebo. Test sessions were at least 13 days apart. Across groups, CBD increased subcortical, but decreased cortical, Glx. Across regions, CBD increased GABA+ in controls, but decreased GABA+ in ASD; the group difference in change in GABA + in the DMPFC was significant. Thus, CBD modulates glutamate-GABA systems, but prefrontal-GABA systems respond differently in ASD. Our results do not speak to the efficacy of CBD. Future studies should examine the effects of chronic administration on brain and behaviour, and whether acute brain changes predict longer-term response.","Pretzsch Charlotte Marie, Freyberg Jan, Voinescu Bogdan, Lythgoe David, Horder Jamie, Mendez Maria Andreina, Wichers Robert, Ajram Laura, Ivin Glynis, Heasman Martin, Edden Richard A E, Williams Steven, Murphy Declan G M, Daly Eileen, McAlonan Gráinne M","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Basal Ganglia, Cannabidiol, Double-Blind Method, Glutamic Acid, Gray Matter, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Prefrontal Cortex, White Matter, Young Adult, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30758329","Department of Neuroimaging Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; Russel H Morgan Department of Radiology and Radiological Science, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust Pharmacy, London, UK.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK. grainne.mcalonan@kcl.ac.uk.",

Children assigned to the ESDM intervention received 3 months of weekly parent coaching followed by 24 months of 15 hour per week (on average) 1:1 treatment weekly on average in homes or daycare settings from supervised therapy assistants while parents received coaching 4 hours monthly from a certified ESDM therapist. For the primary analyses, there were time-by-group and time-by-group-by-site interactions for language outcome. In the significant 3-way interaction involving site, 2 sites showed a significant ESDM advantage and the third site showed no significant group differences. In the planned 2-way analysis that pooled data across all 3 sites, there was a significant advantage found for the ESDM group. For the secondary analyses, there were no significant differences between the ESDM and community groups involving developmental quotient, autism severity, or adaptive behavior. The treatment effect of group on language outcomes was not moderated by baseline developmental quotient, autism severity, or language. Results of the primary analysis provide a partial replication of Dawson et al.'s 2010 language findings.

Pivotal response treatment (PRT) is an effective intervention for targeting these skills; however, similar to other behavioral interventions, response to PRT is variable across individuals. Thus, objective markers capable of predicting treatment response are critically-needed to identify which children are most likely to benefit from this intervention. In this pilot study, we investigated whether structural neuroimaging measures from language regions in the brain are associated with response to PRT. Children with ASD (n = 18) who were receiving PRT to target their language deficits were assessed with MRI at baseline. T1-weighted images were segmented with FreeSurfer and morphometric measures of the primary language regions (inferior frontal (IFG) and superior temporal (STG) gyri) were evaluated. Children with ASD and language deficits did not exhibit the anticipated relationships between baseline structural measures of language regions and baseline language abilities, as assessed by the number of utterances displayed during a structured laboratory observation (SLO). Interestingly, the level of improvement on the SLO was correlated with baseline asymmetry of the IFG, and the size of the left STG at baseline was correlated with the level of improvement on standardized parental questionnaires. Although very preliminary, the observed associations between baseline structural properties of language regions and improvement in language abilities following PRT suggest that neuroimaging measures may be able to help identify which children are most likely to benefit from specific language treatments, which could help improve precision medicine for children with ASD.","Hegarty John P, Gengoux Grace W, Berquist Kari L, Millán M Estefanía, Tamura Serena M, Karve Shweta, Rosenthal Margaret D, Phillips Jennifer M, Hardan Antonio Y","Journal of psychiatric research","Autism Spectrum Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Child, Child, Preschool, Female, Humans, Language Disorders, Language Therapy, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Neuroimaging, Outcome Assessment, Health Care, Pilot Projects, Prefrontal Cortex, Temporal Lobe","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30771619","Department of Human Biology, Stanford University, 450 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.

Furthermore, the prevalence of epilepsy has been estimated to be 46% of patients with low intelligence quotient. It is important to investigate the therapeutic benefits and adverse effects of any recently developed drugs for this proportion of individuals with the so-called Kanner type of ASD. Therefore, we investigated the therapeutic and/or adverse effects of intranasal oxytocin (OT) administration, especially in adolescents and adults with ASD and comorbid intellectual disability and epilepsy, with regard to core symptoms of social deficits. We have already reported three randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs). However, we revisit results in our pilot studies from the view of comorbidity. Most of the intellectually disabled participants were found to be feasible participants of the RCT. We observed significantly more events regarded as reciprocal social interaction in the OT group compared with the placebo group. In the trial, no or little differences in adverse events were found between the OT and placebo arms, as found in some other reports. However, seizures were induced in three participants with medical history of epilepsy during or after OT treatment. In conclusion, we stress that behavioral changes in ASD patients with intellectual disabilities could be recognized not by the conventional measurements of ASD symptoms but by detailed evaluation of social interactions arising in daily-life situations.","Higashida Haruhiro, Munesue Toshio, Kosaka Hirotaka, Yamasue Hidenori, Yokoyama Shigeru, Kikuchi Mitsuru","Diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813294","Research Center for Child Mental Development, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa 920-8640, Japan. mitsuruk@med.kanazawa-u.ac.jp.; Department of Psychiatry and Research Center for Child Mental Development, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu 431-3192, Japan. yamasue-tky@umin.ac.jp.; Research Center for Child Mental Development, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa 920-8640, Japan. shigeruy@med.kanazawa-u.ac.jp.; Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medical Sciences and Research Center for Child Mental Development, University of Fukui, Eiheiji 910-1193, Japan. hirotaka@u-fukui.ac.jp.; Research Center for Child Mental Development, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa 920-8640, Japan. haruhiro@med.kanazawa-u.ac.jp.; Research Center for Child Mental Development, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa 920-8640, Japan. munesue@med.kanazawa-u.ac.jp.",

The current study investigated the use of eye tracking as a biomarker of treatment response in the context of a pilot randomized clinical trial of treatment for young children with ASD. Participants included 28 children with ASD, aged 18-48 months, who were randomized to one of two conditions: Pivotal Response Intervention for Social Motivation (PRISM) or community treatment as usual (TAU). Eye-tracking and behavioral assessment of developmental functioning were administered at Time 1 (prior to randomization) and at Time 2 (after 6 months of intervention). Two well-established eye-tracking paradigms were used to measure social attention: social preference and face scanning. As a context for understanding relationships between social attention and developmental ability, we first examined how scanning patterns at Time 1 were associated with concurrent developmental functioning and compared to those of 23 age-matched typically developing (TD) children. Changes in scanning patterns from Time 1 to Time 2 were then compared between PRISM and TAU groups and associated with behavioral change over time. Results showed that the social preference paradigm differentiated children with ASD from TD children. In addition, attention during face scanning was associated with language and adaptive communication skills at Time 1 and change in language skills from Time 1 to Time 2. These findings highlight the importance of examining targeted biomarkers that measure unique aspects of child functioning and that are well-matched to proposed mechanisms of change.

LAY SUMMARY: Biomarkers have the potential to provide important information about how and why early interventions effect positive change for young children with ASD. The current study suggests that eye-tracking measures of social attention can be used to track change in specific areas of development, such as language, and points to the need for targeted eye-tracking paradigms designed to measure specific behavioral changes. Such biomarkers could inform the development of optimal, individualized, and adaptive interventions for young children with ASD.","Bradshaw Jessica, Shic Frederick, Holden Anahita N, Horowitz Erin J, Barrett Amy C, German Tamsin C, Vernon Ty W","Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research","Attention, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Biomarkers, Child, Preschool, Early Intervention, Educational, Eye Movements, Female, Humans, Infant, Male, Motivation, Pilot Projects, Social Behavior, Treatment Outcome","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30891960","Department of Psychology, University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina.; Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, University of California Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California.; Department of Counseling, Clinical, and School Psychology, University of California Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California.; Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development, Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, Washington.",

While mobile technology-based therapy can alleviate wait-lists and scale for increasing demand, few clinical trials exist to support its use for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) care. To evaluate the efficacy of Superpower Glass, an artificial intelligence-driven wearable behavioral intervention for improving social outcomes of children with ASD. A randomized clinical trial in which participants received the Superpower Glass intervention plus standard of care applied behavioral analysis therapy and control participants received only applied behavioral analysis therapy. Assessments were completed at the Stanford University Medical School, and enrolled participants used the Superpower Glass intervention in their homes. Children aged 6 to 12 years with a formal ASD diagnosis who were currently receiving applied behavioral analysis therapy were included. Families were recruited between June 2016 and December 2017. The first participant was enrolled on November 1, 2016, and the last appointment was completed on April 11, 2018. Data analysis was conducted between April and October 2018. The Superpower Glass intervention, deployed via Google Glass (worn by the child) and a smartphone app, promotes facial engagement and emotion recognition by detecting facial expressions and providing reinforcing social cues. Families were asked to conduct 20-minute sessions at home 4 times per week for 6 weeks. Four socialization measures were assessed using an intention-to-treat analysis with a Bonferroni test correction. Overall, 71 children (63 boys [89%]; mean [SD] age, 8.38 [2.46] years) diagnosed with ASD were enrolled (40 [56.3%] were randomized to treatment, and 31 (43.7%) were randomized to control). Children receiving the intervention showed significant improvements on the Vineland Adaptive Behaviors Scale socialization subscale compared with treatment as usual controls (mean [SD] treatment impact, 4.58 [1.62]; P = .005). Positive mean treatment effects were also found for the other 3 primary measures but not to a significance threshold of P = .0125. The observed 4.58-point average gain on the Vineland Adaptive Behaviors Scale socialization subscale is comparable with gains observed with standard of care therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized clinical trial to demonstrate efficacy of a wearable digital intervention to improve social behavior of children with ASD. The intervention reinforces facial engagement and emotion recognition, suggesting either or both could be a mechanism of action driving the observed improvement. This study underscores the potential of digital home therapy to augment the standard of care.

Here, we aimed to replicate this finding and investigate the effects of oxytocin on empathic accuracy in women. To date, women have been seriously underrepresented in human oxytocin research, and it is not known whether the effects observed in male-only samples apply to women. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, we administered 24 IU intranasal oxytocin (and, on a separate occasion, a matching placebo) to 31 men and 40 women and then measured empathic accuracy. AQ was assessed at baseline (prior to drug administration). Replicating a 2010 study by Bartz et al., oxytocin selectively improved empathic accuracy for men who scored higher on the AQ, whereas oxytocin did not benefit their lower AQ counterparts. Conversely, we found no effect of oxytocin on empathic accuracy for women (regardless of their AQ score). In addition to speaking to reliability, this research is important given interest in using oxytocin to augment social functioning in some psychiatric disorders marked by social cognitive impairments.

Baclofen, which functions as a selective agonist for GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, does appear promising for the treatment of ASD. We conducted a 10-week randomized-controlled study aimed at evaluating the potential of baclofen as an adjuvant therapy to enhance the effect of risperidone in children with ASD. Sixty-four children (3-12 years) with moderate-to-severe irritability symptoms of ASD were included. We used the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Edition (ABC-C) for the outcome measures on each of the follow-up visits (weeks 0, 5, and 10). Analysis of the combined data revealed significant improvement for all the ABC subscales (irritability: F = 51.644, df = 1.66, p < 0.001, lethargy: F = 39.734, df = 1.38, p < 0.001, stereotypic behavior: F = 25.495, df = 1.56, p < 0.001, hyperactivity: F = 54.135, df = 1.35, p < 0.001, and inappropriate speech: F = 19.277, df = 1.47, p = 0.004).

One important resource in managing these heightened levels of negative affect is emotion regulation, which in turn depends upon the ability to recognize and understand one's own and others' mental states (referred to as mentalization or reflective functioning). In this study, parents of children with ASD either participated in a mentalization-based group intervention (N = 36) or a delayed treatment (N = 28). Compared to delayed treatment participants, parents in the mentalization-based group had increases in reflective functioning and in the belief that emotions can change. Moreover, they reported decreased behavioral and emotional symptoms in their children, and greater parental self-efficacy. These preliminary findings support previous studies, which have shown that mentalization-based interventions for parents lead to positive outcomes, and suggest that these findings may apply to a diverse population of parents such as those of children with broader autism phenotype or children with different neurological disorders. Further studies to evaluate the effects of the intervention are recommended. Autism Res 2019, 12: 1077-1086. © 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

MDMA increases social behavior in animal models and has shown promise in psychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). How it produces these prosocial effects is not known. This behavioral and psychophysiological study examined the effects of MDMA, compared with the prototypical stimulant methamphetamine (MA), on two measures of social behavior in healthy young adults: (i) responses to socially relevant, ""affective"" touch, and (ii) visual attention to emotional faces. Men and women (N = 36) attended four sessions in which they received MDMA (0.75 or 1.5 mg/kg), MA (20 mg), or a placebo in randomized order under double-blind conditions. Responses to experienced and observed affective touch (i.e., being touched or watching others being touched) were assessed using facial electromyography (EMG), a proxy of affective state. Responses to emotional faces were assessed using electrooculography (EOG) in a measure of attentional bias. Subjective ratings were also included. We hypothesized that MDMA, but not MA, would enhance the ratings of pleasantness and psychophysiological responses to affective touch and increase attentional bias toward positive facial expressions. Consistent with this, we found that MDMA, but not MA, selectively enhanced ratings of pleasantness of experienced affective touch. Neither drug altered the ratings of pleasantness of observed touch. On the EOG measure of attentional bias, MDMA, but not MA, increased attention toward happy faces. These results provide new evidence that MDMA can enhance the experience of positive social interactions; in this case, pleasantness of physical touch and attentional bias toward positive facial expressions. The findings are consistent with evidence that the prosocial effects are unique to MDMA relative to another stimulant. Understanding the behavioral and neurobiological processes underlying the distinctive social effects of MDMA is a key step to developing the drug for psychiatric disorders.","Bershad Anya K, Mayo Leah M, Van Hedger Kathryne, McGlone Francis, Walker Susannah C, de Wit Harriet","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Adolescent, Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors, Adult, Affect, Attention, Attentional Bias, Cues, Double-Blind Method, Electromyography, Electrooculography, Facial Muscles, Female, Healthy Volunteers, Humans, Male, Methamphetamine, N-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, Pleasure, Social Behavior, Touch Perception, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042696","Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.; School of Natural Sciences and Psychology, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, UK.; Center for Social and Affective Neuroscience, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden.; Department of Clinical Neurological Sciences, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, UK.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA. hdew@uchicago.edu.",

This randomized double-blind parallel-group study was conducted in three academic medical centers and a single private pediatric practice. Eighty children or adolescents (aged 6-17 yrs) with autistic disorder were enrolled, and 61 patients were randomized to the study drug. Of those patients, 51 completed the 10-week trial, and 31 completed an optional 12-week blinded extension phase. All patients were treated with 2 weeks of placebo before random assignment to receive aripiprazole (31 patients) or risperidone (30 patients) for 10 weeks. Sixteen placebo responders (20%) were excluded from further analysis. Drug dosing followed U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling, and weekly dosage adjustments were allowed until week 4; patients were then maintained on a fixed dose for 6 additional weeks. Safety, physical, and psychological assessments were recorded weekly or every 2 weeks. No significant differences in severity of illness between the aripiprazole and risperidone groups were noted at baseline. All patients significantly improved on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability subscale after 1 week and continued for the remaining 9 weeks and the extension phase. Improvement was greatest in the risperidone group at every assessment period and was statistically significantly better than that in the aripiprazole group at weeks 3 and 6 (p<0.05). No dose-limiting adverse events occurred during the dose-titration period.

However, repeatable, objective, and quantitative measurement of autism spectrum disorder's core symptoms are lacking, making it difficult to examine potential time-course changes in efficacy. We tested this hypothesis using repeatable, objective, and quantitative measurement of the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. We examined videos recorded during semi-structured social interaction administered as the primary outcome in single-site exploratory (n = 18, crossover within-subjects design) and multisite confirmatory (n = 106, parallel-group design), double-blind, placebo-controlled 6-week trials of repeated intranasal administrations of oxytocin (48 IU/day) in adult males with autism spectrum disorder. The main outcomes were statistical representative values of objectively quantified facial expression intensity in a repeatable part of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule: the maximum probability (i.e. mode) and the natural logarithm of mode on the probability density function of neutral facial expression and the natural logarithm of mode on the probability density function of happy expression. Our recent study revealed that increases in these indices characterize autistic facial expression, compared with neurotypical individuals. The current results revealed that oxytocin consistently and significantly decreased the increased natural logarithm of mode on the probability density function of neutral facial expression compared with placebo in exploratory (effect-size, -0.57; 95% CI, -1.27 to 0.13; P = 0.023) and confirmatory trials (-0.41; -0.62 to -0.20; P < 0.001). A significant interaction between time-course (at baseline, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks) and the efficacy of oxytocin on the natural logarithm of mode on the probability density function of neutral facial expression was found in confirmatory trial (P < 0.001). Post hoc analyses revealed maximum efficacy at 2 weeks (P < 0.001, Cohen's d = -0.78; 95% CI, -1.21 to -0.35) and deterioration of efficacy at 4 weeks (P = 0.042, Cohen's d = -0.46; 95% CI, -0.90 to -0.01) and 6 weeks (P = 0.10, Cohen's d = -0.35; 95% CI, -0.77 to 0.08), while efficacy was preserved at 2 weeks post-treatment (i.e. 8 weeks) (P < 0.001, Cohen's d = -1.24; 95% CI, -1.71 to -0.78). Quantitative facial expression analyses successfully verified the positive effects of repeated oxytocin on autistic individuals' facial expressions and demonstrated a time-course change in efficacy. The current findings support further development of an optimized regimen of oxytocin treatment.","Owada Keiho, Okada Takashi, Munesue Toshio, Kuroda Miho, Fujioka Toru, Uno Yota, Matsumoto Kaori, Kuwabara Hitoshi, Mori Daisuke, Okamoto Yuko, Yoshimura Yuko, Kawakubo Yuki, Arioka Yuko, Kojima Masaki, Yuhi Teruko, Yassin Walid, Kushima Itaru, Benner Seico, Ogawa Nanayo, Kawano Naoko, Eriguchi Yosuke, Uemura Yukari, Yamamoto Maeri, Kano Yukiko, Kasai Kiyoto, Higashida Haruhiro, Ozaki Norio, Kosaka Hirotaka, Yamasue Hidenori","Brain : a journal of neurology","Administration, Intranasal, Adolescent, Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Facial Expression, Humans, Interpersonal Relations, Male, Middle Aged, Oxytocin, Time Factors, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096266","Biostatistics Division, Clinical Research Support Center, University of Tokyo Hospital, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Child Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Psychiatry, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, 65 Tsurumai-cho, Showa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.; Graduate School of Psychology, Kanazawa Institute of Technology, 7-1 Ohgigaoka, Nonoichi, Japan.; Department of Psychiatry, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashiku, Hamamatsu City, Japan.; Research Center for Child Mental Development, University of Fukui, Eiheiji, Fukui, Japan.; Research Center for Child Mental Development, Kanazawa University, 13-1 Takara-machi, Kanazawa, Japan.",

Its dysfunction is associated with a number of psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, autism, depression, substance use disorder (SUD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and anxiety disorders. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) studies targeting the mPFC indicate that it may be a useful therapeutic resource in psychiatry due to its selective modulation of this area and connected regions. This review examines six mPFC rTMS trials selected from 697 initial search results. We discuss the main results, technical and methodological details, safety, tolerability, and localization strategies. Six different protocols were identified, including inhibitory (1 Hz) and excitatory (5, 10, and 20 Hz) frequencies applied therapeutically to patient populations diagnosed with major depressive disorder, OCD, autistic spectrum disorder, SUD, specific phobia, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In the OCD and acrophobia trials, rTMS significantly reduced symptoms compared to placebo. These protocols were considered safe and add interesting new evidence to the growing body of mPFC rTMS literature. However, the small number and low methodological quality of the studies indicate the need for further research.","Marques Rodrigo C, Vieira Larissa, Marques Déborah, Cantilino Amaury","Revista brasileira de psiquiatria (Sao Paulo, Brazil : 1999)","Humans, Mental Disorders, Prefrontal Cortex, Reproducibility of Results, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Treatment Outcome","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31166547","Programa de Pós-Graduação em Neuropsiquiatria e Ciências do Comportamento, UFPE, Recife, PE, Brazil.; Departamento de Neuropsiquiatria, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, PE, Brazil.",

Previous studies have found that genetic variation predicts response to metformin in diabetes. In this study, we aimed to assess whether response to metformin for weight gain in this population is associated with variants in five genes previously implicated in metformin response in diabetes. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Youth with ASD who experienced significant weight gain while taking mixed receptor antagonist medications were randomly assigned to metformin or placebo for 16 weeks, followed by open-label metformin treatment for 16 weeks. In the 53 participants with available DNA samples, we used a linear, mixed model analysis to assess response in the first 16 weeks of metformin treatment, whether in the randomized or open-label period, based upon genotypes at polymorphisms in five genes previously associated with metformin response in diabetes: <i>ATM</i>, <i>SLC2A2</i>, <i>MATE1</i>, <i>MATE2</i>, and <i>OCT1</i>. <b><i>Results:</i></b> In the primary analysis, both <i>ATM</i> and <i>OCT1</i> showed significant effects of genotype on change in body mass index <i>z</i>-scores, the primary outcome measure, during the first 16 weeks of treatment with metformin.

The children, aged 2 to 6 years old, were suspected to have autism spectrum disorder (ASD) based on Pervasive Developmental Disorders Autism Society Japan Rating Scale (PARS) scores of 9 points or more. The investigation randomly assigned them to two groups-""the intervention group"" and ""the control group""-and carried out SSTP. The intervention group answered the questionnaire before and after intervention, three months later. The control group also answered the questionnaire 2 months before the intervention, before and after intervention. Thus, each group answered three times. The questionnaire used the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), a Parenting Style scale (PS), the Relationship Quality Index (RQI), and the Japanese version of a Maltreatment scale (JM). For effectiveness of the intervention before and after, an analysis of covariance was carried out on the scores from the first and second questionnaires in the intervention and control groups. For effectiveness 3 months after the intervention, a repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed on the scale scores from the first to the third questionnaire in the intervention group.Results　The average age of the children was 3.7±1.4 years old, and the average PARS score was 20±6.8. They were suspected to have ASD. The average SDQ score was 76.1±18.8, and their intelligence was borderline. A significant difference was seen before and after the intervention in SDQ (the issue of action, the total of the difficulty), PS (overreaction, gab, general score), and JM scores; no significant difference was seen in RQI scores. Three months after the intervention, a lasting effect was seen in SDQ (the issue of action, the total of the difficulty, hyperkinetic) and PS (all items) scores in the intervention group.Conclusions　Receiving SSTP caused a positive change in the mothers' parenting and improved the problem behavior of the children.

In the current double-blind placebo (PLC) controlled between-subject design study we therefore recruited 71 male subjects (OXT = 34, PLC = 37) to investigate the effects of intranasal OXT (24IU) on both bottom-up attention allocation and top-down attention inhibition using a prosaccade and antisaccade paradigm incorporating social (neutral, happy, fearful, sad, angry faces) and non-social (oval shape) visual stimuli with concurrent eye movement acquisition. Results revealed a marginal significant interaction effect between treatment, condition and task (p = 0.054), with Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests indicating that OXT specifically increased antisaccade errors for social stimuli (ps < 0.04, effect sizes 0.46-0.88), but not non-social stimuli. Antisaccades are under volitional control and therefore this may indicate that OXT treatment reduced top-down inhibition. However, the overall findings are consistent with OXT acting to reduce top-down control of attention as a result of increasing bottom-up early attentional processing of social, but not non-social, stimuli in situations where the two systems are in potential conflict. Marked deficits in bottom-up attention allocation to social stimuli have been reported in autism spectrum disorder, within this context OXT may have the potential to increase early attention allocation towards social cues.","Xu Xiaolei, Li Jialin, Chen Zhuo, Kendrick Keith M, Becker Benjamin","Psychoneuroendocrinology","Administration, Intranasal, Adolescent, Adult, Attention, Double-Blind Method, Emotions, Eye Movements, Facial Expression, Healthy Volunteers, Humans, Male, Oxytocin, Reaction Time, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31229634","The Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, MOE Key Laboratory for NeuroInformation, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, 610054, China.

However, the neural action of CBD, and its relevance to ASD, remains unclear. We and others have previously shown that response to drug challenge can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), but that pharmacological responsivity is atypical in ASD. We hypothesized that there would be a (different) fMRI response to CBD in ASD. To test this, task-free fMRI was acquired in 34 healthy men (half with ASD) following oral administration of 600 mg CBD or matched placebo (random order; double-blind administration). The 'fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations' (fALFF) was measured across the whole brain, and, where CBD significantly altered fALFF, we tested if functional connectivity (FC) of those regions was also affected by CBD. CBD significantly increased fALFF in the cerebellar vermis and the right fusiform gyrus. However, post-hoc within-group analyses revealed that this effect was primarily driven by the ASD group, with no significant change in controls. Within the ASD group only, CBD also significantly altered vermal FC with several of its subcortical (striatal) and cortical targets, but did not affect fusiform FC with other regions in either group. Our results suggest that, especially in ASD, CBD alters regional fALFF and FC in/between regions consistently implicated in ASD.

We hypothesized that tDCS could improve the EF of HF-ASD patients. Such enhancement could improve their adaptive behaviors. Eight patients with HF-ASD received 10 consecutive cathodal tDCS sessions (2 mA) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (F3) for 15 min each in an open trial. EF (with the Stroop test, Trail Making Test [TMT] A and B, Modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test [mWCST], and Verbal Fluency Test) and behavioral dysexecutive syndrome (with the Behavioral Dysexecutive Syndrome Inventory and the Repetitive and Restricted Behaviour scale) were assessed before and 10 days after treatment.

Regarding behavior, the hypoactivity of the patients improved, as well as their repetitive and restrictive behaviors. In addition, this noninvasive neurostimulation technique was well tolerated. Flexibility and initiation are the most impaired EF in autism. These are promising results which justify a randomized and placebo-controlled study in a wider population. If these results were confirmed by a randomized controlled trial, tDCS could be an easy and well-tolerated adjunctive treatment aiming to improve the quality of life and the autonomy of ASD patients.","Rothärmel Maud, Moulier Virginie, Vasse Marianne, Isaac Clémence, Faerber Mathieu, Bendib Bilal, Mirea-Grivel Iris, Opolczynski Gaëlle, Rosier Antoine, Guillin Olivier","Neuropsychobiology","Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Executive Function, Female, Humans, Male, Neuropsychological Tests, Pilot Projects, Prefrontal Cortex, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31266030","University Department of Psychiatry, Centre Hospitalier du Rouvray, Sotteville-lès-Rouen, France.; Centre Ressource Autisme Normandie Seine Eure, Centre Hospitalier du Rouvray, Sotteville-lès-Rouen, France.; University Department of Psychiatry, Centre Hospitalier du Rouvray, Sotteville-lès-Rouen, France, maud.rotharmel@ch-lerouvray.fr.; EPS Ville Evrard, Unité de Recherche Clinique, Neuilly-sur-Marne, France.",

SSGT has shown modest and heterogeneous effects. One of the major genetic risk factors in ASD is rare copy number variation (CNV). However, limited information exists whether CNV profiles could be used to aid intervention decisions. Here, we analyzed the rare genic CNV carrier status for 207 children, of which 105 received SSGT and 102 standard care as part of a randomized clinical trial for SSGT. We found that being a carrier of rare genic CNV did not have an impact on the SSGT outcome measured by the parent-report Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS). However, when stratifying by pathogenicity and size of the CNVs, we identified that carriers of clinically significant and large genic CNVs (>500 kb) showed inferior SRS outcomes at post-intervention (P = 0.047 and P = 0.036, respectively) and follow-up (P = 0.008 and P = 0.072, respectively) when adjusting for standard care effects. Our study provides preliminary evidence that carriers of clinically significant and large genic CNVs might not benefit as much from SSGT as non-carriers.

Method A randomized delayed treatment control group design with pre- and postintervention assessments of both parents and children was implemented within a community practice setting. Two follow-up assessments at 3 and 6 months postintervention were also completed. Results Overall, results indicate that the intervention is efficacious in teaching social communication and self-regulation concept knowledge to children with ASD and their parents. Both parents and children demonstrated an increase in social communication and self-regulation knowledge after participating in the Growing, Learning, and Living With Autism Group as compared to a delayed treatment control group. The effects of the intervention did not extend to parent-child interactions coded from video recordings. Child treatment effects were maintained at the 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments. Conclusions Preliminary efficacy of the Growing, Learning, and Living With Autism Group was established.

Behavioral, educational, and pharmaceutical interventions have been shown to reduce behavioral disabilities, improve verbal/non-verbal communication, and help patients acquire self-reliance skills. However, there has been a lack of systematic verification and consensus regarding the treatment of the core symptoms of ASD because of its unclear etiology. Ukgansangajinpibanha (UGSJB), a legitimately prescribed herbal medicine for nervousness, insomnia, night crying, and malnutrition in South Korea and Japan, has been used for angry, sensitive, nervous, and unsettled children with ASD. This trial is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, clinical trial. The 4- to 6-year-old children with ASD will be randomly assigned to following groups: 1. A UGSJB granule with acupuncture, twice daily (n = 120) 2. A placebo group with acupuncture, twice daily (n = 120). The following outcome measures will be used: behavior by the Childhood Autism Rating Scale, Autism Behavior Checklist, and Aberrant Behavior Checklist; social maturity by the Social Maturity Scale; quality of life by the Child Health Questionnaire and EuroQoL Five-dimension Five-level Youth; and parental stress by the Parenting Stress Index at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 weeks after the beginning of treatment. In addition, to evaluate safety, we will investigate the adverse reactions that may be caused by UGSJB granule. Finally, we will make an economic evaluation of UGSJB for the treatment of ASD. We prepared a well-designed clinical trial to investigate the safety and effectiveness of UGSJB on ASD symptoms compared with placebo treatment.

During rivalry, perception alternates between the two eyes, and the ebb and flow of perception is modeled to rely on the strength of inhibitory interactions between competitive neuronal populations in visual cortex. As a result, rivalry has been suggested as a noninvasive perceptual marker of inhibitory signaling in visual cortex, and its putative disturbance in psychiatric conditions, including autism. Yet, direct evidence causally implicating inhibitory signaling in the dynamics of binocular rivalry is currently lacking. We previously found that people with higher GABA levels in visual cortex, measured using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, have stronger perceptual suppression during rivalry. Here, we present direct causal tests of the impact of GABAergic inhibition on rivalry dynamics, and the contribution of specific GABA receptors to these dynamics. In a crossover pharmacological design with male and female adult participants, we found that drugs that modulate the two dominant GABA receptor types in the brain, GABA<sub>A</sub> (clobazam) and GABA<sub>B</sub> (arbaclofen), increase perceptual suppression during rivalry relative to a placebo. Crucially, these results could not be explained by changes in reaction times or response criteria, as determined through rivalry simulation trials, suggesting a direct and specific influence of GABA on perceptual suppression. A full replication study of the GABA<sub>B</sub> modulator reinforces these findings. These results provide causal evidence for a link between the strength of inhibition in the brain and perceptual suppression during rivalry and have implications for psychiatric conditions including autism.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How does the brain accomplish perceptual gating? Here we use a direct and causal pharmacological manipulation to present insight into the neural machinery of a classic illusion of perceptual awareness: binocular rivalry. We show that drugs that increase GABAergic inhibition in the brain, clobazam (GABA<sub>A</sub> modulator) and arbaclofen (GABA<sub>B</sub> modulator), increase perceptual suppression during rivalry relative to a placebo. These results present the first causal link between GABAergic inhibition and binocular rivalry in humans, complementing classic models of binocular rivalry, and have implications for our understanding of psychiatric conditions, such as autism, where binocular rivalry is posited as a behavioral marker of disruptions in inhibitory signaling in the brain.","Mentch Jeff, Spiegel Alina, Ricciardi Catherine, Robertson Caroline E","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","Adolescent, Adult, Awareness, Baclofen, Clobazam, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Female, GABA-A Receptor Agonists, GABA-B Receptor Agonists, Humans, Male, Vision, Binocular, Visual Perception, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31451579","School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, 21205, and.; Clinical Research Center, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139.; Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755, caroline.e.robertson@dartmouth.edu.; Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755.",

Currently, no technologies directly target these core social attention difficulties. This study examines the feasibility of automated gaze modification training for improving attention to faces in 3-year-olds with ASD. Using free-viewing data from typically developing (TD) controls (n = 41), we implemented gaze-contingent adaptive cueing to redirect children with ASD toward normative looking patterns during viewing of videos of an actress. Children with ASD were randomly assigned to either (a) an adaptive Cue condition (Cue, n = 16) or (b) a No-Cue condition (No-Cue, n = 19). Performance was examined at baseline, during training, and post-training, and contrasted with TD controls (n = 23). Proportion of time looking at the screen (%Screen) and at actresses' faces (%Face) was analyzed. At Pre-Training, Cue and No-Cue groups did not differ in %Face (P > 0.1). At Post-Training, the Cue group had higher %Face than the No-Cue group (P = 0.015). In the No-Cue group %Face decreased Pre- to Post-Training; no decline was observed in the Cue group. These results suggest gaze-contingent training effectively mitigated decreases of attention toward the face of onscreen social characters in ASD. Additionally, larger training effects were observed in children with lower nonverbal ability, suggesting a gaze-contingent approach may be particularly relevant for children with greater cognitive impairment.

This study employs two discrete samples (one lab-based, one community-based) of youth with ASD to examine the effects of performance-based interventions on social knowledge.

Cognitive behavioral treatment for childhood insomnia (CBT-CI) is efficacious in typically developing children, but not yet tested in school-aged children with autism. This single arm pilot tested 8-session CBT-CI in 17 children with autism and insomnia (M age = 8.76 years, SD = 1.99) and their parent(s) (M age = 39.50 years, SD = 4.83). Treatment integrity was assessed for each session [delivery (by therapist), receipt (participant understanding), and enactment (home practice)]. Children and parents wore actigraphs and completed electronic diaries for 2-weeks to obtain objective and subjective sleep onset latency (SOL), total sleep/wake times (TST/TWT), and sleep efficiency (SE) at pre/post/1-month follow-up. Parents also completed the Aberrant Behavior Checklist [irritability, lethargy, stereotypy, hyperactivity, inappropriate speech (e.g., excessive/repetitive, loud self-talk)] at pre/post/1-month. Fifteen children completed all sessions. Average integrity scores were high [90%-delivery/receipt, 87.5%-enactment]. Parents found CBT-CI helpful, age-appropriate, and autism-friendly. Paired samples t-tests (family-wise error controlled) found CBT-CI improved child sleep (objective SOL-18 min, TWT- 34 min, SE-5%; subjective SOL-29 min, TST-63 min, TWT-45 min, SE-8%), and decreased irritability, lethargy, stereotypy, and hyperactivity. At 1-month, objective TST improved, inappropriate speech decreased, but hyperactivity was no longer decreased. Other gains were maintained. Parent sleep (objective SOL-12 min, TST-35 min, TWT-21 min, SE-4%; subjective SOL-11 min, TWT- 31min, SE-11%) and fatigue also improved. At 1-month, gains were maintained.

Participants aged 7.5-18 years with autism spectrum disorders and a total score of 6 or higher on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, modified for pervasive developmental disorder (CYBOCS-PDD) were recruited from 3 tertiary health centers across Australia. Enrollment began November 2010 and ended April 2017. Follow-up ended August 2017. Participants were randomized to receive fluoxetine (n = 75) or placebo (n = 71). Study medication was commenced at 4 or 8 mg/d for the first week, depending on weight, and then titrated to a maximum dose of 20 or 30 mg/d over 4 weeks. Treatment duration was 16 weeks. The primary outcome was the total score on the CYBOCS-PDD (scores range from 0-20; higher scores indicate higher levels of maladaptive behaviors; minimal clinically important difference, 2 points) at 16 weeks postrandomization, analyzed with a linear regression model adjusted for stratification factors (site, age at baseline, and intellectual disability), with an additional prespecified model that included additional adjustment for baseline score, sex, communication level, and imbalanced baseline and demographic variables. Among the 146 participants who were randomized (85% males; mean age, 11.2 years), 109 completed the trial; 31 in the fluoxetine group and 21 in the placebo group dropped out or did not complete treatment. The mean CYBOCS-PDD score from baseline to 16 weeks decreased in the fluoxetine group from 12.80 to 9.02 points (3.72-point decrease; 95% CI, -4.85 to -2.60) and in the placebo group from 13.13 to 10.89 points (2.53-point decrease; 95% CI, -3.86 to -1.19).

Hence, we investigated the role of the SSRI citalopram on EF networks in 19 right-handed adult males with ASD and 19 controls who did not differ in gender, age, IQ or handedness. We performed pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare brain activity during two EF tasks (of response inhibition and sustained attention) after an acute dose of 20 mg citalopram or placebo using a randomised, double-blind, crossover design. Under placebo condition, individuals with ASD had abnormal brain activation in response inhibition regions, including inferior frontal, precentral and postcentral cortices and cerebellum. During sustained attention, individuals with ASD had abnormal brain activation in middle temporal cortex and (pre)cuneus. After citalopram administration, abnormal brain activation in inferior frontal cortex was 'normalised' and most of the other brain functional differences were 'abolished'. Also, within ASD, the degree of responsivity in inferior frontal and postcentral cortices to SSRI challenge was related to plasma serotonin levels. These findings suggest that citalopram can 'normalise' atypical brain activation during EF in ASD. Future trials should investigate whether this shift in the biology of ASD is maintained after prolonged citalopram treatment, and if peripheral measures of serotonin predict treatment response.","Wichers Robert H, Findon James L, Jelsma Auke, Giampietro Vincent, Stoencheva Vladimira, Robertson Dene M, Murphy Clodagh M, McAlonan Grainne, Ecker Christine, Rubia Katya, Murphy Declan G M, Daly Eileen M","Translational psychiatry","Adult, Attention, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Brain, Brain Mapping, Citalopram, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Executive Function, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, Visual Analog Scale, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31712584","Department of Neuroimaging, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, The Sackler Centre for Translational Neurodevelopment, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK. rob.wichers@kcl.ac.uk.; Behavioural and Developmental Psychiatry Clinical Academic Group, South London and Maudsley NHS Trust, London, UK.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, The Sackler Centre for Translational Neurodevelopment, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; Department of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy, University Hospital Frankfurt am Main, Goethe-University Frankfurt am Main, Frankfurt, Germany.",

Among associated symptoms of ASD, management of irritability has gained considerable attention as it complicates adjustment of ASD patients and thus necessitates its pharmacological treatment. Resveratrol is a plant phytoalexin, which has been demonstrated to have neuroprotective effects through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial was designed to assess the potential therapeutic effects of resveratrol plus risperidone on irritability of ASD patients. Sixty-two patients were assigned randomly into two groups of resveratrol and placebo. Both groups were treated with risperidone twice daily starting at a dose of 0.5 mg with a dose increase of 0.5 mg per week (for the first 3 weeks). Resveratrol dosage was 250 mg twice per day from the beginning of the study. Using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C), patients were assessed for ASD-related behavioural symptoms at baseline, week 5 and week 10. The frequency of adverse events was recorded using a checklist containing 25 possible side effects, including general, gastrointestinal, neurological and cardiovascular complications. Improvements in primary outcome measure (irritability) and three secondary outcome measures (lethargy/social withdrawal, stereotypic behaviour and inappropriate speech subscales) in the resveratrol group were statistically similar to those in the placebo group. The repeated measures analysis showed no time × treatment interaction on these subscale scores. In contrast, patients in the resveratrol group showed greater decline in hyperactivity/non-compliance score as a secondary outcome measure (mean difference [CI = 95%] = 4.51 [0.10-8.92], t = 2.04; P = .04), and repeated measures analysis showed significant effect for time × treatment effect on this subscale score (F = 3.81; df = 1.30; P = .043). There was no significant difference in number and severity of adverse events between the two groups.

This has led some families and researchers to trial alternative remedies - including the non-intoxicating Cannabis sativa-derived compound cannabidivarin (CBDV). However, how CBDV affects the human brain is unknown. Previous (pre)clinical evidence suggests that CBDV may modulate brain excitatory-inhibitory systems, which are implicated in ASD. Hence, our main aim was to test, for the first time, if CBDV shifts glutamate and/or GABA metabolites - markers of the brain's primary excitatory and inhibitory system - in both the 'typical' and autistic brain. Our subsidiary aim was to determine whether, within ASD, brain responsivity to CBDV challenge is related to baseline biological phenotype. We tested this using a repeated-measures, double-blind, randomized-order, cross-over design. We used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to compare glutamate (Glx = glutamate + glutamine) and GABA + (GABA + macromolecules) levels following placebo (baseline) and 600 mg CBDV in 34 healthy men with (n = 17) and without (n = 17) ASD. Data acquisition from regions previously reliably linked to ASD (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, DMPFC; left basal ganglia, BG) commenced 2 h (peak plasma levels) after placebo/CBDV administration. Where CBDV significantly shifted metabolite levels, we examined the relationship of this change with baseline metabolite levels. Test sessions were at least 13 days apart to ensure CBDV wash-out. CBDV significantly increased Glx in the BG of both groups. However, this impact was not uniform across individuals. In the ASD group, and not in the typically developing controls, the 'shift' in Glx correlated negatively with baseline Glx concentration. In contrast, CBDV had no significant impact on Glx in the DMPFC, or on GABA+ in either voxel in either group. Our findings suggest that, as measured by MRS, CBDV modulates the glutamate-GABA system in the BG but not in frontal regions. Moreover, there is individual variation in response depending on baseline biochemistry. Future studies should examine the effect of CBDV on behaviour and if the response to an acute dose of CBDV could predict a potential clinical treatment response in ASD.","Pretzsch Charlotte M, Voinescu Bogdan, Lythgoe David, Horder Jamie, Mendez Maria Andreina, Wichers Robert, Ajram Laura, Ivin Glynis, Heasman Martin, Edden Richard A E, Williams Steven, Murphy Declan G M, Daly Eileen, McAlonan Gráinne M","Translational psychiatry","Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Basal Ganglia, Cannabinoids, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Female, Glutamic Acid, Gray Matter, Humans, Inhibition, Psychological, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Prefrontal Cortex, White Matter, Young Adult, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31748505","South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust Pharmacy, London, UK.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; Russel H Morgan Department of Radiology and Radiological Science, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK. grainne.mcalonan@kcl.ac.uk.; Department of Neuroimaging Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.",

Psychological therapies are commonly used to treat school-aged youth with ASD; their efficacy has not been established. To compare the relative efficacy of 2 cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) programs and treatment as usual (TAU) to assess treatment outcomes on maladaptive and interfering anxiety in children with ASD. The secondary objectives were to assess treatment outcomes on positive response, ASD symptom severity, and anxiety-associated adaptive functioning. This randomized clinical trial began recruitment in April 2014 at 3 universities in US cities. A volunteer sample of children (7-13 years) with ASD and maladaptive and interfering anxiety was randomized to standard-of-practice CBT, CBT adapted for ASD, or TAU. Independent evaluators were blinded to groupings. Data were collected through January 2017 and analyzed from December 2018 to February 2019. The main features of standard-of-practice CBT were affect recognition, reappraisal, modeling/rehearsal, in vivo exposure tasks, and reinforcement. The CBT intervention adapted for ASD was similar but also addressed social communication and self-regulation challenges with perspective-taking training and behavior-analytic techniques. The primary outcome measure per a priori hypotheses was the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale. Secondary outcomes included treatment response on the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale and checklist measures. Of 214 children initially enrolled, 167 were randomized, 145 completed treatment, and 22 discontinued participation. Those who were not randomized failed to meet eligibility criteria (eg, confirmed ASD). There was no significant difference in discontinuation rates across conditions. Randomized children had a mean (SD) age of 9.9 (1.8) years; 34 were female (20.5%). The CBT program adapted for ASD outperformed standard-of-practice CBT (mean [SD] Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale score, 2.13 [0.91] [95% CI, 1.91-2.36] vs 2.43 [0.70] [95% CI, 2.25-2.62]; P = .04) and TAU (2.93 [0.59] [95% CI, 2.63-3.22]; P < .001). The CBT adapted for ASD also outperformed standard-of-practice CBT and TAU on parent-reported scales of internalizing symptoms (estimated group mean differences: adapted vs standard-of-practice CBT, -0.097 [95% CI, -0.172 to -0.023], P = .01; adapted CBT vs TAU, -0.126 [95% CI, -0.243 to -0.010]; P = .04), ASD-associated social-communication symptoms (estimated group mean difference: adapted vs standard-of-practice CBT, -0.115 [95% CI, -0223 to -0.007]; P = .04; adapted CBT vs TAU: -0.235 [95% CI,-0.406 to -0.065]; P = .01); and anxiety-associated social functioning (estimated group mean difference: adapted vs standard-of-practice CBT, -0.160 [95% CI, -0.307 to -0.013]; P = .04; adapted CBT vs TAU: -0.284 [95% CI, -0.515 to -0.053]; P = .02).

With recent research advances in early identification that allow for pre-symptomatic detection of autism in infancy, scientists are looking forward to intervention during infancy. These advances may be supported by the identification of biologically based treatment and outcome measures that are sensitive and dimensional. The purpose of this review is to evaluate white matter neurodevelopment as a monitoring biomarker for early treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as used as exemplars. White matter has unique neurobiology, including a prolonged period of dynamic development. This developmental pattern may make white matter especially responsive to treatment. White matter develops aberrantly in children with ASD and FXS. Histologic studies in rodents have provided targets for FXS pharmacological intervention. However, pharmaceutical clinical trials in humans failed to garner positive clinical results. In this article, we argue that the use of neurobiological monitoring biomarkers may overcome some of these limitations, as they are objective, not susceptible to placebo effects, and are dimensional in nature. As the field moves towards earlier detection and early intervention for neurodevelopmental disorders, we encourage scientists to consider the advantages of using neurobiological features as monitoring biomarkers.","Swanson Meghan R, Hazlett Heather C","Journal of neurodevelopmental disorders","Animals, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Biomarkers, Brain, Early Medical Intervention, Fragile X Syndrome, Humans, Neurodevelopmental Disorders, White Matter","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31839003","Carolina Institute for Developmental Disabilities, Department of Psychiatry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, 27599, NC, USA.; School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences, University of Texas at Dallas, GR41, 800 W.

However, research on the clinical implications of the presence of autistic traits is scarce. This study aimed to investigate the impact of subclinical autistic traits in mentalization-based treatment (MBT) for concurrent borderline personality disorder (BPD) and substance use disorder (SUD). Based on the data of a randomized controlled feasibility study by Philips, Wennberg, Konradsson, and Franck (2018), secondary analyses were conducted. It was tested, if patients' (N = 46) levels of autistic traits were associated with treatment outcome measured in the course of and after treatment using interviews and self-report measures. Participants' autistic traits were not associated with the change in the severity of BPD throughout and at the end of the treatment. However, results showed associations between autistic traits and the change in patients' consumption of alcohol in the course of MBT. Furthermore, there was an association between autistic traits and the change in mentalizing capacity at the end of MBT, indicating that elevated autistic traits were associated with an improvement in mentalizing capacity. Autistic traits on a subclinical level do not appear to be a complicating factor in MBT for concurrent BPD and SUD. On the contrary, in terms of mentalizing capacity autistic traits might be associated with a larger potential for improvement or facilitate treatment outcome. Further research is needed to explore the role of higher autistic traits in treatment of this special patient group.","Kaltenegger Helena C, Philips Björn, Wennberg Peter","Scandinavian journal of psychology","Adult, Autistic Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, Comorbidity, Feasibility Studies, Female, Humans, Interpersonal Relations, Male, Mentalization, Psychotherapy, Group, Substance-Related Disorders, Treatment Outcome","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31840273","Department of Psychology, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Public Health Sciences, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden.",

Evidence-based psychological interventions have been successfully adapted to treat co-occurring anxiety, but there is little evidence about the usefulness of adapted cognitive-behavioural therapy for depression. To the authors' knowledge, to date there have been no randomised trials investigating the usefulness of low-intensity cognitive-behavioural therapy for depression in autism. The objectives of the study were to (1) develop a low-intensity psychological intervention for depression adapted for autism, (2) assess the feasibility and patient and therapist acceptability of the intervention, (3) estimate the rates of recruitment and retention for a full-scale randomised controlled trial and (4) identify an appropriate measure of depression to be used in a full-scale randomised controlled trial. The study comprised a randomised controlled trial (<i>n</i> = 70) with a nested qualitative evaluation (<i>n</i> = 21). Seventy eligible and consenting participants were randomly allocated to guided self-help or to treatment as usual. Adult autism services in two NHS regions. Adults with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder with depression, that is, a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 items score of ≥ 10. People who had attended more than six sessions of cognitive-behavioural therapy in the previous 6 months were excluded. The low-intensity intervention (guided self-help) comprised materials for nine individual sessions, based on behavioural activation adapted for autism, facilitated by therapist guides (coaches) who were graduate-level psychologists who attended training and regular supervision. Treatment as usual was standard NHS care for depression. Outcomes were measured 10, 16 and 24 weeks post randomisation using self-report and interview measures of depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, social function and quality of life, and a health-care and service use questionnaire. As this was a feasibility study also designed to identify the most appropriate measure of depression, it was not possible to specify the primary outcome measure or outcome point a priori. The aims of the study were met in full. The guided self-help intervention was feasible and well received by participants and coaches. The majority of allocated participants attended the intervention in full. The most practical outcome point was determined to be 16 weeks. There were differential rates of attrition across the treatment groups: 86% of the guided self-help group remained in the study at 24 weeks, compared with 54% of treatment as usual group. The qualitative study suggested that guided self-help had enhanced credibility with participants at the point of randomisation. Inter-rater reliability of the interview measure of depression was less than adequate, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from the prespecified sensitivity to change analyses. The intervention was feasible and well received. Although this feasibility study was not a fully powered trial, it provided some evidence that the guided self-help intervention was effective in reducing depressive symptoms. A full-scale clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness trial of the intervention is warranted. Improvements to the intervention materials as a result of qualitative interviews. Stakeholder consultation to consider future trial design, consider strategies to improve retention in a treatment as usual arm and select a self-report measure of depression to serve as the primary outcome measure.

Patients 10-17 years of age with a DSM-5 diagnosis of bipolar I depression were randomized to 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with flexibly dosed lurasidone (20-80 mg/day) (n = 173) or placebo (n = 170). The primary efficacy measure was change from baseline to week 6 in the Children's Depression Rating Scale, Revised (CDRS-R). Treatment response was defined as 50% or greater improvement on the CDRS-R from baseline to week 6. Cognitive function was evaluated with the computerized Brief Cogstate Battery at baseline and week 6. Analyses were adjusted for baseline BMI, as well as age. HsCRP was evaluated as a logarithmically transformed continuous variable and as a categorical variable dichotomized into lower (<1 mg/L) and higher (≥1 mg/L) subgroups. A significant interaction was found between baseline hsCRP and treatment group for change in CDRS-R score at study endpoint, with larger placebo-corrected effect sizes for lurasidone in the higher baseline hsCRP group (≥1 mg/L). A significant BMI-by-hsCRP-by-treatment interaction was found for response rate with higher baseline hsCRP levels associated with greater antidepressant response to lurasidone (vs. placebo) in the normal BMI range subgroup (NNT = 2 in higher hsCRP vs. NNT = 5 in lower hsCRP groups) but not in the overweight/obese patients (NNT = 6 in higher hsCRP vs. NNT = 5 in lower hsCRP). Similarly, a significant interaction effect was observed for the combination of hsCRP and BMI on the procognitive effect of lurasidone, with higher baseline hsCRP levels being associated with improvement in cognitive function for lurasidone (vs placebo) in the normal BMI range subgroup but not in overweight/obese patients. These results suggest that young patients with bipolar depression with normal weight and higher levels of pre-treatment CRP may show a greater placebo-adjusted improvement in depressive symptoms and cognitive performance when treated with lurasidone. If these findings are confirmed in future prospective studies, CRP and BMI may prove to be useful diagnostic and predictive biomarkers in the treatment with lurasidone of children and adolescents with bipolar depression.","Raison Charles L, Siu Cynthia, Pikalov Andrei, Tocco Michael, Loebel Antony","Brain, behavior, and immunity","Adolescent, Antipsychotic Agents, Bipolar Disorder, Body Mass Index, C-Reactive Protein, Child, Depression, Double-Blind Method, Humans, Lurasidone Hydrochloride, Prospective Studies, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Treatment Outcome","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31857217","Department of Human Development and Family Studies, School of Human Ecology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1300 Linden Drive, Madison, WI 53706, USA; Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 6001 Research Park Blvd, Madison, WI 53719, USA.

Data were described narratively prioritizing meta-analysis and randomized controlled trials but considering also open label trials and preliminary studies. The main conclusions were that only few drugs showed efficacy for reducing psychiatric symptoms associated to these developmental conditions, mainly risperidone and aripiprazole to treat irritability and methylphenidate and atomoxetine for hyperactivity and attention deficit. Evidence is inconclusive regarding the effectiveness of other drug groups. Novel therapeutic agents showed mixed results and quality of evidence is low; some of these agents aim at biologically targeted pharmacotherapy, which may lead to successful individualized treatment options in the future.

However, long-term follow-up studies, evaluating the possibility of long-lasting retention effects, are currently lacking. Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design, this pilot clinical trial explored the possibility of long-lasting behavioral effects of 4 weeks of intranasal oxytocin treatment (24 International Units once daily in the morning) in 40 adult men with ASD. To do so, self-report and informant-based questionnaires assessing core autism symptoms and characterizations of attachment were administered at baseline, immediately after 4 weeks of treatment (approximately 24 h after the last nasal spray administration), and at two follow-up sessions, 4 weeks and 1 year post-treatment. No treatment-specific effects were identified in the primary outcome assessing social symptoms (Social Responsiveness Scale, self- and informant-rated). In particular, with respect to self-reported social responsiveness, improvements were evident both in the oxytocin and in the placebo group, yielding no significant between-group difference (<i>p</i> = .37). Also informant-rated improvements in social responsiveness were not significantly larger in the oxytocin, compared to the placebo group (between-group difference: <i>p</i> = .19). Among the secondary outcome measures, treatment-specific improvements were identified in the Repetitive Behavior Scale and State Adult Attachment Measure, indicating reductions in self-reported repetitive behaviors (<i>p</i> = .04) and reduced feelings of avoidance toward others (<i>p</i> = .03) in the oxytocin group compared to the placebo group, up to 1 month and even 1 year post-treatment. Treatment-specific effects were also revealed in screenings of mood states (Profile of Mood States), indicating higher reports of ""vigor"" (feeling energetic, active, lively) in the oxytocin, compared to the placebo group (<i>p</i> = .03). While no treatment-specific improvements were evident in terms of core social symptoms, the current observations of long-term beneficial effects on repetitive behaviors and feelings of avoidance are promising and suggestive of a therapeutic potential of oxytocin treatment for ASD. However, given the exploratory nature of this pilot study, future studies are warranted to evaluate the long-term effects of OT administration further.

Eighty children and adolescents (2-17.5 years of age; 96% with autism spectrum disorder) who completed the double-blind, placebo-controlled trial were given 2 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg PedPRM nightly up to 104 weeks, followed by a 2-week placebo period to assess withdrawal effects. Improvements in child sleep disturbance and caregiver satisfaction with child sleep patterns, quality of sleep, and quality of life were maintained throughout the 104-week treatment period (p < .001 versus baseline for all). During the 2-week withdrawal placebo period, measures declined compared with the treatment period but were still improved compared with baseline. PedPRM was generally safe; the most frequent treatment-related adverse events were fatigue (6.3%), somnolence (6.3%), and mood swings (4.2%). Changes in mean weight, height, body mass index, and pubertal status (Tanner staging done by a physician) were within normal ranges for age with no evidence of delay in body mass index or pubertal development.

However, clinical evidence of its efficacy in young patients with ASD is limited. This was investigated in the present clinical trial of 83 patients, randomised to the bumetanide group (bumetanide treatment, 0.5 mg twice daily) or the control group (no bumetanide treatment). Primary [Children Autism Rating Scale (CARS)], secondary [Clinical Global Impressions (CGI)], and exploratory [inhibitory (γ-aminobutyric acid, GABA) and excitatory (glutamate, Glx) neurotransmitter concentrations measured in the insular cortex (IC) and visual cortex (VC) by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)] outcome measures were evaluated at baseline and at the 3-month follow-up. Side effects were monitored throughout the treatment course. Compared with the control group, the bumetanide group showed significant reduction in symptom severity, as indicated by both total CARS score and number of items assigned a score ≥ 3. The improvement in clinical symptoms was confirmed by CGI. GABA/Glx ratio in both the IC and VC decreased more rapidly over the 3-month period in the bumetanide group than that in the control group. This decrease in the IC was associated with the symptom improvement in the bumetanide group. Our study confirmed the clinical efficacy of bumetanide on alleviating the core symptoms of ASD in young children and it is the first demonstration that the improvement is associated with reduction in GABA/Glx ratios.

Oxytocin (OXT), as a neuropeptide, plays a role in emotional and social behaviors. <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i> (<i>L. reuteri</i>) supplementation led to an OXT-dependent behavioral improvement in ASD mouse models. Despite some promising results from animal studies, little is known about the efficacy of supplementation with <i>L. reuteri</i>, alone or with exogenous OXT therapy, on social-behavioral functions in ASD patients. This paper presents a protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a full trial comparing oral supplementation of <i>L. reuteri</i> probiotics and intranasal OXT spray to placebo on the effect of social and behavioral functions in ASD patients. The study will also capture preliminary estimates of the efficacy of the proposed interventions in ASD patients. This pilot trial is a two-staged, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Throughout the study (0-24 weeks), 60 patients with ASD will be randomly assigned to receive either oral <i>L. reuteri</i> probiotics or placebo. In the second study stage (13-24 weeks), all participants will receive intranasal OXT spray. As primary outcomes, serum OXT levels will be assayed and social behaviors will be assessed via the Autism Behavior Checklist and the Social Responsiveness Scale which are validated questionnaires, an objective emotional facial matching test, and a new video-based eye-tracking test. Secondary outcomes include the GI-severity-index and Bristol Stool Chart to assess GI function and gut microbiome/short-chain fatty acids. All the outcomes will be assessed at baseline and weeks 12 and 24. This pilot study will provide important information on the feasibility of recruitment, blinding and concealment, treatment administration, tolerability and adherence, specimen collection, outcome assessment, potential adverse effects, and the preliminary efficacy on both primary and secondary outcomes.

However, the neural mechanisms of symptom alleviation, and benefit of MBSR beyond education/support groups are unknown. Maladaptive forms of self-reflection are linked to ASD, depression, and anxiety. In this pilot study, we hypothesized (a) MBSR would reduce depression and anxiety in adults with ASD and (b) a mechanism of symptom alleviation would be increased blood oxygen level-dependent signal in neural self-reflection hubs. Twenty-eight adults were randomly assigned to an 8-week MBSR group (n = 15) or a support group (n = 13) that met for the same amount of time with relaxation education materials. Based on previous self-reflection literature in ASD, regions of interest (ROIs) were middle cingulate cortex (MCC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Only the MBSR group demonstrated significant reductions in depression, and neither group significantly changed in anxiety. Only the MBSR group increased activity of right MCC during self-reflection, and the increase correlated with depression alleviation. There were no changes in vmPFC for the MBSR group or either ROI for the support/education group. Seed-to-voxel connectivity analysis revealed that only the MBSR group increased functional connectivity between right MCC and pre/postcentral gyrus, suggesting MBSR may increase primary sensorimotor input to higher order cognitive brain regions. Taken together, MBSR may be effective for reducing depression in adults with ASD, and the neural mechanism may be increasing frontal circuit involvement during self-directed thought.","Pagni Broc A, Walsh Melissa J M, Foldes Emily, Sebren Ann, Dixon Maria V, Guerithault Nicolas, Braden B Blair","Journal of neuroscience research","Adolescent, Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Brain, Depressive Disorder, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Mindfulness, Pilot Projects, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32090389","College of Health Solutions, Arizona State University, Phoenix, AZ, USA.",

As an exploratory analysis, we investigated whether inflammatory state would modulate the effect of these nutrients on core symptoms of ASD. Methods<i>:</i> Seventy-three New Zealand children with ASD (2.5-8.0 years) completed a 12-month randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D (VID, 2000 IU/day), omega-3 LCPUFA; (OM, 722 mg/day docosahexaenoic acid), or both (VIDOM). Non-fasting baseline plasma interleukin-1β (IL-1β) was available for 67 children (VID = 15, OM = 21, VIDOM = 15, placebo = 16). Children were categorised as having undetectable/normal IL-1β (<3.2 pg/ml, <i>n</i>=15) or elevated IL-1β (≥3.2 pg/mL, <i>n</i> = 52). The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) questionnaire was used to assess core symptoms of ASD (baseline, 12-month). Mixed model repeated measure analyses (including all children or only children with elevated IL-1β) were used. We found evidence for an interaction between baseline IL-1β and treatment response for SRS-total, SRS-social communicative functioning, SRS-awareness and SRS-communication (all <i>P</i><sub>interaction</sub> < 0.10).

This study attempted to identify any potential therapeutic effects of bilateral anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied over the left and right prefrontal and motor areas on the clinical characteristics of children with ASD. Fifty children with confirmed ASD medical diagnoses were divided equally and randomly into a tDCS treatment group and a control group. The tDCS treatment group underwent 10 sessions (20-min durations, five per week) of bilateral anodal tDCS stimulation applied simultaneously over the left and right prefrontal and motor areas, whereas the control group underwent the same procedures but with the use of sham tDCS stimulation. Total scores and sub-scores of autism treatment evaluation checklist (ATEC) (language and communication; sociability; sensory awareness; and behavioral, health, and physical conditions) were measured before and after the tDCS treatment sessions of both groups. There were significant decreases in total ATEC scores (P = 0.014), sociability sub-scores (P = 0.021), and behavioral, health, and physical condition sub-scores (P = 0.011) in the tDCS treatment group. No significant changes were observed in total ATEC scores and sub-scores in the control group.

To date, however, the impact of multiple-dose IN-OT treatment on human neural circuitry is largely unknown, and also the possibility that long-term IN-OT use may induce long-lasting neural adaptations remains unexplored. Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, between-subject design (including 38 adult men with ASD), this treatment-mechanism study showed that 4 weeks of daily oxytocin administration (24 IU/day) significantly altered intrinsic (resting-state fMRI) functional connectivity of the amygdala to core regions of the ""social brain"" (particularly orbitofrontal cortex and superior temporal sulcus) up to 4 weeks and 1 year post treatment. The neural adaptations in functional coupling of the amygdala to the orbitofrontal cortex were associated with reduced feelings of avoidance toward others and-at the trend level-reduced repetitive behaviors. These observations contribute to a deeper mechanistic understanding of the neural substrates that underlie behavioral effects of multiple-dose IN-OT treatment, and provide initial insights into the long-lasting neural consequences of chronic IN-OT use on amygdala circuitry. Future studies are however warranted to further elucidate the long-term impact of IN-OT treatment on human neural circuitry and its behavioral consequences.","Alaerts Kaat, Bernaerts Sylvie, Prinsen Jellina, Dillen Claudia, Steyaert Jean, Wenderoth Nicole","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Administration, Intranasal, Adolescent, Adult, Amygdala, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Double-Blind Method, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Oxytocics, Oxytocin, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32161366","Department of Health Sciences and Technology, Neural Control of Movement Lab, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.; Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Group Biomedical Sciences, Neurorehabilitation Research Group, University of Leuven, KU Leuven, Belgium.

We included studies on manualized developmental and behavioral interventions for children with ASD aged <7 years according to DSM-III(R), DSM-IV(TR), DSM-5, and ICD-10. The publication dates ranged from 1 January 2011 to 31 August 2018 or as included in the NICE-children guidelines. Studies were included by an iterative hierarchy: systematic review > randomized-controlled trial > clinically controlled trial. Outcome measures were core ASD symptoms and precursor abilities, or language abilities. The interventions were collated by (1) frequency and (2) approach. The studies focused on low-intensive interventions targeting parental synchrony, the child's initiations, reciprocity, joint attention, play and imitation skills as well as comprehensive interventions. Improvement of core ASD symptoms regarding social communication was observed for low-intensive training of parental synchrony and child's reciprocity as well as for low-intensive comprehensive developmental interventions implementing natural-learning paradigms. High-frequency discrete trial interventions did not improve social communication. Language abilities improved by comprehensive interventions.

In this population, suicidal behaviour troubles patients, families, and specialists in the field because it is difficult to treat. At present, there is no documented effective therapy for suicidal behaviour in ASD (Autism Research 7:507-521, 2014; Crisis 35:301-309, 2014). Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) is an efficacious treatment programme for chronically suicidal and/or self-harm behaviour in patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (J Psychiatry 166:1365-1374, 2014; Linehan MM. Cognitive behavioural therapy of borderline personality disorder. 1993). This study will evaluate the efficacy of DBT in persons with ASD and suicidal/ self- destructive behaviour in a multicentre randomised controlled clinical trial. One hundred twenty-eight persons with autism and suicidal and/or self-harming behaviour will be recruited from specialised mental healthcare services and randomised into two conditions: 1) the DBT condition in which the participants have weekly individual cognitive behavioural therapy sessions and a 2.5 h skills training group session twice per week during 6 months, and 2) the treatment as usual condition which consists of weekly individual therapy sessions of 30-45 min with a psychotherapist or social worker. Assessments will take place at baseline, at post-treatment (6 months), and after a follow-up period of 12 months. The mediators will also be assessed at 3 months. The primary outcome is the level of suicidal ideation and behaviour. The secondary outcomes are anxiety and social performance, depression, core symptoms of ASD, quality of life, and cost-utility. Emotion regulation and therapeutic alliance are hypothesised to mediate the effects on the primary outcome. The results from this study will provide an evaluation of the efficacy of DBT treatment in persons with ASD on suicidal and self-harming behaviour.

However, to date, the effects of oxytocin administration on endogenous hormones have only been examined in neurotypical individuals. The need to consider multi-hormone interactions is particularly warranted in oxytocin trials for autism due to evidence of irregularities in both oxytocin and sex steroid systems. In this double-blind cross-over study, saliva samples were collected from 16 autistic and 29 neurotypical women before and after intranasal administration of 24 IU oxytocin or placebo. Oestradiol, testosterone, and oxytocin levels were quantified in saliva samples. Participants also completed the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) and Empathy Quotient (EQ) questionnaires. Distinct patterns of change in testosterone and oestradiol levels pre- to-post-administration were observed in autistic relative to neurotypical women (ANCOVA, p < 0.05 main effect of Group), controlling for sample collection time. The mean percent change oestradiol was + 8.8% for the autism group and - 13.0% for the neurotypical group (t = 1.81, p = 0.08), while the mean percent change testosterone was + 1.1% in the autism group and - 12.6% in the neurotypical group (t = 1.26, p = 0.22). In the oxytocin condition, the mean percent change oestradiol was + 12.6% in the autism group and - 6.9% in the neurotypical group (t = 1.78, p = 0.08), while the mean percent change testosterone was + 14.4% in the autism group and - 15.2% in the neurotypical group (t = 3.00, p = 0.006). Robust regression confirmed that group differences in percent change hormone levels were not driven by a small number of influential individuals. Baseline hormone levels did not differ between groups when considered individually. However, baseline testosterone relative to oestradiol (T:E2 ratio) was higher in autistic women (p = 0.023, Cohen's d = 0.63), and this ratio correlated positively and negatively with AQ and EQ scores, respectively, in the combined sample. Further studies with larger and more diverse autistic sample are warranted to confirm these effects. This study provides the first evidence that oxytocin influences endogenous testosterone levels in autistic individuals, with autistic women showing increases similar to previous reports of neurotypical men. These findings highlight the need to consider sex steroid hormones as a variable in future oxytocin trials.","Procyshyn Tanya L, Lombardo Michael V, Lai Meng-Chuan, Auyeung Bonnie, Crockford Sarah K, Deakin J, Soubramanian S, Sule A, Baron-Cohen Simon, Bethlehem Richard A I","Molecular autism","Administration, Intranasal, Adolescent, Adult, Autistic Disorder, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Estradiol, Female, Humans, Middle Aged, Oxytocin, Saliva, Testosterone, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32188502","Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, 18b Trumpington Road, Cambridge, CB2 8AH, UK.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.; South West London and St. George's Mental Health NHS Trust, London, UK.; Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, 18b Trumpington Road, Cambridge, CB2 8AH, UK. tlp30@cam.ac.uk.; Behavioural and Clinical Neuroscience Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.",

Growing evidence suggests that cognitive behaviour therapies and mindfulness-based therapies can help autistic individuals learn to manage feelings of anxiety but access to such therapies remains problematic. In the current pilot study, we examined whether existing online cognitive behaviour therapy and mindfulness-based therapy self-help tools can help reduce anxiety in autistic adults. Specifically, 35 autistic adults were asked to try either an existing online cognitive behaviour therapy (n = 16) or mindfulness-based therapy (n = 19) programme while a further 19 autistic adults served as a waitlist comparison group. A first important finding was that 23 of the 35 (66%) participants who tried the online tools completed them, suggesting that such tools are, in principle, acceptable to many autistic adults. In addition, adults in the cognitive behaviour therapy and mindfulness-based therapy conditions reported significant decreases in anxiety over 3 and to some extent also 6 months that were less apparent in the waitlist group of participants. On broader measures of mental health and well-being, the benefits of the online tools were less apparent.

In Toronto, Ontario (November 2014 to June 2017), a 20-session, 4-week course of 20 Hz rTMS targeting dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (90%RMT) was compared to sham stimulation in 16-35 year-olds with ASD (28 male/12 female), without intellectual disability, who had impaired everyday EF performance (n = 20 active/n = 20 sham). Outcome measures evaluated protocol feasibility and clinical effects of active vs. sham rTMS on EF performance. The moderating effect of baseline functioning was explored. Of eligible participants, 95% were enrolled and 95% of randomized participants completed the protocol. Adverse events across treatment arms were mild-to-moderate. There was no significant difference between active vs. sham rTMS on EF performance. Baseline adaptive functioning moderated the effect of rTMS, such that participants with lower baseline functioning experienced significant EF improvement in the active vs. sham group. Our pilot RCT demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of using high frequency rTMS targeting DLPFC in youth and young adults with autism. No evidence for efficacy of active versus sham rTMS on EF performance was found. However, we found promising preliminary evidence of EF performance improvement following active versus sham rTMS in participants with ASD with more severe adaptive functioning deficits.

"32309885","10.1002/14651858.Cd004407.Pub4","Vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella in children.","2020-04-20","Measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox) are serious diseases that can lead to serious complications, disability, and death. However, public debate over the safety of the trivalent MMR vaccine and the resultant drop in vaccination coverage in several countries persists, despite its almost universal use and accepted effectiveness. This is an update of a review published in 2005 and updated in 2012. To assess the effectiveness, safety, and long- and short-term adverse effects associated with the trivalent vaccine, containing measles, rubella, mumps strains (MMR), or concurrent administration of MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine (MMR+V), or tetravalent vaccine containing measles, rubella, mumps, and varicella strains (MMRV), given to children aged up to 15 years. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library 2019, Issue 5), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to 2 May 2019), Embase (1974 to 2 May 2019), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (2 May 2019), and ClinicalTrials.gov (2 May 2019). We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), prospective and retrospective cohort studies (PCS/RCS), case-control studies (CCS), interrupted time-series (ITS) studies, case cross-over (CCO) studies, case-only ecological method (COEM) studies, self-controlled case series (SCCS) studies, person-time cohort (PTC) studies, and case-coverage design/screening methods (CCD/SM) studies, assessing any combined MMR or MMRV / MMR+V vaccine given in any dose, preparation or time schedule compared with no intervention or placebo, on healthy children up to 15 years of age. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. We grouped studies for quantitative analysis according to study design, vaccine type (MMR, MMRV, MMR+V), virus strain, and study settings. Outcomes of interest were cases of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella, and harms. Certainty of evidence of was rated using GRADE. We included 138 studies (23,480,668 participants). Fifty-one studies (10,248,159 children) assessed vaccine effectiveness and 87 studies (13,232,509 children) assessed the association between vaccines and a variety of harms. We included 74 new studies to this 2019 version of the review. Effectiveness Vaccine effectiveness in preventing measles was 95% after one dose (relative risk (RR) 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.13; 7 cohort studies; 12,039 children; moderate certainty evidence) and 96% after two doses (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.28; 5 cohort studies; 21,604 children; moderate certainty evidence). The effectiveness in preventing cases among household contacts or preventing transmission to others the children were in contact with after one dose was 81% (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.89; 3 cohort studies; 151 children; low certainty evidence), after two doses 85% (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.75; 3 cohort studies; 378 children; low certainty evidence), and after three doses was 96% (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.23; 2 cohort studies; 151 children; low certainty evidence). The effectiveness (at least one dose) in preventing measles after exposure (post-exposure prophylaxis) was 74% (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.50; 2 cohort studies; 283 children; low certainty evidence). The effectiveness of Jeryl Lynn containing MMR vaccine in preventing mumps was 72% after one dose (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.76; 6 cohort studies; 9915 children; moderate certainty evidence), 86% after two doses (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.35; 5 cohort studies; 7792 children; moderate certainty evidence). Effectiveness in preventing cases among household contacts was 74% (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.49; 3 cohort studies; 1036 children; moderate certainty evidence). Vaccine effectiveness against rubella is 89% (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.42; 1 cohort study; 1621 children; moderate certainty evidence). Vaccine effectiveness against varicella (any severity) after two doses in children aged 11 to 22 months is 95% in a 10 years follow-up (rate ratio (rr) 0.05, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.08; 1 RCT; 2279 children; high certainty evidence). Safety There is evidence supporting an association between aseptic meningitis and MMR vaccines containing Urabe and Leningrad-Zagreb mumps strains, but no evidence supporting this association for MMR vaccines containing Jeryl Lynn mumps strains (rr 1.30, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.56; low certainty evidence). The analyses provide evidence supporting an association between MMR/MMR+V/MMRV vaccines (Jeryl Lynn strain) and febrile seizures. Febrile seizures normally occur in 2% to 4% of healthy children at least once before the age of 5. The attributable risk febrile seizures vaccine-induced is estimated to be from 1 per 1700 to 1 per 1150 administered doses. The analyses provide evidence supporting an association between MMR vaccination and idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura (ITP). However, the risk of ITP after vaccination is smaller than after natural infection with these viruses. Natural infection of ITP occur in 5 cases per 100,000 (1 case per 20,000) per year. The attributable risk is estimated about 1 case of ITP per 40,000 administered MMR doses. There is no evidence of an association between MMR immunisation and encephalitis or encephalopathy (rate ratio 0.90, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.61; 2 observational studies; 1,071,088 children; low certainty evidence), and autistic spectrum disorders (rate ratio 0.93, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.01; 2 observational studies; 1,194,764 children; moderate certainty). There is insufficient evidence to determine the association between MMR immunisation and inflammatory bowel disease (odds ratio 1.42, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.16; 3 observational studies; 409 cases and 1416 controls; moderate certainty evidence). Additionally, there is no evidence supporting an association between MMR immunisation and cognitive delay, type 1 diabetes, asthma, dermatitis/eczema, hay fever, leukaemia, multiple sclerosis, gait disturbance, and bacterial or viral infections. Existing evidence on the safety and effectiveness of MMR/MMRV vaccines support their use for mass immunisation. Campaigns aimed at global eradication should assess epidemiological and socioeconomic situations of the countries as well as the capacity to achieve high vaccination coverage. More evidence is needed to assess whether the protective effect of MMR/MMRV could wane with time since immunisation.","Di Pietrantonj Carlo, Rivetti Alessandro, Marchione Pasquale, Debalini Maria Grazia, Demicheli Vittorio","The Cochrane database of systematic reviews","Adolescent, Age Factors, Autistic Disorder, Chickenpox Vaccine, Child, Child, Preschool, Clinical Trials as Topic, Crohn Disease, Epidemiologic Studies, Humans, Infant, Measles, Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine, Mumps, Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Rubella, Seizures, Febrile, Vaccines, Attenuated","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32309885","Italian Medicine Agency - AIFA, Signal Management Unit, Post-Marketing Surveillance Department, Via del Tritone 181, Rome, Italy, 00187.; SC Farmacia Ospedaliera ASL, Alessandria, Italy.; Azienda Sanitaria Locale ASL AL, Servizio Regionale di Riferimento per l'Epidemiologia, SSEpi-SeREMI, Via Venezia 6, Alessandria, Italy, 15121.; ASL CN2 Alba Bra, Dipartimento di Prevenzione - S.Pre.S.A.L, Via Vida 10, Alba, Piemonte, Italy, 12051.",

A randomized, double-blind trial was conducted at one site in the Sacramento, California, metropolitan area. Fourteen participants were assigned to the lovastatin group; two participants terminated early from the study. Sixteen participants were assigned to the placebo group. Lovastatin or placebo was administered orally in a capsule form, starting at 10 mg and increasing weekly or as tolerated by 10 mg increments, up to a maximum dose of 40 mg daily. A PILI was delivered to both groups for 12 weeks, with 4 activities per week, through video teleconferencing by an American Speech-Language Association-certified Speech-Language Pathologist, in collaboration with a Board-Certified Behavior Analyst. Parents were taught to use a set of language facilitation strategies while interacting with their children during a shared storytelling activity. The main outcome measures included absolute change from baseline to final visit in the means for youth total number of story-related utterances, youth number of different word roots, and parent total number of story-related utterances. Significant increases in all primary outcome measures were observed in both treatment groups. Significant improvements were also observed in parent reports of the severity of spoken language and social impairments in both treatment groups. In all cases, the amount of change observed did not differ across the two treatment groups. Although gains in parental use of the PILI-targeted intervention strategies were observed in both treatment groups, parental use of the PILI strategies was correlated with youth gains in the placebo group and not in the lovastatin group. Participants in both groups demonstrated significant changes in the primary outcome measures. The magnitude of change observed across the two groups was comparable, providing additional support for the efficacy of the use of PILI in youth with FXS.

Participants included 36 children diagnosed with ASD, 6-17 years of age, who were medically or psychiatrically hospitalized. Children in the intervention group received a brief ABA intervention and were compared to children in the evaluation and monitoring-only group. Families and staff recommended the intervention, children receiving the intervention demonstrated significantly more improvement in unblinded ratings of clinical severity, data from physicians indicated a positive effect of the intervention on levels of staffing and restraints and attending medical providers universally reported satisfaction and benefit of the intervention. Improvements in challenging behaviors were not significantly different as reported by parents, and the length of hospitalization did not differ between the groups. Ultimately, the outcomes of this pilot study suggest incorporating specialized ABA-based assessment and intervention during hospitalization may be feasible and well accepted by clinicians and families. However, future research must address potent methodological challenges related to capturing meaningful data during hospitalizations in order to answer questions of ultimate pragmatic, clinical, and system-level benefits.

A secondary aim was assessment of the effect of long-term lurasidone on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The treatment sample in the current study consisted of clinically stable patients with schizophrenia (N = 223) who had completed a 12-month, double-blind study of lurasidone vs. risperidone. In the current extension study, all patients received 6 months of open-label treatment with lurasidone, either continuing lurasidone assigned during the preceding double-blind trial, or switching from double-blind risperidone to lurasidone. Safety and tolerability parameters included body weight, prolactin, and metabolic laboratory tests. Six months of OL treatment with lurasidone was generally well-tolerated, with a low incidence of parkinsonism (4.5%) and akathisia (3.1%). Overall, few adverse events were rated as severe (4.9%), and discontinuation due to an adverse event was low in the lurasidone continuation vs. risperidone switch groups (3.7% vs. 6.9%). In the lurasidone continuation versus risperidone switch groups, change from OL baseline to 6-month endpoint (observed case) was observed in mean body weight (- 0.6 vs. -2.6 kg), median total cholesterol (- 4.0 vs. + 4.5 mg/dL), triglycerides (- 4.5 vs. -5.5 mg/dL), glucose (0.0 vs. -3.0 mg/dL) and prolactin (males, + 0.15 vs. -11.2 ng/mL; females, + 1.3 vs. -30.8 ng/mL). Improvement in PANSS total score was maintained, from OL baseline to endpoint in the continuation vs. switch groups (+ 1.0 vs. -1.0; OC). In this 6-month extension study, lurasidone treatment was generally well-tolerated and associated with minimal effects on weight, metabolic parameters, and prolactin levels.

TSC is strongly associated with broad neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder symptomatology. Preclinical TSC studies have indicated altered neuronal chloride homeostasis affecting the polarity of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) ergic transmission as a potential treatment target. Bumetanide, a selective NKCC1 chloride importer antagonist, may attenuate depolarizing GABA action, and in that way reduce disease burden. In this open-label pilot study, we tested the effect of bumetanide on a variety of neurophysiological, cognitive, and behavioral measures in children with TSC. Participants were treated with bumetanide (2dd 0.5-1.0 mg) for 13 weeks in an open-label trial. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability (ABC-I) subscale was chosen as the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included other behavioral questionnaires in addition to event-related potentials (ERP) and neuropsychological tests if tolerated. Additionally, the treatment effect on seizure frequency and quality of life was assessed. Endpoint data were collected at baseline, after 91 days of treatment and after a 28-day wash-out period. Fifteen patients (8-21-years old) with TSC were included of which 13 patients completed the study. Treatment was well-tolerated with only expected adverse events due to the diuretic effects of bumetanide. Irritable behavior (ABC-I) showed significant improvement after treatment in 11 out of 13 patients (t(12) = 4.41, p = .001, d = .773). A favorable effect was also found for social behavior (Social Responsiveness Scale) (t(11) = 4.01, p = .002, d = .549) and hyperactive behavior (ABC-hyperactivity subscale) (t(12) = 3.65, p = .003, d = .686). Moreover, patients rated their own health-related quality of life higher after treatment. At baseline, TSC patients showed several atypical ERPs versus typically developing peers of which prepulse inhibition was significantly decreased in the TSC group. Neuropsychological measurements showed no change and bumetanide had no effect on seizure frequency. The sample size and open-label design of this pilot study warrant caution when interpreting outcome measures. Bumetanide treatment is a potential treatment to alleviate the behavioral burden and quality of life associated with TSC. More elaborate trials are needed to determine the application and effect size of bumetanide for the TSC population.

The biological basis of this is poorly understood but may include neurochemically mediated differences in the responsivity of key 'limbic' regions (including amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc)). Emerging evidence also suggests that ASD may be a disorder of brain temporal dynamics. Moreover, serotonin (5-HT) has been shown to be a key regulator of both facial-emotion processing and brain dynamics, and 5-HT abnormalities have been consistently implicated in ASD. To date, however, no one has examined how 5-HT influences the dynamics of facial-emotion processing in ASD. Therefore, we compared the influence of 5-HT on the responsivity of brain dynamics during facial-emotion processing in individuals with and without ASD. Participants completed a facial-emotion processing fMRI task at least 8 days apart using a randomised double-blind crossover design. At each visit they received either a single 20-mg oral dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram or placebo. We found that citalopram (which increases levels of 5-HT) caused sustained activation in key limbic regions during processing of negative facial emotions in adults with ASD-but not in neurotypical adults. The neurotypical adults' limbic response reverted more rapidly to baseline following a 5-HT-challenge. Our results suggest that serotonergic homoeostatic control of the temporal dynamics in limbic regions is altered in adults with ASD, and provide a fresh perspective on the biology of ASD.","Wong Nichol M L, Findon James L, Wichers Robert H, Giampietro Vincent, Stoencheva Vladimira, Murphy Clodagh M, Blainey Sarah, Ecker Christine, Murphy Declan G, McAlonan Grainne M, Daly Eileen","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Cross-Over Studies, Emotions, Facial Expression, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Serotonin","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388538","Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK. nichol.wong@kcl.ac.uk.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; Department of Neuroimaging, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy, Goethe University Frankfurt am Main, Frankfurt, Germany.",

In the current randomized placebo-controlled within-subject experiment on 40 healthy males, we investigated the robustness of this facilitation of attention by intranasal oxytocin (24IU) towards social cues. Eye-tracking measures of preference for dynamic and static social vs. non-social stimuli were taken in four different paradigms where autistic individuals tend to exhibit reduced interest in social stimuli. Additionally, we investigated whether oxytocin increases attention towards the eyes relative to other salient face regions in an emotional face paradigm. Results showed that the time spent viewing both dynamic and static social vs. non-social stimuli was negatively associated with trait autism and significantly increased following intranasal oxytocin. For face stimuli, oxytocin primarily increased gaze towards the eyes of fearful expression faces but not for other face emotions. Overall, our findings demonstrate that oxytocin significantly shifts gaze preference towards social vs. non-social stimuli and to the eyes of fearful faces.

Given that ACT promotes broad and flexible repertoires of behaviour as well as neutralizing the ubiquitous psychological processes theorized to be responsible for much human suffering, such an approach may hold promise. The use of ACT-informed parenting interventions offers another alternative to solely behavioural approaches but it remains relatively understudied and in need of further exploration. The current systematic review, which searched four databases, aimed to collate all ACT interventions that included parental therapeutic components in the treatment of various child presenting difficulties. The review also rated the methodological rigour of the ACT evidence-base for this type of treatment format. Twenty-seven individual studies covering a broad spectrum of presenting problems were included, comprising of 1,155 participants. A large proportion of studies were within-group designs with a smaller number using randomized controlled trials. The majority of studies reported improvements on either parent report symptoms regarding child physical or psychological functioning as well as parent-reported measures of stress, depression, and anxiety. Similar improvements were noted on a number of ACT mechanisms of change outcomes, including mindfulness, acceptance, and cognitive fusing. These gains were evident for parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders, chronic pain, and significant physical health difficulties. Maintenance or further treatment gains were often reported at follow-up. These positive findings are tempered by low levels of methodological rigour common in some of the studies included. Despite these limitations, ACT holds promise as a transdiagnostic intervention that can help with the parenting of children with a range of psychological and physical difficulties. ACT has accrued a relatively strong evidence base for a range of psychological difficulties. Despite some methodological shortcomings, ACT shows promise as an intervention to help parents manage stress and difficulties especially in relation to children with autism, chronic pain, and physical health needs. Further research is required in comparing ACT to more established treatments and helping consolidate initial positive findings.","Byrne Gary, Ghráda Áine Ní, O'Mahony Teresa, Brennan Emma","Psychology and psychotherapy","Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Anxiety, Child, Humans, Parenting","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32406169","Health Service Executive, Dublin, Ireland.; School of Psychology, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland.",

We assessed the effect of three neuroleptic strategies on refractory agitation in patients with cancer with terminal delirium. In this single-centre, double-blind, parallel-group, randomised trial, patients with advanced cancer, aged at least 18 years, admitted to the palliative and supportive care unit at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA), with refractory agitation, despite low-dose haloperidol, were randomly assigned to receive intravenous haloperidol dose escalation at 2 mg every 4 h, neuroleptic rotation with chlorpromazine at 25 mg every 4 h, or combined haloperidol at 1 mg and chlorpromazine at 12·5 mg every 4 h, until death or discharge. Rescue doses identical to the scheduled doses were administered at inception, and then hourly as needed. Permuted block randomisation (block size six; 1:1:1) was done, stratified by baseline Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) scores. Research staff, clinicians, patients, and caregivers were masked to group assignment. The primary outcome was change in RASS score from time 0 to 24 h. Comparisons among group were done by modified intention-to-treat analysis. This completed study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03021486. Between July 5, 2017, and July 1, 2019, 998 patients were screened for eligibility, with 68 being enrolled and randomly assigned to treatment; 45 received the masked study interventions (escalation n=15, rotation n=16, combination n=14). RASS score decreased significantly within 30 min and remained low at 24 h in the escalation group (n=10, mean RASS score change between 0 h and 24 h -3·6 [95% CI -5·0 to -2·2]), rotation group (n=11, -3·3 [-4·4 to -2·2]), and combination group (n=10, -3·0 [-4·6 to -1·4]), with no difference among groups (p=0·71).

However, few studies were placebo-controlled, and there is no study on persons with an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis. Our aim was to study effects of Synbiotic 2000 on psychiatric symptoms and functioning in children and adults with ADHD without an autism diagnosis. Children and adults (n = 182) with an ADHD diagnosis completed the nine weeks randomized double-blind parallel placebo-controlled trial examining effects of Synbiotic 2000 on the primary endpoints ADHD symptoms, autism symptoms and daily functioning, and the secondary endpoint emotion regulation, measured using the questionnaires SNAP-IV, ASRS, WFIRS, SCQ, AQ and DERS-16. Levels at baseline of plasma C-reactive protein and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), central to leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion facilitating inflammatory responses in tissues, were measured using Meso Scale Discovery. Synbiotic 2000 and placebo improved ADHD symptoms equally well, and neither active treatment nor placebo had any statistically significant effect on functioning or sub-diagnostic autism symptoms. However, Synbiotic 2000, specifically, reduced sub-diagnostic autism symptoms in the domain restricted, repetitive and stereotyped behaviors in children, and improved emotion regulation in the domain of goal-directed behavior in adults. In children with elevated sVCAM-1 levels at baseline as well as in children without ADHD medication, Synbiotic 2000 reduced both the total score of autism symptoms, and the restricted, repetitive and stereotyped behaviors. In adults with elevated sVCAM-1 at baseline, Synbiotic 2000 significantly improved emotion regulation, both the total score and four of the five subdomains. To conclude, while no definite Synbiotic 2000-specific effect was detected, the analysis of those with elevated plasma sVCAM-1 levels proposed a reduction of autism symptoms in children and an improvement of emotion regulation in adults with ADHD.

The Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test was acquired prior to the first scan to test whether OT effects were moderated by baseline social-emotional abilities. OT did not modulate behavioural performances but reduced activation in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus compared with placebo while inferring others' social emotions. Furthermore, the relationship between brain activation and task performance after OT administration was moderated by baseline social-emotional abilities. While task accuracy during inferring others' social emotion increased with decreasing activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus in CHR-P individuals with low social-emotional abilities, there was no such relationship in CHR-P individuals with high social-emotional abilities.

Face recognition behavior and associated brain responses can be enhanced by intranasal administration of oxytocin. It is unknown whether oxytocin can also augment voice-identity recognition mechanisms. To find it out is particularly relevant for individuals who have difficulties recognizing voice identity such as individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We conducted a combined behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study to investigate voice-identity recognition following intranasal administration of oxytocin or placebo in a group of adults diagnosed with ASD (full-scale intelligence quotient > 85) and pairwise-matched typically developing (TD) controls. A single dose of 24 IU oxytocin was administered in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and cross-over design. In the control group, but not in the ASD group, administration of oxytocin compared to placebo increased responses to recognition of voice identity in contrast to speech in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus/gyrus (pSTS/G) - a region implicated in the perceptual analysis of voice-identity information. In the ASD group, the right pSTS/G responses were positively correlated with voice-identity recognition accuracy in the oxytocin condition, but not in the placebo condition. Oxytocin did not improve voice-identity recognition performance at the group level. The ASD compared to the control group had lower right pSTS/G responses to voice-identity recognition.

Their main social deficits include atypical eye contact and difficulty in understanding facial expressions, both of which are associated with an abnormality of the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (rpSTS). It is still undetermined whether it is possible to improve the social function of ALT individuals through noninvasive neural modulation. To this end, we randomly assigned ALT individuals into the real (<i>n</i> = 16) and sham (<i>n</i> = 16) stimulation groups. All subjects received five consecutive days of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) on the rpSTS. Eye tracking data and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired on the first and sixth days. The real group showed significant improvement in emotion recognition accuracy after iTBS, but the change was not significantly larger than that in the sham group. Resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) between the rpSTS and the left cerebellum significantly decreased in the real group than the sham group after iTBS. At baseline, rsFC in the left cerebellum was negatively correlated with emotion recognition accuracy. Our findings indicated that iTBS of the rpSTS could improve emotion perception of ALT individuals by modulating associated neural networks.

Acute exercise mobilizes effector lymphocytes and VSTs to the circulation and augments the ex vivo manufacture of VSTs. This study determined if β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptor (AR) signaling precipitated the VST response to acute exercise. Healthy participants (n = 12) completed 30 min of steady-state cycling exercise after ingesting a placebo, a β<sub>1 + 2</sub> AR antagonist (nadolol) or a β<sub>1</sub> AR antagonist (bisoprolol). Circulating VSTs to cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and adenovirus (AdV) antigens were enumerated before and after exercise, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured with viral peptides for 8 days to expand multi-VSTs. Compared with placebo, nadolol blunted the exercise-induced mobilization of CMV-VSTs (Δ VSTs/100,000 CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells = 93 ± 104 vs. 22 ± 91 for placebo and nadolol, respectively; p = 0.036), while bisoprolol did not, despite both drugs evoking similar reductions in exercising heart rate and blood pressure. Circulating AdV and EBV VSTs (VSTs/mL blood) only increased after exercise with placebo. Although not significant, nadolol partially mitigated exercise-induced increases in multi-VST expansion, particularly in participants that demonstrated an exercise-induced increase in VST expansion. We conclude that exercise-induced enhancements in VST mobilization and expansion are at least partially β<sub>2</sub> AR mediated, thus highlighting a role for the β<sub>2</sub> AR in targeted therapy for the augmentation of VST immune cell therapeutics in the allogeneic adoptive transfer setting. Moreover, long-term regular exercise may provide additional viral protection in the host through frequent β<sub>2</sub> AR-dependent mobilization and redistribution of VSTs cumulated with each bout of exercise.","Kunz Hawley E, Agha Nadia H, Hussain Maryam, LaVoy Emily C, Smith Kyle A, Mylabathula Preteesh, Diak Douglass, Baker Forrest L, O'Connor Daniel P, Bond Richard A, Katsanis Emmanuel, Bollard Catherine M, Simpson Richard J","Cell stress & chaperones","Adrenergic beta-1 Receptor Antagonists, Adrenergic beta-2 Receptor Antagonists, Adult, Antiviral Agents, Blood Pressure, Catecholamines, Cell Proliferation, Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy, Cytokines, Exercise, Female, Heart Rate, Humans, Hydrocortisone, Lactic Acid, Male, Peptides, Phenotype, Receptors, Adrenergic, beta, Species Specificity, T-Lymphocytes, Viruses, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32779001","Laboratory of Integrated Physiology, Department of Health and Human Performance, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA. rjsimpson@email.arizona.edu.; College of Pharmacy, Science and Engineering Research Center, The University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA.; Department of Nutritional Sciences, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.; Center for Cancer and Immunology Research, Children's Research Institute, Children's National Health System and The George Washington University, Washington, D.C., USA.; Laboratory of Integrated Physiology, Department of Health and Human Performance, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.; Merced Experimental Social and Health Psychology Laboratory, Stress and Health Laboratory, Department of Psychological Sciences, University of California Merced, Merced, CA, USA.",

The great strawman of autism has been so emphasized by the vaccine industry that it, and it alone, often appears in authoritative discussions of adverse effects of the MMR and other vaccines. By dismissing the chimerical vaccine/autism controversy, vaccine defenders often dismiss all genuinely neurological aftereffects of the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) and other vaccines, including well-documented events, such as relatively rare cases of encephalopathy and encephalitis. This report explains that autism is not a physical or neurological disorder. It is not caused by injury or disease of the brain. It is a developmental disorder that has no physical origins and no physical symptoms. It is extremely unlikely that vaccines are causing autism; but it is extremely likely that they are causing more neurological damage than currently appreciated, some of it resulting in psychosocial disabilities that can be confused with autism and other psychosocial disorders. This confusion between a developmental, psychosocial disorder and a physical neurological disease has played into the hands of interest groups who want to deny that vaccines have any neurological and associated neuropsychiatric effects. A review of the scientific literature, textbooks, and related media commentary is integrated with basic clinical knowledge. This report shows how scientific sources have used the vaccine/autism controversy to avoid dealing with genuine neurological risks associated with vaccines and summarizes evidence that vaccines, including the MMR, can cause serious neurological disorders. Manufacturers have been allowed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to gain vaccine approval without placebo-controlled clinical trials. The misleading vaccine autism controversy must be set aside in favor of examining actual neurological harms associated with vaccines, including building on existing research that has been ignored. Manufacturers of vaccines must be required to conduct placebo-controlled clinical studies for existing vaccines and for government approval of new vaccines. Many probable or confirmed neurological adverse events occur within a few days or weeks after immunization and could be detected if the trials were sufficiently large. Contrary to current opinion, large, long-term placebo-controlled trials of existing and new vaccines would be relatively easy and safe to conduct.","Breggin Peter R","The International journal of risk & safety in medicine","Autistic Disorder, Humans, Measles, Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine, Mumps, Rubella","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894253","Private Practice of Psychiatry, Clinical Psychopharmacology and Forensics, Ithaca, New York, USA.",

Stress associated with teaching is more critical among teachers teaching children with special needs in general and those with autism specifically, partly due to the heterogeneous nature of the disorders. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of Rational Emotive Occupational Health Coaching (REOHC) in minimizing job stress in teachers of children with autism (CWA). A group-randomized waitlist control-trial design was adopted. A sample of 87 teachers of CWA who participated in the study was randomized into the immediate intervention group (IIG) and waitlist group (WLG). Participants were evaluated on 3 occasions: pretest, post-test and follow-up. Three instruments (Occupational Stress Index, Perceived Occupational Stress Scale and Stress Symptom Scale) were used to measure dimensions of job stress. After the pretest exercise, the IIG participated in a 2-hour REOHC programme weekly for a period of 12 weeks. Post- and follow-up evaluations were conducted respectively at 2 weeks and 3 months after the REOHC programme. Those in WLG were exposed to the REOHC after the follow-up assessment. Data collected were analysed using t-test statistics, repeated measures analysis of variance and bar charts. Results revealed that the perceived stress and stress symptoms of the REOHC group reduced significantly over WLG at post-test, and follow-up assessments. Changes in the occupational stress index scores across pre-, post- and follow-up measurements were minimal and could not account for a significant difference between the IIG and WLG. It was concluded that REOHC is effective in reducing subjective feelings and physiological symptoms of job stress, even when the objective stressors remain constant among teachers of CWA and other employees who work in stressful occupational environments.","Ogba Francisca N, Onyishi Charity N, Victor-Aigbodion Vera, Abada Ifeanyichukwu M, Eze Uchenna N, Obiweluozo Patience E, Ugodulunwa Christiana N, Igu Ntasiobi C N, Okorie Cornelius O, Onu JeanFrance C, Eze Angela, Ezeani Emmanuel O, Ebizie Elizabeth N, Onwu Alexandra O","Medicine","Adult, Autistic Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Child, Child, Preschool, Children with Disabilities, Female, Humans, Male, Occupational Stress, School Teachers, Surveys and Questionnaires","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32898998","Department of Political Science.; School of General Studies, University of Nigeria Nsukka.; Department of Educational Foundations, University of Nigeria, Nsukka.; Department of Educational Foundations, Alex Ekwueme University, Ndufu-Alike, Ebonyi State Nigeria.",

The study consisted of the 2-week screening phase, the 26-week medication phases I and II, and the 2-week follow-up phase. Children received 1, 2, or 4 mg melatonin granules orally in the medication phases. Variables of sleep status including sleep onset latency (SOL), aberrant behaviors listed on the Aberrant Behavior Check List-Japanese version (ABC-J), and safety were examined.

However, limited research has investigated the heterogeneity of the visual preferences in individuals with ASD. In the current study, we explored the visual preferences to different movement types (repetitive, biological, and random) in children with ASD using a paired preferential looking paradigm. Thirty-nine children with ASD and 37 typically developing (TD) children participated in our study, with their eye movements recorded as the index of visual preferences. We examined the differences of visual preferences between the ASD and TD group, and the heterogeneity of visual preferences within the ASD group. We found group differences between children with ASD and TD children: Overall, the ASD group preferred repetitive movements while the TD group preferred biological movements. We also detected heterogeneity of visual preferences within the ASD group: Although the majority of children with ASD preferred repetitive movements as previous studies reported, 9 out of 39 children with ASD preferred biological movements similarly as their TD peers. Moreover, the visual preference patterns were correlated with autistic symptoms, especially the socio-communicative impairments. Our study provided evidence of heterogeneity of visual attention and main visual preference to repetitive movements in children with ASD. The findings add to the body of literature of the heterogeneous behavioral symptoms and the atypical visual preferences in individuals with ASD. LAY SUMMARY: The current study examined visual preferences to biological, repetitive, and random movements in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We showed a pair of two videos representing two types of movements (random, repetitive, or biological movements) to children with ASD and typically developing children. We found the main visual preferences for repetitive movements and heterogeneity of visual attention within the ASD group.

The ACAT group will receive a weekly 100-min session for 6 weeks, regular medical care, and one follow-up session. In this ongoing clinical trial, we will compare the scores of the measures recorded in the pre- and post-intervention stages between the ACAT and TAU groups. A total of 41 patients out of a target of 48 have participated in the trial to date. The primary outcome measure is the Autism Knowledge Questionnaire. Secondary outcome measures include Barriers to Access to Care Evaluation 3rd Edition, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales second edition, the Parenting Resilience Elements Questionnaire, the General Health Questionnaire 12, and the Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children assessments, as well as an electroencephalographic recording. It is expected that participants in the ACAT group will significantly increase their self-understanding and awareness of ASD symptoms compared to those in the TAU group. Additionally, the ACAT group is expected to exhibit improved social adaptation and mental health if children and parents are able to better understand the ASD characteristics through sessions.

Green tea consumption may reduce the risk of cardiovascular outcomes and total mortality, whereas green tea or its catechin components has been reported to decrease plasma concentrations of a hydrophilic β blocker, nadolol, in humans. The aim of this study was to evaluate possible effects of green tea extract (GTE) on the lisinopril pharmacokinetics. In an open-label, randomized, single-center, 2-phase crossover study, 10 healthy subjects ingested 200 mL of an aqueous solution of GTE containing ~ 300 mg of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate, a major catechin component in green tea, or water (control) when receiving 10 mg of lisinopril after overnight fasting. The geometric mean ratio (GTE/control) for maximum plasma concentration and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of lisinopril were 0.289 (90% confidence interval (CI) 0.226-0.352) and 0.337 (90% CI 0.269-0.405), respectively. In contrast, there were no significant differences in time to reach maximum lisinopril concentration (6 hours in both phases) and renal clearance of lisinopril (57.7 mL/minute in control vs. 56.9 mL/minute in GTE). These results suggest that the extent of intestinal absorption of lisinopril was significantly impaired in the presence of GTE, whereas it had no major effect on the absorption rate and renal excretion of lisinopril. Concomitant use of lisinopril and green tea may decrease oral exposure to lisinopril, and therefore result in reduced therapeutic efficacy.","Misaka Shingen, Ono Yuko, Uchida Atsushi, Ono Tomoyuki, Abe Osamu, Ogata Hiroshi, Sato Hideyuki, Suzuki Masahiko, Onoue Satomi, Shikama Yayoi, Shimomura Kenju","Clinical and translational science","Administration, Oral, Adult, Catechin, Cross-Over Studies, Fasting, Female, Food-Drug Interactions, Healthy Volunteers, Humans, Intestinal Absorption, Lisinopril, Male, Tea, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33048477","Center for Medical Education and Career Development, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima, Japan.; Laboratory of Biopharmacy, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Shizuoka, Suruga-ku, Japan.; Department of Bioregulation and Pharmacological Medicine, School of Medicine, Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine, Fukushima, Japan.; Department of Pharmacy, University of Yamanashi Hospital, Chuo-city, Japan.",

In this framework, probiotics (recently named ""psychobiotics"") may modulate brain activity and function, possibly improving the behavioral profiles of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We evaluated the effects of probiotics on autism in a double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 85 preschoolers with ASD (mean age, 4.2 years; 84% boys). Participants were randomly assigned to probiotics (De Simone Formulation) (n=42) or placebo (n=43) for six months. Sixty-three (74%) children completed the trial. No differences between groups were detected on the primary outcome measure, the Total Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule - Calibrated Severity Score (ADOS-CSS). An exploratory secondary analysis on subgroups of children with or without Gastrointestinal Symptoms (GI group, n= 30; NGI group, n=55) revealed in the NGI group treated with probiotics a significant decline in ADOS scores as compared to that in the placebo group, with a mean reduction of 0.81 in Total ADOS CSS and of 1.14 in Social-Affect ADOS CSS over six months. In the GI group treated with probiotics we found greater improvements in some GI symptoms, adaptive functioning, and sensory profiles than in the GI group treated with placebo. These results suggest potentially positive effects of probiotics on core autism symptoms in a subset of ASD children independent of the specific intermediation of the probiotic effect on GI symptoms.

Recently, noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) methods, namely transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), have been examined as possible new therapeutic options for modifying the pathological neuroplasticity involved in neuropsychiatric disorders including ASD. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review on the therapeutic uses of tDCS and repetitive TMS (rTMS) in ASD patients. A systematic search was performed on Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane and Embase. Original articles reporting the use of tDCS or rTMS to treat ASD were screened and studied by two researchers independently based on PRISMA guidelines. We found 32 eligible studies including 8 tDCS reports, 23 rTMS reports and one report with both tDCS and rTMS. These studies comprised 6 case-reports, 9 non-controlled trials and 17 controlled trials which assessed NIBS effects on the three cognitive, behavioral and biological dimensions in ASD. Existing evidence demonstrates that NIBS methods could be helpful for treating some dimensions of ASD such as repetitive behavior, sociability or some aspects of executive and cognitive functions. However, such evidence should be regarded with care because of the quality of original researches and serious publication bias as well as the heterogeneity of data.

In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, we investigated the effects of single-dose and multiple-dose IN-OT treatment (4 weeks of daily (24 IU) administrations) on brain activity related to processing emotional states. Thirty-eight adult men with ASD (aged between 18 and 35 years) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging of the posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTS) and amygdala regions while processing emotional states from point-light biological motion. In line with prior research, a single dose of IN-OT induced a reliable increase in pSTS brain activity during the processing of point-light biological motion, but no consistent long-term changes in pSTS activity were induced after the multiple-dose treatment. In terms of bilateral amygdala, the multiple-dose treatment induced a consistent attenuation in brain activity, which outlasted the period of actual administrations until four weeks and one year post-treatment. Critically, participants with stronger attenuations in amygdala-activity showed greater behavioral improvements, particularly in terms of self-reported feelings of avoidant attachment and social functioning. Together, these observations provide initial insights into the long-lasting neural consequences of chronic IN-OT use on amygdala functioning and provide first indications that the acute versus chronic effects of IN-OT administration may be qualitatively different. Larger studies are however warranted to further elucidate the long-term impact of IN-OT treatment on human neural substrates and its behavioral consequences.","Bernaerts Sylvie, Boets Bart, Steyaert Jean, Wenderoth Nicole, Alaerts Kaat","Translational psychiatry","Administration, Intranasal, Adolescent, Adult, Amygdala, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Double-Blind Method, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Oxytocin, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33159033","Department of Health Sciences and Technology, Neural Control of Movement Lab, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.; Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Research Group for Neurorehabilitation, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.; Leuven Autism Research (LAuRes), KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.; Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Research Group for Neurorehabilitation, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium. kaat.alaerts@kuleuven.be.",

The Incredible Explorers (6-week program), a yoga-informed intervention program for children (8-12 years), was developed to understand whether, for children on the autism spectrum, the training could improve the ability to self-regulate, reduce anxiety and sleep problems, and increase awareness of emotions. In our sample, 61 children with one of their parents completed the program. Half of the group received the intervention, and the other half had to wait until the yoga group completed their trial. The participants were asked to give their feedback immediately after program completion and at 6-week follow-up. Compared to the group that was waiting to receive the intervention, parents in the yoga group reported significant gains for their children in regulating their overall executive control immediately after the session and again at follow-up. The parents reported a reduction in some of the sleep problems post-treatment. Children indicated an improved ability to communicate their feelings and willingness to analyze their emotions post-intervention.

Previously, interactions of exogenously administered OT with its endogenous production have been demonstrated following single-dose administrations. However, the impact of repeated, long-term OT use on endogenous salivary OT levels is unknown. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study with between-subject design, 34 adult men with ASD were either assigned to a four-week treatment of once-daily intranasal OT administrations (24 IU) or placebo. Salivary OT samples were obtained before and after the treatment period as well as at two follow-up sessions, four weeks and one year after cessation of the treatment. Receiving OT intranasally but not placebo reliably increased endogenous salivary levels of OT immediately post-treatment and at the follow-up session four weeks post treatment, indicating an interaction between exogenously administered OT and its endogenous production. Notably, increases in salivary OT at the four-week follow-up session were most pronounced in individuals with larger behavioral improvements in ASD social symptoms. These results suggest that OT's positive effects on social behaviors may lead to a self-perpetuating elevation of OT levels through a feed-forward triggering of its own release. Together, the current investigation provides initial evidence that repeated intranasal administration of OT can induce long-lasting changes in endogenous salivary OT levels, presumably through a positive spiral of OT release.","Alaerts Kaat, Steyaert Jean, Vanaudenaerde Bart, Wenderoth Nicole, Bernaerts Sylvie","European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Administration, Intranasal, Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Double-Blind Method, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Oxytocin","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33309460","University of Leuven, KU Leuven, Belgium, Department of Neurosciences, Group Biomedical Sciences, Psychiatry Research Group, Belgium; Leuven Autism Research Consortium, KU Leuven, Belgium.; University of Leuven, KU Leuven, Belgium, Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Group Biomedical Sciences, Neurorehabilitation Research Group, Belgium; Leuven Autism Research Consortium, KU Leuven, Belgium.; ETH Zurich, Switzerland, Department of Health Sciences and Technology, Neural Control of Movement Lab, Switzerland.; University of Leuven, KU Leuven, Belgium, Department of Chronic Diseases, Metabolism and Ageing, Group Biomedical Sciences, Pneumology Research Group, Belgium.; University of Leuven, KU Leuven, Belgium, Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Group Biomedical Sciences, Neurorehabilitation Research Group, Belgium; Leuven Autism Research Consortium, KU Leuven, Belgium.

Targeting individual MMPs may offer a safer therapeutic potential for several diseases. We assessed the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of FP-025, a novel, highly selective oral matrix metalloproteinase-12 inhibitor, in healthy subjects. Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were conducted. Study I was a first-in-man study, evaluating eight single ascending doses (SADs) (50-800 mg) in two formulations: i.e., neat FP-025 in capsule (API-in-Capsule) and in an amorphous solid dispersion (ASD-in-Capsule) formulation. In Study II, three multiple ascending doses (MADs) (100, 200, and 400 mg, twice daily) of FP-025 (ASD-in-Capsule) were administered for 8 days, including a food-effect evaluation. Ninety-six subjects were dosed. Both formulations were well tolerated with one adverse event (AE) reported in the 800 mg API-in-Capsule SAD group and seven AEs throughout the MAD groups. The exposure to FP-025 was low with the API-in-Capsule formulation; it increased dose-dependently with the ASD-in-Capsule formulation, with which exposure to FP-025 increased in a greater-than-dose-proportional manner at lower doses (≤ 100 mg) but less proportionally at higher doses. The elimination half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) was between 6 (Study I) and 8 h (Study II). Accumulation of FP-025 was approximately 1.7-fold in the MAD study. Food intake delayed the rate of absorption, but without effect in the extent of absorption or bioavailability.

However, no studies have systematically investigated the effects of oxytocin on dynamic or directional aspects of functional connectivity. The present study employed a novel computational framework to investigate these latter aspects in 15 oxytocin-sensitive regions using data from randomized placebo-controlled between-subject resting state functional MRI studies incorporating 200 healthy subjects. In order to characterize the temporal dynamics, the 'temporal state' was defined as a temporal segment of the whole functional MRI signal which exhibited a similar functional interaction pattern among brain regions of interest. Results showed that while no significant effects of oxytocin were found on brain temporal state related characteristics (including temporal state switching frequency, probability of transitions between neighboring states, and averaged dwell time on each state) oxytocin extensively (n = 54 links) modulated effective connectivity among the 15 regions. The effects of oxytocin were primarily characterized by increased effective connectivity both between and within emotion, reward, salience, attention and social cognition processing networks and their interactions with the default mode network. Top-down control over emotional processing regions such as the amygdala was particularly affected. Oxytocin also increased effective homotopic interhemispheric connectivity in almost all these regions. Additionally, the effects of oxytocin on effective connectivity were sex-dependent, being more extensive in males. Overall, these findings suggest that modulatory effects of oxytocin on both within- and between-network interactions may underlie its functional influence on social-emotional behaviors, although in a sex-dependent manner. These findings may be of particular relevance to potential therapeutic use of oxytocin in psychiatric disorders associated with social dysfunction, such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, where directionality of treatment effects on causal interactions between networks may be of key importance .","Jiang Xi, Ma Xiaole, Geng Yayuan, Zhao Zhiying, Zhou Feng, Zhao Weihua, Yao Shuxia, Yang Shimin, Zhao Zhongbo, Becker Benjamin, Kendrick Keith M","NeuroImage","Adult, Brain, Brain Mapping, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Image Processing, Computer-Assisted, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Nerve Net, Neural Pathways, Oxytocin, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33359350","The Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, MOE Key Lab for Neuroinformation, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.

In addition to challenges caused by core symptoms, maladaptive behaviors such as aggression can be associated with ASD and can further disrupt functioning and quality of life. For adults with ASD, these behaviors can portend adverse outcomes (e.g., harm to others or to the individual with ASD, hindering of employment opportunities, criminal justice system involvement). This article reviews the scientific literature to provide an update on evidence-based interventions for aggression in adults with ASD. A search of the electronic databases CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycINFO was conducted using relevant search terms. After reviewing titles, abstracts, full-length articles, and reference lists, 70 articles were identified and reviewed. The strongest (controlled trial) evidence suggests beneficial effects of risperidone, propranolol, fluvoxamine, vigorous aerobic exercise, and dextromethorphan/quinidine for treating aggression in adults with ASD, with lower levels of evidence supporting behavioral interventions, multisensory environments, yokukansan, and other treatments. Additional randomized, controlled trials using consistent methodology that adequately addresses sources of bias are needed to determine which treatments are reliably effective in addressing aggression in adults with ASD. In the meantime, considering efficacy and adverse effect/long-term risk profiles, a practical approach could start with functional assessment-informed behavioral interventions along with encouragement of regular, vigorous aerobic exercise to target aggression in adults with ASD, with pharmacotherapy employed if these interventions are unavailable or inadequate based on symptom acuity.","Im David S","Harvard review of psychiatry","Adult, Aggression, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Communication, Humans, Quality of Life","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33417375","From the University of Michigan Hospital, Department of Psychiatry, University of Michigan Medical School.",

Aberrant auditory signal detection (ASD) is one of the pathogenetic mechanisms for AVH. We investigated the correlates of ASD with AVH and the impact of single-session tDCS on ASD in SZ patients. The ASD performance in SZ patients was compared with matched healthy controls (HC) (N = 24). Subsequently, the effect of single-session tDCS on ASD in SZ patients (N = 24) with AVH was examined in a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, cross-over design. The true and sham tDCS were administered (anode at the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and cathode at the left temporoparietal junction) on two different days. ASD task was performed before and after each session of tDCS. Auditory hallucination rating scores correlated significantly with false alarm rate, discriminability index, and response bias.

Increasingly, scientific evidence suggests a neurobiological basis of these emotional, social and cognitive deficits in individuals with ASD. The aim of this randomized controlled brain self-regulation intervention study was to investigate whether the core symptomatology of ASD could be reduced via an electroencephalography (EEG) based brain self-regulation training of Slow Cortical Potentials (SCP). 41 male adolescents with ASD were recruited and allocated to a) an experimental group undergoing 24 sessions of EEG-based brain training (n<sub>1</sub> = 21), or to b) an active control group undergoing conventional treatment (n<sub>2</sub> = 20), that is, clinical counseling during a 3-months intervention period. We employed real-time neurofeedback training recorded from a fronto-central electrode intended to enable participants to volitionally regulate their brain activity. Core autistic symptomatology was measured at six time points during the intervention and analyzed with Bayesian multilevel approach to characterize changes in core symptomatology. Additional Bayesian models were formulated to describe the neural dynamics of the training process as indexed by SCP (time-domain) and power density (PSD, frequency-domain) measures. The analysis revealed a substantial improvement in the core symptomatology of ASD in the experimental group (reduction of 21.38 points on the Social Responsiveness Scale, SD = 5.29), which was slightly superior to that observed in the control group (evidence Ratio = 5.79). Changes in SCP manifested themselves as different trajectories depending on the different feedback conditions and tasks. Further, the model of PSD revealed a continuous decrease in delta power, parallel to an increase in alpha power. Most notably, a non-linear (quadratic) model turned out to be better at predicting the data than a linear model across all analyses. Taken together, our analyses suggest that behavioral and neural processes of change related to neurofeedback training are complex and non-linear. Moreover, they have implications for the design of future trials and training protocols.","Konicar L, Radev S, Prillinger K, Klöbl M, Diehm R, Birbaumer N, Lanzenberger R, Plener P L, Poustka L","NeuroImage.

We tested (1) BOL-DP-O-01-W, a whole-plant cannabis extract containing cannabidiol and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol at a 20:1 ratio and (2) BOL-DP-O-01, purified cannabidiol and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol at the same ratio. Participants (N = 150) received either placebo or cannabinoids for 12-weeks (testing efficacy) followed by a 4-week washout and predetermined cross-over for another 12 weeks to further assess tolerability. Registered primary efficacy outcome measures were improvement in behavioral problems (differences between whole-plant extract and placebo) on the Home Situation Questionnaire-ASD (HSQ-ASD) and the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale with disruptive behavior anchor points (CGI-I). Secondary measures were Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2) and Autism Parenting Stress Index (APSI). Changes in Total Scores of HSQ-ASD (primary-outcome) and APSI (secondary-outcome) did not differ among groups. Disruptive behavior on the CGI-I (co-primary outcome) was either much or very much improved in 49% on whole-plant extract (n = 45) versus 21% on placebo (n = 47; p = 0.005). Median SRS Total Score (secondary-outcome) improved by 14.9 on whole-plant extract (n = 34) versus 3.6 points after placebo (n = 36); p = 0.009). There were no treatment-related serious adverse events.

The biological basis of these deficits is unknown but may include the serotonergic system, which is involved both in regulating EF in neurotypical populations and in the pathophysiology of ASD. We previously demonstrated that reducing serotonin by acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) shifts differences in brain function during performance of EF tasks towards control levels. However, ATD cannot be easily used in the clinic, and we therefore need to adopt alternative approaches to challenge the serotonin system. Hence, we investigated the role of the serotonergic modulator tianeptine on EF networks in ASD. We conducted a pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging study, using a randomized double-blind crossover design, to compare the effect of an acute dosage of 12.5 mg tianeptine and placebo on brain activation during two EF tasks (of response inhibition and sustained attention) in 38 adult males: 19 with ASD and 19 matched controls. Under placebo, compared to controls, individuals with ASD had atypical brain activation in response inhibition regions including the inferior frontal cortex, premotor regions and cerebellum. During sustained attention, individuals with ASD had decreased brain activation in the right middle temporal cortex, right cuneus and left precuneus. Most of the case-control differences in brain function observed under placebo conditions were abolished by tianeptine administration. Also, within ASD individuals, brain functional differences were shifted significantly towards control levels during response inhibition in the inferior frontal and premotor cortices. We conducted a pilot study using a single dose of tianeptine, and therefore, we cannot comment on long-term outcome. Our findings provide the first evidence that tianeptine can shift atypical brain activation during EF in adults with ASD towards control levels. Future studies should investigate whether this shift in the biology of ASD is maintained after prolonged treatment with tianeptine and whether it improves clinical symptoms.","Wichers Robert H, Findon James L, Jelsma Auke, Giampietro Vincent, Stoencheva Vladimira, Robertson Dene M, Murphy Clodagh M, Blainey Sarah, McAlonan Grainne, Ecker Christine, Rubia Katya, Murphy Declan G M, Daly Eileen M","Molecular autism","Adult, Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic, Attention, Autistic Disorder, Brain, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Executive Function, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Pilot Projects, Thiazepines, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33608048","Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy, University Hospital Frankfurt am Main, Goethe-University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, The Sackler Centre for Translational Neurodevelopment, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, PO50 De Crespigny Park, Denmark Hill, London, SE5 8AF, UK.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, The Sackler Centre for Translational Neurodevelopment, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, PO50 De Crespigny Park, Denmark Hill, London, SE5 8AF, UK. rob.wichers@kcl.ac.uk.; Department of Neuroimaging, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; Behavioural and Developmental Psychiatry Clinical Academic Group, South London and Maudsley NHS Trust, London, UK.",

However, previous results on the efficacy of repeated administrations of oxytocin are controversial. Recently, we reported time-course changes in the efficacy of the neuropeptide underlying the controversial effects of repeated administration; however, the underlying mechanisms remained unknown. The current study explored metabolites representing the molecular mechanisms of oxytocin's efficacy using high-throughput metabolomics analysis on plasma collected before and after 6-week repeated intranasal administration of oxytocin (48 IU/day) or placebo in adult males with ASD (N = 106) who participated in a multi-center, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial. Among the 35 metabolites measured, a significant increase in N,N-dimethylglycine was detected in the subjects administered oxytocin compared with those given placebo at a medium effect size (false discovery rate (FDR) corrected P = 0.043, d = 0.74, N = 83). Furthermore, subgroup analyses of the participants displaying a prominent time-course change in oxytocin efficacy revealed a significant effect of oxytocin on N,N-dimethylglycine levels with a large effect size (P<sub>FDR</sub> = 0.004, d = 1.13, N = 60). The increase in N,N-dimethylglycine was significantly correlated with oxytocin-induced clinical changes, assessed as changes in quantifiable characteristics of autistic facial expression, including both of improvements between baseline and 2 weeks (P<sub>FDR</sub> = 0.006, r = - 0.485, N = 43) and deteriorations between 2 and 4 weeks (P<sub>FDR</sub> = 0.032, r = 0.415, N = 37). The metabolites changes caused by oxytocin administration were quantified using peripheral blood and therefore may not directly reflect central nervous system changes. Our findings demonstrate an association of N,N-dimethylglycine upregulation with the time-course change in the efficacy of oxytocin on autistic social deficits. Furthermore, the current findings support the involvement of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor and neural plasticity to the time-course change in oxytocin's efficacy.

To date, there is no effective medication that can improve social communication and interaction in ASD, and effect sizes of behaviour-based psychotherapy remain in the low to medium range. Consequently, there is a clear need for new treatment options. ASD is associated with altered activation and connectivity patterns in brain areas which process social information. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a technique that applies a weak electrical current to the brain in order to modulate neural excitability and alter connectivity. Combined with specific cognitive tasks, it allows to facilitate and consolidate the respective training effects. Therefore, application of tDCS in brain areas relevant to social cognition in combination with a specific cognitive training is a promising treatment approach for ASD. A phase-IIa pilot randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, parallel-group clinical study is presented, which aims at investigating if 10 days of 20-min multi-channel tDCS stimulation of the bilateral tempo-parietal junction (TPJ) at 2.0 mA in combination with a computer-based cognitive training on perspective taking, intention and emotion understanding, can improve social cognitive abilities in children and adolescents with ASD. The main objectives are to describe the change in parent-rated social responsiveness from baseline (within 1 week before first stimulation) to post-intervention (within 7 days after last stimulation) and to monitor safety and tolerability of the intervention. Secondary objectives include the evaluation of change in parent-rated social responsiveness at follow-up (4 weeks after end of intervention), change in other ASD core symptoms and psychopathology, social cognitive abilities and neural functioning post-intervention and at follow-up in order to explore underlying neural and cognitive mechanisms. If shown, positive results regarding change in parent-rated social cognition and favourable safety and tolerability of the intervention will confirm tDCS as a promising treatment for ASD core-symptoms.

The majority of adult ASD patients suffer from comorbid conditions such as depression and anxiety. Therapy options for adult ASD patients are lacking, with presently no available evidence-based interventions in Germany. Recently, two interventions to improve social responsiveness have been published. FASTER (""Freiburger Asperger-Spezifische Therapie für ERwachsene"" = Freiburg Asperger-specific therapy for adults) is a manualized group psychotherapy program including three modules on psychoeducation, stress regulation management, and non-verbal and verbal social communication training with videotaped tasks. SCOTT&EVA (""Social Cognition Training Tool"", and its enhancement ""Emotionen Verstehen und Ausdruecken"" = understanding and expressing emotions) is a computer-based training program to enhance social cognition including video and audio material of emotional expressions and complex real-life social situations. Initial studies for both programs have shown good feasibility and efficacy. Three hundred sixty adult participants with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) will take part in a randomized controlled three-armed multi-center trial to prove the efficacy of manualized group psychotherapy and a manualized computer-based training program. Both interventions will be compared with a treatment as usual (TAU) group, aiming to establish evidence-based psychotherapy approaches for adult individuals with ASD. The primary outcome is evaluated by parents, spouses, or others who have sufficient insight into the respective participant's social communication and interaction, and will be measured with the Social Responsiveness Scale. First, each of both interventions will be compared to TAU. If at least one of the differences is significant, both interventions will be compared against each other. The primary outcome will be measured at baseline (T0) and 4 months after baseline (T1). The trial is the first to validate psychiatric therapeutic and training interventions for adult ASD patients in Germany. A trial is needed because the prevalence of ASD in adulthood without intellectual disability is high, and no evidence-based intervention can be offered in Germany.

Despite its high prevalence, reaching 1/54 children and 1/45 adults in the United States, no pharmacological treatment is still directed to core symptoms of ASD, encompassing social and communication deficits, repetitive behaviors, restricted interests, and abnormal sensory processing. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art of psychopharmacological therapy available today for ASD in children and adolescents, in order to foster best practices and to organize new strategies for future research. To date, atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone and aripiprazole represent the first line of intervention for hyperactivity, impulsivity, agitation, temper outbursts or aggression towards self or others. Tricyclic antidepressants are less prescribed because of uncertain efficacy and important side effects. SSRIs, especially fluoxetine and sertraline, may be effective in treating repetitive behaviors (anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms) and irritability/agitation, while mirtazapine is more helpful with sleep problems. Low doses of buspirone have shown some efficacy on restrictive and repetitive behaviors in combination with behavioral interventions. Stimulants, and to a lesser extent atomoxetine, are effective in reducing hyperactivity, inattention and impulsivity also in comorbid ASD-ADHD, although with somewhat lower efficacy and greater incidence of side effects compared to idiopathic ADHD. Clonidine and guanfacine display some efficacy on hyperactivity and stereotypic behaviors. For several other drugs, case reports and open-label studies suggest possible efficacy, but no randomized controlled trial has yet been performed. Research in the pediatric psychopharmacology of ASD is still faced with at least two major hurdles: (a) Great interindividual variability in clinical response and side effect sensitivity is observed in the ASD population. This low level of predictability would benefit from symptom-specific treatment algorithms and from biomarkers to support drug choice; (b) To this date, no psychoactive drug appears to directly ameliorate core autism symptoms, although some indirect improvement has been reported with several drugs, once the comorbid target symptom is abated.","Persico Antonio M, Ricciardello Arianna, Lamberti Marco, Turriziani Laura, Cucinotta Francesca, Brogna Claudia, Vitiello Benedetto, Arango Celso","Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry","Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic, Antipsychotic Agents, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Central Nervous System Stimulants, Child, Clinical Trials as Topic, Humans, Psychopharmacology, Psychotropic Drugs, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33857522","Child & Adolescent Psychiatry Unit, ""Franz Tappeiner"" Hospital, Merano (BZ), Italy.; Interdepartmental Program ""Autism 0-90"", ""G.

Forty-five RCTs and 6 quasi RCTs of 2485 children and adolescents with ASDs were selected for the final meta-analysis. There was no significant difference between CBT and control for symptoms related to ASD based on self-reported outcomes (standard mean difference: -0.09; 95% confidence interval: -0.42 to 0.24; <i>P</i> = .593), whereas CBT significantly improved the symptoms related to ASD based on informant-reported outcomes, clinician-rated outcomes, and task-based outcomes. Moreover, the pooled standard mean differences indicated that CBT has no significant effect on symptoms of social-emotional problems based on self-reported outcomes. The quality of included studies was low to modest, significant heterogeneity among the included studies for all investigated outcomes was detected, and publication bias was inevitable.

The best outcomes were obtained after 20 sessions of high-frequency dTMS with OCD patients, where, in addition to clinical improvement, patients showed amelioration of cognitive functions, specifically in cognitive control domains. The studies on patients with depression appear to show inconsistent results, from cognitive improvement in open-label studies to no improvement versus sham dTMS in controlled trials. Experimental research in healthy volunteers suggests an influence of dTMS on memory and self-agency, and also contain contradictory results. Most studies did not demonstrate a significant improvement in cognitive functioning.

Specifically, autistic people demonstrated hyperplasticity in response to theta-burst stimulation (TBS). We hypothesized that autistic adults would display hyperplasticity to TBS and that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) - which potentiates brain inhibitory mechanisms - would 'stabilize' hyperplasticity. Using a randomized, cross-over design, plasticity was assessed using TBS in the left motor cortex (M1) in 31 autistic adults and 30 sex-, intelligence quotient-, and age-matched controls. Autistic adults (n = 29) were further randomized (1:1) to receive a single session of active (n = 14) or sham (n = 15) rTMS (6000 pulses at 20 Hz) over left M1 and plasticity was reassessed on the next day following rTMS. Both long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) were significantly increased in the ASD group, indicating hyperplasticity. Active, but not sham rTMS, attenuated LTD in autistic adults. We provided further evidence for the presence of brain hyperplasticity in ASD. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show preliminary evidence that an excessive LTD in ASD can be 'stabilized' using rTMS. Such 'stabilizing' effect of rTMS on LTP was not observed, likely due to small sample size or a more specific 'attenuating' effect of rTMS on LTD, compared to LTP. These findings indicate atypical brain inhibitory mechanisms behind hyperplasticity in ASD.

"34018333","10.1002/Aur.2538","Contribution of the right temporoparietal junction and ventromedial prefrontal cortex to theory of mind in autism: A randomized, sham-controlled tDCS study.","2021-08-01","Theory of mind (ToM) is the ability to attribute subjective mental states to oneself and others and is significantly impaired in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A frontal-posterior network of regions including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is involved in ToM. Previous studies show an underactivation of these regions in ASD. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation method for causally investigating brain-behavior relationships via induction of cortical excitability alterations. tDCS, mostly over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, has been increasingly applied for improving behavioral problems in ASD leaving other potentially interesting regions untouched. Here we investigated contribution of the vmPFC and right TPJ in ToM abilities of ASD children via tDCS in a pilot study. Sixteen children with ASD (mean age = 10.7 ± 1.9) underwent three tDCS sessions (1 mA, 20 min) in a randomized, sham-controlled design. Stimulation protocols included: (a) anodal vmPFC tDCS, (b) anodal r-TPJ tDCS, and (c) sham tDCS. ToM abilities were explored during tDCS using the theory of mind test (TOMT). Our results show that activation of the vmPFC with anodal tDCS significantly improved ToM in children with ASD compared with both, r-TPJ tDCS, and sham stimulation. Specifically, precursors of ToM (e.g., emotion recognition, perception, and imitation) and elementary ToM skills (e.g., first-order mental state reasoning) were significantly improved by anodal vmPFC tDCS. Based on these results, the vmPFC could be a potential target region for the reduction of ASD symptoms via noninvasive brain stimulation, which should be examined in larger detail in future studies. LAY SUMMARY: Theory of mind (ToM) is the ability to infer mental states of oneself and others, which is impaired in autism. Brain imaging studies have shown involvement of two brain regions in ToM (ventromedial prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal junction) which are underactivated in autism. We increased activation of these regions via noninvasive brain stimulation in this experiment to see how it would affect ToM abilities in autism.

This type of joint social attention is impaired in disorders such as autism. Previous research has demonstrated that the neuropeptide oxytocin can facilitate attention toward social cues, although to date no study in humans has investigated its influence on socially directed gaze or on associations of the latter with autistic and empathic traits. In a within-subject, randomized, placebo-controlled trial we used eye-tracking to investigate the effects of intranasal oxytocin (24 IU) on socially directed gaze toward one of two objects in 40 adult male subjects. Subjects viewed videos of an actor and actress directing their gaze toward one of two objects by either moving only their eyes, moving both their eyes and head, or moving their eyes and head and pointing with a finger. Results showed that OXT increased the proportion of time subjects viewed the object the actor or actress were looking/pointing at across all three conditions, although unexpectedly we found no associations with trait autism or empathy under either placebo or OXT treatments. These findings demonstrate that OXT can facilitate socially directed gaze following to promote mutual attention toward objects which may be potentially beneficial therapeutically in disorders with impaired social communication and interaction.","Le Jiao, Zhao Weihua, Kou Juan, Fu Meina, Zhang Yingying, Becker Benjamin, Kendrick Keith M","Psychophysiology","Adult, Attention, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Empathy, Eye-Tracking Technology, Fixation, Ocular, Humans, Male, Oxytocin, Social Perception, Visual Perception, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34032304","The Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, MOE Key Laboratory for Neuroinformation, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.",

Previous clinical trials of oral SF demonstrated positive clinical effects on behavior in young men and changes in urinary metabolomics in children with ASD. We conducted a 15-week randomized parallel double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial with 15-week open-label treatment and 6-week no-treatment extensions in 57 children, ages 3-12 years, with ASD over 36 weeks. Twenty-eight were assigned SF and 29 received placebo (PL). Clinical effects, safety and tolerability of SF were measured as were biomarkers to elucidate mechanisms of action of SF in ASD. Data from 22 children taking SF and 23 on PL were analyzed. Treatment effects on the primary outcome measure, the Ohio Autism Clinical Impressions Scale (OACIS), in the general level of autism were not significant between SF and PL groups at 7 and 15 weeks. The effect sizes on the OACIS were non-statistically significant but positive, suggesting a possible trend toward greater improvement in those on treatment with SF (Cohen's d 0.21; 95% CI - 0.46, 0.88 and 0.10; 95% CI - 0.52, 0.72, respectively). Both groups improved in all subscales when on SF during the open-label phase. Caregiver ratings on secondary outcome measures improved significantly on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) at 15 weeks (Cohen's d - 0.96; 95% CI - 1.73, - 0.15), but not on the Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2). Ratings on the ABC and SRS-2 improved with a non-randomized analysis of the length of exposure to SF, compared to the pre-treatment baseline (p < 0.001). There were significant changes with SF compared to PL in biomarkers of glutathione redox status, mitochondrial respiration, inflammatory markers and heat shock proteins. Clinical laboratory studies confirmed product safety. SF was very well tolerated and side effects of treatment, none serious, included rare insomnia, irritability and intolerance of the taste and smell. The sample size was limited to 45 children with ASD and we did not impute missing data. We were unable to document significant changes in clinical assessments during clinical visits in those taking SF compared to PL. The clinical results were confounded by placebo effects during the open-label phase. SF led to small yet non-statistically significant changes in the total and all subscale scores of the primary outcome measure, while for secondary outcome measures, caregivers' assessments of children taking SF showed statistically significant improvements compared to those taking PL on the ABC but not the SRS-2. Clinical effects of SF were less notable in children compared to our previous trial of a SF-rich preparation in young men with ASD. Several of the effects of SF on biomarkers correlated to clinical improvements. SF was very well tolerated and safe and effective based on our secondary clinical measures.

Current perspectives on the neuroendocrine substrates of this behavioral regulation highlight a role of the peptide hormone oxytocin (OXT), but it remains unclear whether the facilitating effects of OXT vary as a function of facial familiarity. Here, a total of 73 healthy participants was enrolled in an eye-tracking experiment specifically designed to test whether intranasal OXT (24 IU) augments gaze duration toward the eye-region across four different face categories: the participants' own face, the face of their romantic partner, the face of a familiar person (close friend) or an unfamiliar person (a stranger). We found that OXT treatment induced a tendency to spend more time looking into the eyes of familiar persons (partner and close friend) as compared to placebo. This effect was not evident in the self and unfamiliar conditions. Independent of treatment, volunteers scoring high on autistic-like traits (AQ-high) spent less time looking at the eyes of all faces except their partner. Collectively, our results show that the OXT system is involved in facilitating an attentional bias towards the eye region of familiar faces, which convey safety and support, especially in anxious contexts. In contrast, autistic-like traits were associated with reduced attention to the eye region of a face regardless of familiarity and OXT-treatment.","Marsh Nina, Scheele Dirk, Postin Danilo, Onken Marc, Hurlemann Rene","Frontiers in endocrinology","Administration, Intranasal, Attention, Attitude, Autistic Disorder, Eye-Tracking Technology, Face, Female, Humans, Male, Oxytocin, Personality, Recognition, Psychology, Saliva, Young Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34079520","Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Carl von Ossietzky University Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany.",

This study examines the implementation of Reciprocal Imitation Training (RIT)-an NDBI-by community Early Intervention (EI; IDEA Part C) providers serving toddlers from birth to 3 years. Of the 87 EI providers enrolled from 9 agencies in 4 counties across Washington State, 66 were included in the current sample. A stepped-wedge design was used to randomly assign counties to the timing of RIT training workshops. Self-report measures of practice and self-efficacy regarding ASD care were collected at baseline (T1, T2) and 6-months and 12-months post-training (T3, T4). At T3 and T4, providers reported on RIT adoption and rated items about RIT feasibility and perceived RIT effectiveness; at T4, they also reported on child characteristics that led to RIT use and modifications. From pre-training to post-training, there were significant increases in providers' self-efficacy in providing services to children with ASD or suspected ASD. At T3 and T4, provider ratings indicated high levels of RIT adoption, feasibility, and perceived RIT effectiveness. At T4, providers indicated that they most commonly: (a) initiated RIT when there were social-communication or motor imitation delays, or an ASD diagnosis; and (b) made modifications to RIT by repeating elements, blending it with other therapies, and loosening its structure. While additional research is needed, RIT may help families get an early start on accessing specialized treatment within an established infrastructure available across the United States. LAY SUMMARY: Reciprocal imitation training (RIT) is an evidence-based treatment for ASD that might be a good fit for use by intervention providers in widely accessible community-based settings. After attending an educational workshop on RIT, providers reported feeling more comfortable providing services to families with ASD concerns, used RIT with over 400 families, and believed that RIT improved important social communication behaviors.","Ibañez Lisa V, Scott Sabine, Stone Wendy L","Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research","Autism Spectrum Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Early Intervention, Educational, Humans, Imitative Behavior, Social Behavior","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34080761","Department of Psychology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.",

However, a link between oxytocin and trust in humans was discovered only in one early study. We hypothesized that there is a large interindividual variation in oxytocin sensitivity, and that such variation is one reason for the doubt surrounding the role of oxytocin in trusting behavior. Here, in a double-blind, prospective, case-control study, we administered intranasal oxytocin to participants of trust and risk games. We measured salivary oxytocin concentration, relating it to the amount of money transferred among participants (a proxy for trust) and the autism-spectrum quotient (AQ). A one-sided Fisher's exact test was performed to detect differences between the oxytocin and placebo groups in the proportions of investors who transferred the maximum amount of money. We discovered a tendency for participants who received oxytocin to transfer higher amounts of money to co-participants than those who received a placebo (<i>P</i> = 0.04). We also revealed a high degree of interindividual variation in salivary oxytocin concentrations after oxytocin administration. After stratifying the samples with respect to oxytocin sensitivity, oxytocin-sensitive participants in the oxytocin group also transferred higher amounts of money than those in the placebo group (<i>P</i> = 0.03), while such a tendency was not observed for oxytocin-insensitive participants (<i>P</i> = 0.34). Participants with lower AQ scores (less severe autistic traits) exhibited a greater tendency toward trusting behavior after oxytocin administration than did those with higher AQ scores (<i>P</i> = 0.02). A two-sample <i>t</i>-test that was performed to detect significant differences in the mean transfers between the oxytocin and placebo groups indicated no significant between-group difference in the mean transfers (<i>P</i> = 0.08). There are two possible interpretations of these results: First, there is no effect of oxytocin on trust in humans; second, the effects of oxytocin on trust in humans is person-dependent. However, the results should be interpreted with caution as the effect size was not larger than the minimal detectable effect size and the results were not statistically significant (<i>P</i> > 0.05) after Bonferroni corrections.","Kurokawa Hirofumi, Kinari Yusuke, Okudaira Hiroko, Tsubouchi Kiyotaka, Sai Yoshimichi, Kikuchi Mitsuru, Higashida Haruhiro, Ohtake Fumio","Frontiers in neuroscience",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34113232","Hirao School of Management, Konan University, Nishinomiya, Japan.; Department of Psychiatry and Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.; Research Center for Child Mental Development, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.; Center for Infectious Disease Education and Research, Osaka University, Suita, Japan.; Department of Hospital Pharmacy, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.; School of Economics and Management, University of Hyogo, Kobe, Japan.; Doshisha Business School, Doshisha University, Kyoto, Japan.",

Nevertheless, no studies have used multichannel transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over bilateral TPJ to estimate the effects on these neuropsychological functions. The project STIPED is using optimized multichannel stimulation as an innovative treatment approach for chronic pediatric neurodevelopmental disorders, namely in children/adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In this pilot study, we aim to explore whether anodal multichannel tDCS coupled with a Joint Attention Task (JAT) influences social-cognitive task performance relative to sham stimulation, both in an Emotion Recognition Task (ERT) and in a Mooney Faces Detection Task (MFDT), as well as to evaluate this technique's safety and tolerability. Twenty healthy adults were enrolled in a randomized, single-blinded, sham-controlled, crossover study. During two sessions, participants completed the ERT and the MFDT before and after 20min of sham or anodal tDCS over bilateral TPJ. No significant differences on performance accuracy and reaction time were found between stimulation conditions for all tasks, including the JAT. A significant main time effect for overall accuracy and reaction time was found for the MFDT. Itching was the most common side effect and stimulation conditions detection was at chance level. Results suggest that multichannel tDCS over bilateral TPJ does not affect performance of low-level emotional recognition tasks in healthy adults. Although preliminary safety and tolerability are demonstrated, further studies over longer periods will be pursued to investigate the clinical efficacy in children/adolescents with ASD, where social cognition impairments are preponderant.","Pereira H Catarina, Sousa Daniela, Simões Marco, Martins Ricardo, Amaral Carlos, Lopes Vânia, Crisóstomo Joana, Castelo-Branco Miguel","Progress in brain research","Adolescent, Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Cognition, Cross-Over Studies, Healthy Volunteers, Humans, Pilot Projects, Prefrontal Cortex, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34167659","Coimbra Institute for Biomedical Imaging and Translational Research (CIBIT), University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal; Institute for Nuclear Sciences Applied to Health (ICNAS), University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.; Coimbra Institute for Biomedical Imaging and Translational Research (CIBIT), University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal; Institute for Nuclear Sciences Applied to Health (ICNAS), University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal; Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal; Centre for Informatics and Systems, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.; Coimbra Institute for Biomedical Imaging and Translational Research (CIBIT), University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal; Institute for Nuclear Sciences Applied to Health (ICNAS), University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal; Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.

The objective of this study was to determine the association among rescue medication use, Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS), and perceived comfort by the nurses and caregivers. This was a pre-planned secondary analysis of a double-blind, randomized clinical trial comparing the use of a single dose of lorazepam plus haloperidol versus placebo plus haloperidol in patients with agitated delirium. Rescue medications were considered the gold standard for this analysis. The optimal cutoff for RASS analysis was calculated by using general linear regression models and determining the area of the curve and using the top left approach. We used 2 × 2 tables to examine the association between rescue medication use and perceived comfort. Fifty-eight patients received the study medications and 52 (89%) completed the 8-h observation period. There were 26 (50%) patients in each arm. The lorazepam/haloperidol arm required fewer rescue doses (4/26 (15%)) vs. 16/26 (62%), p = 0.004). Patients with a greater initial RASS reduction required fewer rescue doses. The cutoff value for RASS improvement was 4 points, area under the curve (AUC) 0.64 (95% CI 0.49-0.79) for those who required no rescue doses, and 3 points, AUC 0.74 (95% CI 0.52-0.96) for those who required more than one rescue dose. Rescue medication use was responsive to change and associated with both RASS scores and perceived patient comfort by the nurse and caregiver.","Tang Michael, Chen Minxing, Bruera Eduardo, Hui David","Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer","Antipsychotic Agents, Delirium, Double-Blind Method, Haloperidol, Humans, Lorazepam, Psychomotor Agitation","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34184130","Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.; Department of Palliative, Rehabilitation and Integrative Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 1414, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.; Department of Palliative, Rehabilitation and Integrative Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 1414, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.

To expand intervention options, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of potential treatment targets, and their engagement, in the brain. For instance, the striatum (caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens) plays a central role during development and its (atypical) functional connectivity (FC) may contribute to multiple ASD symptoms. We have previously shown, in the adult autistic and neurotypical brain, the non-intoxicating cannabinoid cannabidivarin (CBDV) alters the balance of striatal 'excitatory-inhibitory' metabolites, which help regulate FC, but the effects of CBDV on (atypical) striatal FC are unknown. To examine this in a small pilot study, we acquired resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 28 men (15 neurotypicals, 13 ASD) on two occasions in a repeated-measures, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. We then used a seed-based approach to (1) compare striatal FC between groups and (2) examine the effect of pharmacological probing (600 mg CBDV/matched placebo) on atypical striatal FC in ASD. Visits were separated by at least 13 days to allow for drug washout. Compared to the neurotypicals, ASD individuals had lower FC between the ventral striatum and frontal and pericentral regions (which have been associated with emotion, motor, and vision processing). Further, they had higher intra-striatal FC and higher putamenal FC with temporal regions involved in speech and language. In ASD, CBDV reduced hyperconnectivity to the neurotypical level. Our findings should be considered in light of several methodological aspects, in particular our participant group (restricted to male adults), which limits the generalizability of our findings to the wider and heterogeneous ASD population. In conclusion, here we show atypical striatal FC with regions commonly associated with ASD symptoms. We further provide preliminary proof of concept that, in the adult autistic brain, acute CBDV administration can modulate atypical striatal circuitry towards neurotypical function. Future studies are required to determine whether modulation of striatal FC is associated with a change in ASD symptoms. clinicaltrials.gov, Identifier: NCT03537950.

Medications are often needed to reduce agitation, but it is unclear what the desired level of sedation is. This study assessed personalized sedation goals (PSGs) and their predictors for patients in a delirium clinical trial and in clinical vignettes. This was a preplanned secondary analysis of a double-blind randomized clinical trial examining the sedative effect of chlorpromazine and/or haloperidol in patients with agitated delirium. At the baseline, caregivers and nurses were independently asked to select the PSG for the trial patient from 5 choices corresponding to Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) scores of 0 or higher (no sedation), -1 to -2, -3, -4, and -5 (deep sedation). Respondents also selected a PSG for 6 vignettes that differed by the level of agitation, ability to communicate, and survival. Forty-two caregivers and 39 nurses answered questions regarding PSGs. For the trial patient, caregivers preferred RASS scores of -1 to -2 most often (36%), whereas nurses preferred an RASS score of -3 most often (51 %). Caregivers were significantly more likely than nurses to choose lighter sedation (odds ratio [OR], 4.8; P = .01) despite reporting greater delirium-related distress (P = .0006). Patients were undersedated 33% to 53% of the time and oversedated 0% to 15% of the time according to the PSG response criteria. In the case vignettes, deeper sedation was preferred by nurses (P < .0001) and for patients who were unable to communicate (OR, 3.1-4.4; P < .0001) and had a shorter life expectancy (OR, 1.7; P = .002). Caregivers often preferred lighter sedation than nurses. Many patients were undersedated in comparison with caregivers' PSGs, and this highlights room for improvement. In the last days of life, many patients with cancer develop delirium and become restless/agitated; this can be highly distressing. Caregivers and physicians alike are often concerned about the use of sedatives for agitated delirium and try to find a balance between maximizing comfort and maintaining communication. This study examined the concept of a personalized sedation goal for setting an individualized target for the level of sedation. Caregivers often preferred lighter sedation than nurses.

Results were used to compare medications to cannabis as a proposed treatment. <b>Results:</b> The heterogeneity of ASD produces great difficulties in finding appropriate treatment, leading to many medication changes or treatment trials throughout a patient's life. Commonly prescribed medications display varying levels of efficacy, safety, and tolerability between patients and symptoms targeted. Some of the most common side effects cited are also considered the most troubling symptoms associated with ASD; aggression, anxiety, irritability, and a negative effect on cognition, leading many patients to discontinue use as the side effects outweigh benefits. Recent case reports and retrospective studies have displayed the potential efficacy, safety, and tolerability of cannabidiol (CBD)-rich medical cannabis use for treating both core symptoms of ASD and many comorbid symptoms such as irritability and sleep problems. Studies have also identified circulating endocannabinoids as a possible biomarker for ASD, providing another possible method of diagnosis. <b>Conclusions:</b> Currently, there are no approved medications for the core symptoms of ASD and only two medications Food and Drug Administration approved for associated irritability. Prescribed medications for symptoms associated with ASD display varying levels of efficacy, safety, and tolerability among the heterogeneous ASD population. At the time of this study there are no published placebo-controlled trials of medical cannabis for ASD and the observational studies have limitations. CBD-rich medical cannabis seems to be an effective, tolerable, and relatively safe option for many symptoms associated with ASD, however, the long-term safety is unknown at this time.","Holdman Richard, Vigil Daniel, Robinson Kelsey, Shah Puja, Contreras Alexandra Elyse","Cannabis and cannabinoid research","Autism Spectrum Disorder, Cannabidiol, Cannabis, Hallucinogens, Humans, Medical Marijuana, Retrospective Studies, United States","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34432543","Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, Marijuana Health Monitoring and Research, Denver, Colorado, USA.",

Participants included 68 children with diagnoses of autism (ages 6-13 years), and their parents, who were randomized to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or enhanced standard community treatment (ESCT) addressing autism-related symptoms. At pretreatment, parents described their child's top autism-related problems (YTPs) in their own words and rated the severity of these problems on a Likert-type scale. Parents also made daily severity ratings on the child's top three YTPs for 5 days prior to treatment and 5 days following treatment while videorecording their child's behavior at home on each of these days. Trained observers coded these videorecordings, focusing on the same YTPs that the parents rated. Parents also completed standardized checklists of autism-related symptoms and general mental health symptoms. There was evidence of convergent and discriminant validity as well as good test-retest reliability for the YTP measures. YTP severity scores converged with the standardized measure of autism-related symptoms. Parent-reported YTP scores predicted observers' YTP scores at the daily level, and both parent-reported and observers' YTP scores decreased from pre- to post treatment. Observers' ratings of the videorecordings exhibited sensitivity to treatment condition. These applications of the YTP method are promising and may complement standardized symptom checklists for clinical trials focusing on autism-related symptoms.

Previous trials have indicated the potential of arbaclofen for improving social function among autistic children and adolescents with fluent speech. The AIMS2TRIALS-Clinical Trial 1 (AIMS-CT1) will examine whether arbaclofen is superior to placebo in improving social function and other secondary outcomes over 16 weeks, along with safety and tolerability profiles. <b>Methods:</b> AIMS-CT1 is an international, multi-site, double-blind, parallel group Phase II randomized clinical trial. It will include 130 males and females aged 5:0-17:11 years, with a diagnosis of ASD and fluent speech. Eligible participants will be randomized on a ratio of 1:1 for a 16-week treatment period. Medication will be titrated over 5 weeks. The primary outcome is the effect on social function from weeks 0 to 16 measured on the Socialization domain of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, 3rd edition<sup>TM</sup>. Secondary outcome measures include the CGI-S (Clinical Global Impression-Severity), CGI-I (Clinical Global Impression-Improvement), other areas of adaptive function, social communication and other autism symptoms, co-occurring behavior problems and health-related quality of life. Genetic and electrophysiological markers will be examined as potential stratifiers for treatment response. Exploratory novel digital technologies will also be used to measure change, examining simultaneously the validity of digital biomarkers in natural environments. The safety and tolerability of the drug will also be examined. Our protocol is very closely aligned with a parallel Canadian trial of 90 participants (ARBA Study, US NCT number: NCT03887676) to allow for secondary combined analyses. Outcomes will be compared using both an Intent-to-reat and Per Protocol approach. <b>Discussion:</b> The outcomes of this trial, combined with the parallel Canadian trial, will contribute to the evidence base for medications used to help social difficulties among young autistic individuals; demonstrate the capabilities of the AIMS-2-TRIALS network of academic centers to deliver clinical trials; and support future drug development. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> EudraCT number: 2018-000942-21 and ClinicalTrials.gov registry number: NCT03682978.

We recently reported beneficial effects on repetitive behavioral symptoms that might be related to regulating excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance in the brain. Here, we tested the neurophysiological effects of bumetanide and the relationship to clinical outcome variability and investigated the potential for machine learning-based predictions of meaningful clinical improvement. Using modified linear mixed models applied to intention-to-treat population, we analyzed E/I-sensitive electroencephalography (EEG) measures before and after 91 days of treatment in the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Bumetanide in Autism Medication and Biomarker study. Resting-state EEG of 82 subjects out of 92 participants (7-15 years) were available. Alpha frequency band absolute and relative power, central frequency, long-range temporal correlations, and functional E/I ratio treatment effects were related to the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) and the Social Responsiveness Scale 2 as clinical outcomes. We observed superior bumetanide effects on EEG, reflected in increased absolute and relative alpha power and functional E/I ratio and in decreased central frequency. Associations between EEG and clinical outcome change were restricted to subgroups with medium to high RBS-R improvement. Using machine learning, medium and high RBS-R improvement could be predicted by baseline RBS-R score and EEG measures with 80% and 92% accuracy, respectively.

"34527087",,"Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder or Acute Stress Disorder: A Health Technology Assessment.","2021-01-01","Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and acute stress disorder (ASD) are mental health conditions that may emerge following a frightening or traumatic event in a person's life. We conducted a health technology assessment of internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) for adults with PTSD or ASD, which included an evaluation of effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness, the budget impact of publicly funding iCBT for PTSD or ADS, and patient preferences and values. We performed a systematic literature search of the clinical evidence. We assessed the risk of bias of systematic reviews using ROBIS and of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, and the quality of the body of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria.We performed a systematic economic literature search to summarize the economic evidence on the cost-effectiveness of iCBT for adults with PTSD or ASD. We did not conduct a primary economic evaluation on iCBT for adults with PTSD, as an existing cost-utility analysis is directly applicable to this research question. We did not conduct a primary economic evaluation on iCBT for adults with ASD, as there is limited clinical evidence on this topic and because evidence on iCBT for PTSD may be generalizable to iCBT for ASD at risk of progressing to PTSD. We analyzed the budget impact of publicly funding iCBT for adults with PTSD or ASD in Ontario over the next 5 years.To contextualize the potential value of iCBT for PTSD, we reviewed relevant literature on patients' preferences and values and spoke with people who have lived experience with PTSD to explore their values, needs, and priorities. We identified no studies on the use of iCBT for prevention of PTSD or studies on the use of iCBT to treat ASD, nor studies that directly compared iCBT with face-to-face CBT for the treatment of PTSD. We included one systematic review of the use of iCBT to treat PTSD (10 RCTs, N = 720). Overall, iCBT is more effective than wait-list (waiting for iCBT) or usual care alone for reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.60 [95% CI -0.97 to -0.24]; N = 560, 8 RCTs) (GRADE: Very low). Internet-delivered CBT is not more effective than non-CBT internet-delivered interventions for reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms (SMD = -0.08 [-0.52 to 0.35]; N = 82, 2 RCTs) (GRADE: Very low).We identified one economic evaluation on the cost-effectiveness of iCBT for adults with PTSD. For adults with PTSD, iCBT was found to be dominant (i.e., less costly and more effective) compared with usual care. The model used a Canadian public health care payer perspective, and there were no major limitations to the model structure, time horizon, or source of model inputs. The annual budget impact of publicly funding iCBT in Ontario over the next 5 years ranges from an additional $2.43 million in year 1 to $2.37 million in year 5, for a total additional cost of $16.53 million over the next 5 years. If treatment costs alone are considered, the annual budget impact ranges from an additional $3.37 million in year 1 to $17.84 million in year 5, for a total additional cost of $52.61 million over the next 5 years.Our review of the quantitative literature on patient preferences found that adults with PTSD may experience iCBT as a generally acceptable form of treatment, but there is uncertainty in the evidence due to incomplete follow-up in studies and variability in the nature and extent of the therapist-patient relationship. The 10 people we spoke with had all been diagnosed with PTSD. They reported on its negative impact on their quality of life, including difficulty in managing everyday activities, relationships, and employment. Participants viewed iCBT as beneficial to managing their PTSD symptoms but stressed the importance of combining it with face-to-face CBT. However, wait times for PTSD services are long, and out-of-pocket expenses could be a barrier for people without private insurance. Internet-delivered CBT may reduce the severity of PTSD symptoms compared with wait-list or usual care, but the evidence is very uncertain, and iCBT may have little to no effect on improving PTSD symptoms compared with non-CBT interventions delivered online, but here as well the evidence is very uncertain.For adults with PTSD, iCBT may be cost-effective compared with usual care. We estimate that publicly funding iCBT in Ontario would result in additional costs of between $2.37 million and $2.43 million per year over the next 5 years.People with PTSD seem to generally find iCBT as an acceptable treatment option. People with PTSD with whom we spoke viewed iCBT to be effective and recommended it be combined with in-person psychotherapy."," ","Ontario health technology assessment series","Adult, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Humans, Internet, Ontario, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic, Stress Disorders, Traumatic, Acute, Systematic Reviews as Topic, Technology Assessment, Biomedical","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34527087",,

In particular, while numerous studies have demonstrated effects of oxytocin in promoting social attention the role of AVP has not been examined. The present study employed a randomized, double-blind, placebo (PLC)-controlled between-subject design to explore the social- and emotion-specific effects of AVP on both bottom-up and top-down attention processing with a validated emotional anti-saccade eye-tracking paradigm in 80 healthy male subjects (PLC = 40, AVP = 40). Our findings showed that AVP increased the error rate for social (angry, fearful, happy, neutral and sad faces) but not non-social (oval shapes) stimuli during the anti-saccade condition and reduced error rates in the pro-saccade condition. Comparison of these findings with a previous study (sample size: PLC = 33, OXT = 33) using intranasal oxytocin revealed similar effects of the two peptides on anti-saccade errors, although with some difference in effects of specific face emotions, but a significantly greater effect of AVP on pro-saccades. Both peptides also produced a post-task anxiolytic effect by reducing state anxiety. Together these findings suggested that both AVP and OXT decrease goal-directed top-down attention control to social salient stimuli but that AVP more potently increased bottom-up social attentional processing.","Zhuang Qian, Zheng Xiaoxiao, Becker Benjamin, Lei Wei, Xu Xiaolei, Kendrick Keith M","Psychoneuroendocrinology","Administration, Intranasal, Arginine Vasopressin, Attention, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Humans, Male, Oxytocin","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34537624","The Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, MOE Key Laboratory for Neuroinformation, Center for Information in Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, No. 2006, Xiyuan Ave., West Hi-Tech Zone, Chengdu 611761, Sichuan, China.

Monogenic causes of ASD such as PMS are well suited to investigations with novel therapeutics, as interventions can be targeted based on established genetic etiology. While preclinical studies have demonstrated that the neuropeptide oxytocin can reverse electrophysiological, attentional, and social recognition memory deficits in Shank3-deficient rats, there have been no trials in individuals with PMS. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of intranasal oxytocin as a treatment for the core symptoms of ASD in a cohort of children with PMS. Eighteen children aged 5-17 with PMS were enrolled. Participants were randomized to receive intranasal oxytocin or placebo (intranasal saline) and underwent treatment during a 12-week double-blind, parallel group phase, followed by a 12-week open-label extension phase during which all participants received oxytocin. Efficacy was assessed using the primary outcome of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Social Withdrawal (ABC-SW) subscale as well as a number of secondary outcome measures related to the core symptoms of ASD. Safety was monitored throughout the study period. There was no statistically significant improvement with oxytocin as compared to placebo on the ABC-SW (Mann-Whitney U = 50, p = 0.055), or on any secondary outcome measures, during either the double-blind or open-label phases. Oxytocin was generally well tolerated, and there were no serious adverse events. The small sample size, potential challenges with drug administration, and expectancy bias due to relying on parent reported outcome measures may all contribute to limitations in interpreting results.

To assess whether behavioral interventions in children and adolescents with neurodevelopmental or mental health disorders are associated with improvements in social function and social cognition, and whether patient, intervention, and methodological characteristics moderate the association. For this systematic review and meta-analysis, the PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and PubMed electronic databases were searched in December 2020 for randomized clinical trials published from database inception to December 1, 2020, including terms related to neurodevelopmental or mental health disorders, social behavior, randomized clinical trials, and children and adolescents. Data were analyzed in January 2021. Randomized clinical trials that enrolled participants aged 4 to 17 years with social deficits and examined the efficacy of a clinician-administered behavioral intervention targeting social functioning or social cognition were included. A total of 9314 records were identified, 78 full texts were assessed for eligibility, and 33 articles were included in the study; 31 of these reported social function outcomes and 12 reported social cognition outcomes. Articles were reviewed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment for randomized clinical trials. Data were independently extracted and pooled using a weighted random-effects model. The main outcome was the association of behavioral intervention with social function and social cognition. Hedges g was used to measure the standardized mean difference between intervention and control groups. Standardized effect sizes were calculated for the intervention group vs the comparison group for each trial. A total of 31 trials including 2131 participants (1711 [80%] male; 420 [20%] female; mean [SD] age, 10.8 [2.2] years) with neurodevelopmental or mental health disorders (autism spectrum disorder [ASD] [n = 23], attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [n = 4], other conditions associated with social deficits [n = 4]) were analyzed to examine differences in social function between the intervention and control groups. Significantly greater gains in social function were found among participants who received an intervention than among the control groups (Hedges g, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.40-0.83; P < .001). The type of control condition (wait list vs active control vs treatment as usual) was a significant moderator of effect size (Q2, 7.11; P = .03). Twelve studies including 487 individuals with ASD (48 [10%] female; 439 [90%] male; mean [SD] age, 10.4 [1.7] years) were analyzed to examine differences in social cognition between intervention and control groups. The overall mean weighted effect was significant (Hedges g, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.39-0.96; P < .001), indicating the treatment groups had better performance on social cognitive tasks.

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) and Tomatis sound therapy (TST) in an Egyptian cohort of children with ASD. This study was a prospective, open label, randomized interventional clinical trial. One hundred forty-six children with ASD with no previous rehabilitation therapy were enrolled in our study. Patients were randomly divided into four groups: the first group received hyperbaric oxygen therapy, the second group received Tomatis sound therapy, the third group received a combination of both modalities, and the fourth group, the control group, received no intervention. We found that the combination of Tomatis sound therapy with hyperbaric oxygen therapy had a superior effect in improving autism symptoms than each intervention alone (CARS after therapy 35.04 ± 13.38 versus 49.34 ± 17.54 before the intervention, p < 0.001). The combination of both modalities may be helpful for children with ASD. The most distinctive evidence that supports the use of combination therapy for ASD is still controversial; however, our study provides some evidence of the benefit of combination therapy for children with ASD. Future studies should use a more sophisticated research design and begin by finding a consistent baseline measure that can be used to evaluate the effects of these therapies for ASD.","El-Tellawy Mohamed M, Ahmad Ahmad Roshdy, Saad Khaled, Alruwaili Thamer A M, AbdelMoneim Inas M, Shaaban Islam, Alinad Ahmed Khalid M, Albulayhid Saqer Bulayhid H, Khalaf Shaimaa M","Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry","Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Combined Modality Therapy, Egypt, Female, Humans, Hyperbaric Oxygenation, Male, Music Therapy, Prospective Studies, Psychotherapy, Group","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34662695","Departments of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Jouf University, Sakaka, Saudi Arabia; Departments of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.; Departments of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.; Department of Psychology, Speech, and Special Needs, Faculty of Arts, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.; College of Medicine, Jouf University, Sakaka, Saudi Arabia.; Departments of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt; Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Alrayan Colleges, Madinah, Saudi Arabia.

Interventions using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to enhance or inhibit cortical excitability are under study for various targets, though the mechanistic effects of rTMS have yet to be examined in ASD. Here, we examined whether an excitatory rTMS treatment course modulates glutamatergic (Glx) or γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) metabolite levels in emerging adults with ASD. Twenty-eight participants with ASD and executive function impairment [23.3 ± 4.69 years; seven-female] underwent two magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) scans of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). MRS scans were acquired before and after participants with ASD were randomized to receive a 20-session course of active or sham rTMS to the DLPFC. Baseline MRS data was available for 19 typically developing controls [23.8 ± 4.47 years; six-female]. Metabolite levels for Glx and GABA+ were compared between ASD and control groups, at baseline, and metabolite level change, pre-to-post-rTMS treatment, was compared in ASD participants that underwent active vs. sham rTMS. Absolute change in Glx was greater in the active vs. sham-rTMS group [<i>F</i> <sub>(1,</sub> <sub>19)</sub> = 6.54, <i>p</i> = 0.02], though the absolute change in GABA+ did not differ between groups. We also examined how baseline metabolite levels related to pre/post-rTMS metabolite level change, in the active vs. sham groups. rTMS group moderated the relation between baseline Glx and pre-to-post-rTMS Glx change, such that baseline Glx predicted Glx change in the active-rTMS group only [<i>b</i> = 1.52, <i>SE</i> = 0.32, <i>t</i> <sub>(18)</sub> = 4.74, <i>p</i> < 0.001]; Glx levels increased when baseline levels were lower, and decreased when baseline levels were higher. Our results indicate that an interventional course of excitatory rTMS to the DLPFC may modulate local Glx levels in emerging adults with ASD, and align with prior reports of glutamatergic alterations following rTMS. Interventional studies that track glutamatergic markers may provide mechanistic insights into the therapeutic potential of rTMS in ASD. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> Clinicaltrials.gov (ID: NCT02311751), https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02311751?term=ameis&rank=1; NCT02311751.","Moxon-Emre Iska, Daskalakis Zafiris J, Blumberger Daniel M, Croarkin Paul E, Lyon Rachael E, Forde Natalie J, Tani Hideaki, Truong Peter, Lai Meng-Chuan, Desarkar Pushpal, Sailasuta Napapon, Szatmari Peter, Ameis Stephanie H","Frontiers in neuroscience",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34690671","Research Imaging Centre, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry and Psychology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.; Cundill Centre for Child and Youth Depression, The Margaret and Wallace McCain Centre for Child, Youth & Family Mental Health, Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Temerty Centre for Therapeutic Brain Intervention, Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada.",
"34693989","10.1002/14651858.Cd013173.Pub2","Behavioural and cognitive behavioural therapy for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).","2021-09-03","Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) is an increasingly recognised neurodevelopmental condition; that is, a neurologically-based condition which interferes with the acquisition, retention or application of specific skills. ASD is characterised by challenges with socialisation and communication, and by stereotyped and repetitive behaviours. A stereotyped behaviour is one which is repeated over and over again and which seems not to have any useful function. ASD often co-occurs with mental health disorders, including obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). People with ASD may show certain cognitive differences (i.e. differences in ways of thinking) which influence their response to therapies. Thus, there is a need for evidence-based guidelines to treat mental health issues in this group. OCD, a common condition characterised by repeated obsessional thoughts and compulsive acts, occurs with greater frequency in persons with ASD than in the general population. Genetic, anatomic, neurobiological and psychological factors have been proposed to explain this co-occurrence. However, care should be taken to distinguish stereotyped and repetitive behaviours characteristic of ASD from obsessive compulsive acts in OCD. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the recommended treatment for OCD, but studies have suggested that this treatment may be less effective in those with OCD co-occurring with ASD. Hence, modifications to CBT treatment may be helpful when treating OCD co-occurring with ASD to optimise outcomes. To assess the effectiveness of behavioural and cognitive behavioural therapy for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in children and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We searched for studies in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, five other bibliographic databases, international trial registries and other sources of grey literature (to 24 August 2020). We checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews to identify additional studies missed from the original electronic searches. We contacted subject experts for further information when needed. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cross-over, cluster- and quasi-randomised controlled trials involving both adults and children with diagnoses of OCD and ASD. We included studies of participants with co-occurring conditions (i.e. those experiencing other mental illnesses or neurodevelopmental conditions at the same time), but we did not include individuals who had a co-occurring global learning difficulty. Treatment could be in any setting or format and include behavioural therapy (BT) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which may have been adapted for those with ASD. Comparator interventions included no treatment, waiting list, attention placebo (where the control group receives non-specific aspects of therapy, but not the active ingredient) and treatment as usual (TAU, where the control group receives the usual treatment, according to accepted standards). Three review authors independently screened studies for inclusion. The authors extracted relevant data from the one eligible study, assessed the risk of bias and certainty of evidence (GRADE). Outcomes of interest were changes in OCD symptoms and treatment completion (primary outcome), and severity of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and behavioural difficulties, as well as degree of family accommodation (secondary outcomes). We did not conduct meta-analyses as only one study met the selection criteria. We included only one RCT of 46 participants in our analysis. This study compared CBT for OCD in persons with high-functioning ASD with a control group who received anxiety management only. There were no differences in rates of treatment completion between the CBT (87%) and anxiety management (87%) groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.25; low-certainty evidence). Behavioural difficulties were not included as an outcome measure in the study. This study showed that there may be a benefit at the end of treatment favouring CBT compared with anxiety management in OCD symptoms (mean difference (MD) -3.00, 95% CI -8.02 to 2.02), depression symptoms (MD -1.80, 95% CI -11.50 to 7.90), anxiety symptoms (MD -3.20, 95% CI -11.38 to 4.98), and quality of life (MD 5.20, 95% CI -1.41 to 11.81), but the evidence was of low certainty.  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence is limited regarding the efficacy of CBT for treatment of OCD in ASD. There is much scope for future study, not only examining the efficacy of CBT for OCD in ASD, but also the particular ways that OCD manifests in and affects people with ASD and the role of the family in treatment response.","Elliott Sarah J, Marshall David, Morley Karen, Uphoff Eleonora, Kumar Mrityunjai, Meader Nicholas","The Cochrane database of systematic reviews","Adult, Anxiety, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Child, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Humans, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34693989","Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, University of York, York, UK.; Wigan Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service, Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust, Wigan, UK.; Elm House, East Cheshire Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service, Cheshire and Wirral Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, Macclesfield, UK.; Cochrane Consumer Network, York, UK.",

This double-blind noninferiority prospective study with a noninferiority margin of 10% compared propranolol with nadolol in infants aged 1 to 6 months with problematic IH. The study was conducted in 2 academic pediatric dermatology centers in Canada between 2016 and 2020.

Of these, 36 were treated with propranolol. The mean (SD) age in this group was 3.1 (1.4) months, and 31 individuals (86%) were female. Thirty-five infants were treated with nadolol. The mean (SD) age in this group was 3.2 (1.6) months, and 26 individuals (74%) were female. The difference in IH between groups by t test was 8.8 (95% CI, 2.7-14.9) for size and 17.1 (95% CI, 7.2-30.0) for color in favor of the nadolol group, demonstrating that nadolol was noninferior to propranolol. Similar differences were noted at 52 weeks: 6.0 (95% CI, 1.9-10.1) and 10.1 (95% CI, 2.9-17.4) for size and color improvement, respectively. For each doubling of time unit (week), the coefficient of involution was 2.4 (95% CI, 0.5-4.4) higher with nadolol compared with propranolol. Safety data were similar between the 2 interventions. Oral nadolol was noninferior to oral propranolol, indicating it may be an efficacious and safe alternative in cases of propranolol unresponsiveness or adverse events, or when faster involution is required.

However, the evidence to date has been indirect, arising from correlational studies in patients and preclinical models. Here, we evaluated the role of GABA receptor directly, in 44 adults (<i>n</i> = 19 ASD). Baseline concentration of occipital lobe GABA+ (GABA plus coedited macromolecules) was measured using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS). Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) elicited by a passive visual surround suppression paradigm was compared after double-blind randomized oral administration of placebo or 15 to 30 mg of arbaclofen (STX209), a GABA type B (GABA<sub>B</sub>) receptor agonist. In the placebo condition, the neurotypical SSVEP response was affected by both the foreground stimuli contrast and background interference (suppression). In ASD, however, all stimuli conditions had equal salience and background suppression of the foreground response was weaker. In the placebo condition, although there was no difference in GABA+ between groups, GABA+ concentration positively correlated with response to maximum foreground contrast during maximum background interference in neurotypicals, but not ASD. In neurotypicals, sensitivity to visual stimuli was disrupted by 30 mg of arbaclofen, whereas in ASD, it was made more “typical” and visual processing differences were abolished. Hence, differences in GABAergic function are fundamental to autistic (visual) sensory neurobiology and are modulated by GABA<sub>B</sub> activity.","Huang Qiyun, Pereira Andreia C, Velthuis Hester, Wong Nichol M L, Ellis Claire L, Ponteduro Francesca M, Dimitrov Mihail, Kowalewski Lukasz, Lythgoe David J, Rotaru Diana, Edden Richard A E, Leonard Alison, Ivin Glynis, Ahmad Jumana, Pretzsch Charlotte M, Daly Eileen, Murphy Declan G M, McAlonan Gráinne M","Science translational medicine","Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Evoked Potentials, Visual, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Receptors, GABA, Visual Perception, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34985973","School of Human Sciences, University of Greenwich, London SE10 9LS, UK.; Russell H.

The current double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, crossover trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03466671) was aimed to test the effect of TTA-121, a new formulation of intranasal oxytocin spray with an enhanced bioavailability (3.6 times higher than Syntocinon® spray, as assessed by area under the concentration-time curve in rabbit brains), which enabled us to test a wide range of multiple doses, on autism spectrum disorder core symptoms and to determine the dose-response relationship. Four-week administrations of TTA-121, at low dose once per day (3 U/day), low dose twice per day (6 U/day), high dose once per day (10 U/day), or high dose twice per day (20 U/day), and 4-week placebo were administered in a crossover manner. The primary outcome was the mean difference in the reciprocity score (range: 0-14, higher values represent worse outcomes) on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule between the baseline and end point of each administration period. This trial with two administration periods and eight groups was conducted at seven university hospitals in Japan, enrolling adult males with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder. Enrolment began from June 2018 and ended December 2019. Follow-up ended March 2020. Of 109 males with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder who were randomized, 103 completed the trial. The smallest P-value, judged as the dose-response relationship, was the contrast with the peak at TTA-121 6 U/day, with inverted U-shape for both the full analysis set (P = 0.182) and per protocol set (P = 0.073). The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule reciprocity score, the primary outcome, was reduced in the TTA-121 6 U/day administration period compared with the placebo (full analysis set: P = 0.118, mean difference = -0.5; 95% CI: -1.1 to 0.1; per protocol set: P = 0.012, mean difference = -0.8; 95% CI: -1.3 to -0.2). The per protocol set was the analysis target population, consisting of all full analysis set participants except those who deviated from the protocol. Most dropouts from the full analysis set to the per protocol set occurred because of poor adherence to the test drug (9 of 12 in the first period and 8 of 15 in the second period). None of the secondary clinical and behavioural outcomes were significantly improved with the TTA-121 compared with the placebo in the full analysis set. A novel intranasal spray of oxytocin with enhanced bioavailability enabled us to test a wide range of multiple doses, revealing an inverted U-shape dose-response curve, with the peak at a dose that was lower than expected from previous studies. The efficacy of TTA-121 shown in the current exploratory study should be verified in a future large-scale, parallel-group trial.","Yamasue Hidenori, Kojima Masaki, Kuwabara Hitoshi, Kuroda Miho, Matsumoto Kaori, Kanai Chieko, Inada Naoko, Owada Keiho, Ochi Keiko, Ono Nobutaka, Benner Seico, Wakuda Tomoyasu, Kameno Yosuke, Inoue Jun, Harada Taeko, Tsuchiya Kenji, Umemura Kazuo, Yamauchi Aya, Ogawa Nanayo, Kushima Itaru, Ozaki Norio, Suyama Satoshi, Saito Takuya, Uemura Yukari, Hamada Junko, Kano Yukiko, Honda Nami, Kikuchi Saya, Seto Moe, Tomita Hiroaki, Miyoshi Noriko, Matsumoto Megumi, Kawaguchi Yuko, Kanai Koji, Ikeda Manabu, Nakamura Itta, Isomura Shuichi, Hirano Yoji, Onitsuka Toshiaki, Kosaka Hirotaka, Okada Takashi","Brain : a journal of neurology","Administration, Intranasal, Animals, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Biological Availability, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Nasal Sprays, Oxytocin, Rabbits, Treatment Outcome","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35067719","Graduate School of Psychology, Kanazawa Institute of Technology, 7-1 Ohgigaoka, Nonoichi 921-8054, Japan.; School of Media Science, Tokyo University of Technology, Hachioji, Japan.; Child Development and Education, Faculty of Humanities, Wayo Women's University, Konodai 2-3-1, Ichikawa, Chiba 272-0827, Japan.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashiku, Hamamatsu City 431-3192, Japan.; Department of Psychiatry, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashiku, Hamamatsu City 431-3192, Japan.; Department of Psychiatry, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.; Department of Psychology, Faculty of Liberal Arts, Teikyo University, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Psychiatry, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, 65 Tsurumai-cho, Showa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi 466-8550, Japan.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.; Department of Medical Technique, Nagoya University Hospital, 65 Tsurumai-cho, Showa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi 466-8560, Japan.; Department of Pharmacology, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashiku, Hamamatsu City 431-3192, Japan.; Department of Psychiatry, Graduate School of Medicine, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.; Department of Child Development, United Graduate School of Child Development at Hamamatsu, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashiku, Hamamatsu 431-3192, Japan.; Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.; Department of Child Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.; Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.; Department of Computer Science, Graduate School of Systems Design, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Hino, Japan.; Biostatistics Section, Department of Data Science, Center for Clinical Science, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Shinjyu-ku, Tokyo 162-8655, Japan.; Department of Neuropsychiatry, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, Eiheiji, Fukui 910-1193, Japan.",

The corpus callosum has been linked to cognitive processing and callosal abnormalities have been previously found in people diagnosed with ASD.

We conducted tract-based spatial statistics and a region of interest analysis. The fractional anisotropy values (believed to indicate white matter integrity) in the posterior corpus callosum was significantly different across cases (exposed to parent-managed behavioral intervention) and controls (not exposed to parent-managed behavioral intervention). The effect was modulated by the intensity of the behavioral intervention according to a dose-response relationship. The current feasibility case-control study provides the basis for estimating the statistical power required for future RCTs in this field.

"35120753","10.1016/J.Encep.2021.08.005","[Therapeutic approaches for sleep and rhythms disorders in children with ASD].","2022-06-01","Sleep disturbances are extremely common (40-86%) in children and adolescents, especially those with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and are often among the first symptoms identified by parents at a very early stage of their child's development. These abnormalities are among the main parental concerns when having a child with ASD and have a significant impact on the quality of life of patients, their parents, and more broadly their siblings. Sleep disorders are essentially abnormalities of the sleep-wake rhythm - primarily sleep onset insomnia or nocturnal awakenings (with difficulty falling back to sleep). These disturbances can be accompanied by other sleep disorders, requiring notably a systematic elimination of the presence of a sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome - to ensure a personalized and efficient therapeutic approach. Physiologically, the determinants of these sleep disorders are poorly understood, even though several studies point to a significant decrease in melatonin synthesis in people with ASD. Melatonin is a hormone that facilitates falling asleep and maintaining sleep and is also involved in the endogenous synchronization of internal biological clocks. However, the causal factors of this decrease in melatonin synthesis are largely unknown, involving to a small extent the genes involved in melatonin synthesis pathway. The treatment of sleep disorders is relatively systematic: after eliminating other specific sleep disorders associated with the complaint of insomnia, as well as other possible associated comorbidities (such as seizures), a global and graduated therapeutic approach must be put in place. This treatment will be non-pharmacological as a first line, then pharmacological as a second line. A number of non-pharmacological treatment strategies for sleep disorders in typically developing children and adolescents, as well as those with ASD, have been shown to be effective. This treatment requires a combination of: 1) parental education to promote sleep development; 2) setting up bedtime rituals adapted to the child's age and particularities; 3) specific behavioral strategies including bedtime fading, gradual extinction and positive reinforcement of adapted behaviors. It is very essential that the parents are accompanied throughout this therapy. Sleep hygiene and behavioral care must also take into consideration the important role of the zeitgebers of sleep-wake rhythms, i.e. the external environmental factors involved in the synchronization of the biological clocks: regular exposure to light at adapted times, regular meal and wake-up times, social activities and times for going to school. The evidence for the effectiveness of behavioral interventions in the treatment of behavioral insomnia in the typical developmental child is strong, since 94% of children show clinically significant improvements in nighttime sleepiness and waking. By contrast, only about 25% of children with ASD are improved by an approach combining sleep hygiene and behavioral therapy. Melatonin has a special and prominent place in the drug management of sleep disorders associated with ASD. Several clinical trials have shown that melatonin is effective in treating sleep disorders in patients with ASD. This work led to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granting marketing authorization in September 2018 for a sustained-release paediatric melatonin molecule (Slenyto®). This synthetic molecule is a prolonged release melatonin (PRM) which mimics the physiological pharmacokinetic and secretory characteristics of endogenous melatonin, having a very short blood half-life and prolonged secretion for several hours during the night. A recent study evaluated the efficacy and safety of pediatric PRM (mini-tablets) in 125 children, aged 2 to 17.5 years with mainly ASD. After 15 days on placebo, the children were randomized into two parallel groups, PRM or placebo in a double-blind design for 13 weeks. At endpoint, total sleep time was increased by an average of 57.5 minutes on PRM and only 9.14 minutes on placebo (P=0.034). This difference between the two groups was already significant after three weeks of treatment (P=0.006). Sleep latency was also improved in the PRM group (-39.6 minutes) compared to placebo (-12.51 minutes) (P=0.01). Consolidated sleep duration (uninterrupted by awakenings) was improved by 77.9 minutes for the PRM group and only 25.4 minutes for the placebo group (P<0.001). PRM was well tolerated, the most frequent side effects being headache and daytime drowsiness at the same level with PRM or placebo. In addition, the acceptability by the children for swallowing the mini-tablets was excellent (100% compliance). The efficacy and tolerability of PRM was maintained over the medium and long term in the open phase, over a total study duration of 2 years.","Schröder C M, Broquère M A, Claustrat B, Delorme R, Franco P, Lecendreux M, Tordjman S","L'Encephale","Adolescent, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Humans, Melatonin, Quality of Life, Sleep, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders, Sleep Wake Disorders","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35120753","Centre pédiatrique des pathologies du sommeil, hôpital Robert-Debré, 75015 Paris, France; Centre de référence pour la narcolepsie et les hypersomnies idiopathiques et le syndrome de Kleine-Levin (CNR Narcolepsie-Hypersomnie), Paris, France.; Prosom (association nationale de promotion des connaissances du sommeil), 7, place du Griffon, 69001 Lyon, France.; Centre ressource autisme, hôpital La Grave Place Lange, 31300 Toulouse, France.; Service de psychiatrie de l'enfant et de l'adolescent, centre d'excellence pour l'autisme et les troubles du neurodeveloppement inovand, hôpital Robert-Debré, 75019 Paris, France; Génétique humaine et fonctions cognitives, institut Pasteur, 75015 Paris, France.; Service de psychiatrie de l'enfant et de l'adolescent, centre d'excellence pour l'autisme et les troubles du neurodéveloppement STRAS&ND, hôpitaux universitaires de Strasbourg, université de Strasbourg, 67000 Strasbourg, France; CNRS UPR 3212, institut des neurosciences cellulaires et intégratives, 67000 Strasbourg, France; Centre des troubles du sommeil, centre international de recherche en chronosomnologie (CIRCSom), hôpitaux universitaires de Strasbourg, 1, place de l'Hôpital, 67000 Strasbourg, France.

Trofinetide is a synthetic analog of glycine-proline-glutamate, the N-terminal tripeptide of insulin-like growth factor 1. In a phase 2, placebo-controlled trial in 82 females with RTT aged 5-15 years, a significant (p ≤ 0.042) improvement over placebo was observed with the highest trofinetide dose (200 mg/kg twice daily [BID]) on three measures: Rett Syndrome Behaviour Questionnaire (RSBQ), Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I), and RTT-Clinician Domain Specific Concerns-Visual Analog Scale (RTT-DSC-VAS). Trofinetide was well tolerated at all doses (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg BID). A phase 3 trial utilizing disease-specific and novel scales was designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of trofinetide in girls and women with RTT. This 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study (LAVENDER; NCT04181723) will evaluate trofinetide in 187 females, aged 5-20 years, with RTT. Co-primary endpoints are the RSBQ and CGI-I scales. Clinical domains of the CGI-I include communication, ambulation, hand use, seizures, attentiveness, and social (eye contact) and autonomic (breathing) aspects. Secondary endpoints will leverage four novel RTT-specific clinician ratings (derived from the RTT-DSC-VAS) of hand function, ambulation, ability to communicate, and verbal communication, and existing scales, to evaluate other core symptoms of RTT, quality of life and caregiver burden. A 40-week, open-label extension study will follow. This study was designed using disease-specific scales optimized to demonstrate changes in core symptoms of RTT and may provide the first phase 3 data demonstrating drug efficacy in individuals with RTT.

We aimed to assess the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of balovaptan, a vasopressin 1a receptor antagonist, versus placebo in autistic adults. V1aduct was a phase 3, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, conducted at 46 sites across six countries (the USA, the UK, France, Italy, Spain, and Canada). Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older with an intelligence quotient (IQ) of 70 or higher, and met the criteria for moderate-to-severe autism spectrum disorder (DSM-5 and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule). Participants were randomly allocated (1:1), with an independent interactive voice or web-based response system, to receive balovaptan (10 mg) or placebo daily for 24 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by an individual's baseline Vineland-II two-domain composite (2DC) score (<60 or ≥60), sex, region (North America or rest of world), and age (<25 years or ≥25 years). Participants, study site personnel, and the sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in Vineland-II 2DC score (the mean composite score across the Vineland-II socialisation and communication domains) at week 24. The primary analysis was done with ANCOVA in the intention-to-treat population. The V1aduct study was terminated for futility after around 50% of participants completed the week 24 visit. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03504917). Between Aug 8, 2018, and July 1, 2020, 540 people were screened for eligibility, of whom 322 were allocated to receive balovaptan (164 [51%]) or placebo (158 [49%]). One participant from the balovaptan group was not treated before trial termination and was excluded from the analysis. 60 participants in the balovaptan group and 55 in the placebo group discontinued treatment before week 24. The sample consisted of 64 (20%) women and 257 (80%) men, with 260 (81%) participants from North America and 61 (19%) from Europe. At baseline, mean age was 27·6 years (SD 9·7) and mean IQ score was 104·8 (18·1). Two (1%) participants were American Indian or Alaska Native, eight (2%) were Asian, 15 (5%) were Black or African American, 283 (88%) were White, four (1%) were of multiple races, and nine (3%) were of unknown race. Mean baseline Vineland-II 2DC scores were 67·2 (SD 15·3) in the balovaptan group and 66·2 (17·7) in the placebo group. The interim futility analysis showed no improvement for balovaptan versus placebo in terms of Vineland-II 2DC score at week 24 compared with baseline, with a least-squares mean change of 2·91 (SE 1·52) in the balovaptan group (n=79) and 4·75 (1·60) in the placebo group (n=71; estimated treatment difference -1·84 [95% CI -5·15 to 1·48]). In the final analysis, mean change from baseline in Vineland-II 2DC score at week 24 was 4·56 (SD 10·85) in the balovaptan group (n=111) and 6·83 (12·18) in the placebo group (n=99). Balovaptan was well tolerated, with similar proportions of participants with at least one adverse event in the balovaptan group (98 [60%] of 163) and placebo group (104 [66%] of 158). The most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis (14 [9%] in the balovaptan group and 19 [12%] in the placebo group), diarrhoea (11 [7%] and 14 [9%]), upper respiratory tract infection (ten [6%] and nine [6%]), insomnia (five [3%] and eight [5%]), oropharyngeal pain (five [3%] and eight [5%]), and dizziness (two [1%] and ten [6%]). Serious adverse events were reported for two (1%) participants in the balovaptan group (one each of suicidal ideation and schizoaffective disorder), and five (3%) participants in the placebo group (one each of suicidal ideation, panic disorder, limb abscess, urosepsis, colitis [in the same participant with urosepsis], and death by suicide). No treatment-related deaths occurred. Balovaptan did not improve social communication in autistic adults. This study provides insights into challenges facing autism spectrum disorder trials, including the considerable placebo response and the selection of appropriate outcome measures.

This two-armed, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial aimed to investigate the beneficial effects of tDCS combined with concurrent cognitive remediation training on adolescents and young adults with ASD. Participants were randomly assigned to either active or sham tDCS groups and received 1.5 mA prefrontal tDCS with left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) cathode placement and right supraorbital region anode placement for 20 minutes over two consecutive weeks. tDCS was delivered concurrently with a computerized cognitive remediation training program. Social functioning and its underlying cognitive processes, as well as prefrontal resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC), were measured. The results from 41 participants indicated that multisession prefrontal tDCS, compared to sham tDCS, significantly enhanced the social functioning of ASD individuals [F(1,39) = 4.75, p = .035, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.11]. This improvement was associated with enhanced emotion recognition [F(1,39) = 8.34, p = .006, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.18] and cognitive flexibility [F(1,39) = 4.91, p = .033, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.11]. Specifically, this tDCS protocol optimized information processing efficiency [F(1,39) = 4.43, p = .042, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.10], and the optimization showed a trend to be associated with enhanced rsFC in the right medial prefrontal cortex (ρ = 0.339, pFDR = .083). Multisession tDCS with left dlPFC cathode placement and right supraorbital region anode placement paired with concurrent cognitive remediation training promoted social functioning in individuals with ASD. This appeared to be associated with the enhancement of the functional connectivity of the right medial PFC, a major hub for flexible social information processing, allowing these individuals to process information more efficiently in response to different social situations.

The aetiology and mechanisms of ASD are not yet fully understood, and current treatment comprises mainly education and rehabilitation, without significant improvement in the core symptoms. Recent studies suggest that microbiota change in children with ASD after the ingestion of probiotics may improve the balance of microbiota and thus ASD symptoms. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics on the symptoms of children with ASD and the possible mechanisms involved. This is a prospective controlled trial. A total of 160 children with ASD will be stratified and allocated to placebo and probiotics groups randomised according to the severity of their ASD symptoms. The probiotics group will be given probiotics supplements orally twice a day for 3 months and the control group will be given a placebo at the same amount, in addition to the baseline therapy of education and rehabilitation. All the children will be evaluated systematically by using different scales, questionnaires before, during, and after 3 months' treatment, as well as 3 months after discontinuation. The potential impact of probiotics on immunity and inflammation, metabolism, and metagenome will also be investigated. Our previous study showed that the abundance of intestinal flora was greatly different in children with ASD, and that Bifidobacterium was associated with the severity of ASD. In the present study, we will investigate the impact of probiotics supplementation on the symptoms of Children with ASD, with the purpose of evaluating the possible therapeutic effects of additives on ASD and of providing a reference for clinical treatment. The results will help to disclose as yet unknown relationship between probiotics and ASD. This study has been registered with Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR-2000037941).","Zhang Lingling, Xu Yiran, Li Hongwei, Li Bingbing, Duan Guiqin, Zhu Changlian","PloS one","Autism Spectrum Disorder, Bifidobacterium, Child, Child, Preschool, Female, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Gastrointestinal Tract, Humans, Inflammation, Male, Metagenome, Placebos, Probiotics","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35202432","Henan Key Laboratory of Child Brain Injury and Henan Clinical Research Center for Child Neurological Disorders, Institute of Neuroscience and The Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.; Center for Child Behavioral Development, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.",

Symptom traits such as aberrant sensory reactivity are present across NDDs and might reflect common mechanistic pathways. Here, we test the effectiveness of repurposing a drug candidate, bumetanide, on irritable behavior in a cross-disorder neurodevelopmental cohort defined by the presence of sensory reactivity problems. Participants, aged 5-15 years and IQ ≥ 55, with ASD, ADHD, and/or epilepsy and proven aberrant sensory reactivity according to deviant Sensory Profile scores were included. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to bumetanide (max 1 mg twice daily) or placebo tablets for 91 days followed by a 28-day wash-out period using permuted block design and minimization. Participants, parents, healthcare providers, and outcome assessors were blinded for treatment allocation. Primary outcome was the differences in ABC-irritability at day 91. Secondary outcomes were differences in SRS-2, RBS-R, SP-NL, BRIEF parent, BRIEF teacher at D91. Differences were analyzed in a modified intention-to-treat sample with linear mixed models and side effects in the intention-to-treat population. A total of 38 participants (10.1 [SD 3.1] years) were enrolled between June 2017 and June 2019 in the Netherlands. Nineteen children were allocated to bumetanide and nineteen to placebo. Five patients discontinued (<i>n</i> = 3 bumetanide). Bumetanide was superior to placebo on the ABC-irritability [mean difference (MD) -4.78, 95%CI: -8.43 to -1.13, <i>p</i> = 0.0125]. No effects were found on secondary endpoints. No wash-out effects were found. Side effects were as expected: hypokalemia (<i>p</i> = 0.046) and increased diuresis (<i>p</i> = 0.020). Despite the results being underpowered, this study raises important recommendations for future cross-diagnostic trial designs.","van Andel Dorinde M, Sprengers Jan J, Keijzer-Veen Mandy G, Schulp Annelien J A, Lillien Marc R, Scheepers Floortje E, Bruining Hilgo","Frontiers in psychiatry",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35211042","Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.; Department of Psychiatry, University Medical Center Utrecht Brain Centre, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.; N=You Neurodevelopmental Precision Center, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Amsterdam Reproduction and Development, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",

This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a novel, manualized Acceptance and Commitment Therapy group intervention (Navigator ACT) in a sample of 94 parents of children with disabilities. Feasibility was measured by treatment completion, credibility, and satisfaction, and preliminary outcomes by using self-rating scales administered at the baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up. The results imply the intervention is feasible in the context of Swedish outpatient habilitation services. A preliminary analysis of the outcome measures suggests that parents experienced significant improvements in well-being. The results indicate that the treatment is feasible and should be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial.","Holmberg Bergman T, Renhorn E, Berg B, Lappalainen P, Ghaderi A, Hirvikoski T","Journal

Participants were ages 5 to 17 years with ASD and clinically significant anxiety (Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale [PARS] score ≥10). Thirty participants were randomized to mirtazapine (7.5-45 mg/day) or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. The co-primary outcome measures were the PARS and the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement subscale (CGI-I). Mirtazapine resulted in a statistically significant within group decrease in anxiety on the PARS (ES 1.76, p < 0.001). The improvement in PARS score for mirtazapine versus placebo was clinically meaningful but not statistically significant (ES = 0.63, p = 0.64). Forty-seven percent of participants assigned to mirtazapine (95% CI 22%: 74%) and 20% assigned to placebo (95% CI 2%: 60%) were rated ""much improved"" (CGI-I = 2) or ""very much improved"" (CGI-I = 1) for anxiety, p = 0.46. No statistically significant differences in mean 10-week changes between mirtazapine and placebo occurred on any outcome measure. There were no statistically significant differences in adverse effect frequency between mirtazapine and placebo. The results are consistent with mirtazapine's safety and tolerability and meet three of four pre-specified indicators of efficacy (statistically significant change in total PARS score for mirtazapine, numerically greater reduction in total PARS score for mirtazapine than placebo, numerically higher number of responders to mirtazapine than placebo, but not greater than 50% of participants receiving mirtazapine rated as responders). Implementation of a larger randomized controlled trial of mirtazapine for the treatment of anxiety in this population is supported.Clinical trial registration information: Mirtazapine Treatment of Anxiety in Children and Adolescents with Pervasive Developmental Disorders; https://clinicaltrials.gov ; NCT01302964.","McDougle Christopher J, Thom Robyn P, Ravichandran Caitlin T, Palumbo Michelle L, Politte Laura C, Mullett Jennifer E, Keary Christopher J, Erickson Craig A, Stigler Kimberly A, Mathieu-Frasier Lauren, Posey David J","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","Adolescent, Anxiety, Anxiety Disorders, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Double-Blind Method, Humans, Mirtazapine, Pilot Projects, Treatment Outcome","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35241779","Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, Cincinnati, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, USA.; WakeMed Children's Pediatric Behavioral Health, 3000 New Bern Ave, Raleigh, NC, 27610, USA.; Massachusetts General Hospital, 55 Fruit St, Boston, MA, 02114, USA. cmcdougle@mgh.harvard.edu.; Massachusetts General Hospital, 55 Fruit St, Boston, MA, 02114, USA.",

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used in the clinical management of ASD, especially in mainland China, where studies have shown promising efficacy. However, this remains to be further explored and clarified. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of conventional treatment-based TCM interventions for ASD. The study will be conducted from January 2022, and the following electronic databases will be searched: China Biological Medicine Database, Chinese Scientific Journals Database, Wan Fang database, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, and EMBASE Database. Only randomized controlled trials of TCM interventions for ASD will be included. The Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale, Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised, and Childhood Autism Rating Scale will be the primary outcome indicators. The methodological quality of this Bayesian-based network meta-analysis will be performed using the ""Risk of Bias"" tool. Stata 14.0 and WinBUGS 1.4.3 will be used to analyze the data. In addition, assessment of heterogeneity, inconsistency, subgroups, sensitivity, and publication bias will be conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration's tools. The results of this study will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. This study will help patients recover better, provide clinical evidence for practitioners, and promote the use of TCM in ASD interventions.","Feng Xiang, Li Keshang, Jiang Quanrui, Zhang Yuxing, Gong

We conducted a 20-week, multi-site, randomized controlled trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of the adjunctive use of NAC in OCD. The study was a phase III, 20-week, double-blind, randomized controlled trial across multiple sites in Australia investigating 2 g to 4 g per day of NAC (titrated according to response) in 98 participants with DSM-5 diagnosed OCD. Data were analysed using linear mixed effects models for the 89 participants who attended at least one follow-up visit. A modified intention-to-treat analysis of the primary outcome found no evidence that NAC reduced symptoms of OCD measured on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, relative to placebo (mean difference at week 20 = 0.53, 95% compatibility interval = -2.18, 3.23; p = 0.70; favouring placebo). There was also no evidence that NAC, compared to placebo, improved outcomes on the secondary measures including anxiety, depression, quality of life, functioning, or clinician/participant impression. NAC was well-tolerated with only mild gastrointestinal adverse events associated with the treatment.

Autism is a disorder with an increasing prevalence characterized by an enormous individual, family, and social cost. Although the etiology of autism spectrum disorder is unknown, an interaction between genetic and environmental factors is implicated, converging in altered brain synaptogenesis and, therefore, connectivity. Besides deepening the knowledge on the resting brain electrical activity that characterizes this disorder, this study allows analyzing the positive central effects of a 6-month therapy with a probiotic through a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study and the correlations between electroencephalography activity and biochemical and clinical parameters. In subjects treated with probiotics, we observed a decrease of power in frontopolar regions in beta and gamma bands, and increased coherence in the same bands together with a shift in frontal asymmetry, which suggests a modification toward a typical brain activity. Electroencephalography measures were significantly correlated with clinical and biochemical measures. These findings support the importance of further investigations on probiotics' benefits in autism spectrum disorder to better elucidate mechanistic links between probiotics supplementation and changes in brain activity.","Billeci Lucia, Callara Alejandro Luis, Guiducci Letizia, Prosperi Margherita, Morales Maria Aurora, Calderoni Sara, Muratori Filippo, Santocchi Elisa","Autism : the international journal of research and practice","Humans, Autistic Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Brain, Probiotics, Electroencephalography","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35362336","Department of Developmental Neuroscience, IRCCS Stella Maris Foundation, Pisa, Italy.; Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Research Council, Pisa, Italy.; UFSMIA zona Valle del Serchio, Azienda USL Toscana Nord Ovest, Castelnuovo Garfagnana (LU), Italy.; Research Center 'E.

"3543069",,"Untoward effects of fenfluramine in autistic children.","1986-12-01","Several recent studies have described the benefits of fenfluramine for the symptomatic treatment of infantile autism. No large surveys of side effects of this drug have been reported in autistic children. To evaluate the untoward effects of fenfluramine in children with autism, 12 subjects were systematically studied. Medication was administered in a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study. Parents were trained in monitoring untoward effects. These observations were compiled in detailed daily notes. In addition, four cases describing unusual effects found in a sample of 170 patients treated with fenfluramine are also reported. In the initial 2 weeks of active drug listlessness, food refusal, and stomach upset were frequently seen. A different pattern of untoward effects was seen in the final 14 weeks of treatment. Irritability, agitation, and crying along with continued food refusal were noted. The subjects lost 2.1% of body weight during active drug phase, but there was a rebound weight gain during the subsequent placebo phase. A thorough understanding of fenfluramine's side effects and adverse reactions is necessary so as to differentiate them from the multiple symptoms inherent in the syndrome of autism.","Realmuto G M, Jensen J, Klykylo W, Piggott L, Stubbs G, Yuwiler A, Geller E, Freeman B J, Ritvo E","Journal of clinical psychopharmacology","Adolescent, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Clinical Trials as Topic, Double-Blind Method, Female, Fenfluramine, Humans, Male, Serotonin","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3543069",,

The 6-session BPT, delivered in a group format, focused on high-frequency challenging behaviors (e.g., problem behaviors, feeding and sleep issues). Caregivers who received BPT (n = 29), relative to an active control (psychoeducation/supportive therapy; n = 9), reported higher treatment satisfaction and acceptability. Challenging behaviors were reduced in the BPT and active control groups.

However, the molecular underpinnings of autistic-neurotypical serotonergic differences are challenging to access in vivo. Receptor-Enriched Analysis of functional Connectivity by Targets (REACT) has helped define molecular-enriched functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain networks based on a priori information about the spatial distribution of neurochemical systems from available PET templates. We used REACT to estimate the dominant fMRI signal related to the serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT) distribution during processing of aversive facial emotion in adults with and without ASD. We first predicted a group difference in baseline (placebo) functioning of this system. We next used a single 20 mg oral dose of citalopram, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, to test the hypothesis that network activity in people with and without ASD would respond differently to inhibition of SERT. To confirm the specificity of our findings, we also repeated the analysis with 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A and 5-HT4 receptor maps. Using REACT with the SERT map, we found a baseline group difference in the SERT-enriched response to faces in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. A single oral dose of citalopram 'shifted' the response in the ASD group towards the neurotypical baseline but did not alter response in the control group. Similar differences in SERT-enriched response were observed after controlling for other 5-HT maps. Our findings suggest that the SERT-enriched functional network is dynamically different in ASD during processing of socially relevant stimuli. Whether this acute neurobiological response to citalopram in ASD translates to a clinical target will be an important next step.","Wong Nichol Ml, Dipasquale Ottavia, Turkheimer Federico, Findon James L, Wichers Robert H, Dimitrov Mihail, Murphy Clodagh M, Stoencheva Vladimira, Robertson Dene M, Murphy Declan G, Daly Eileen, McAlonan Grainne M","Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)","Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Brain, Citalopram, Cross-Over Studies, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Serotonin, Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35491679","Department of Neuroimaging, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; Behavioural Genetics Clinic, Adult Autism and ADHD Service, Behavioural and Developmental Psychiatry Clinical Academic Group, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.",

Despite their prevalence and impact, there are no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed at evaluating the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for anxiolysis in this population, who may have a different biological basis for anxiety. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Secondary analyses of the STAART double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT of citalopram in children with ASD examined whether citalopram reduced anxiety measured on the parent-reported Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory-4 (CASI-4) as the primary outcome. An intention-to-treat analysis involving all 149 participants used multiple imputations for missing data and included baseline stratification factors of age group and site, among others. We prespecified as clinically significant a 33% reduction in anxiety in citalopram versus placebo, coinciding with 80% power. We tested whether communicative ability on the Vineland Communication score moderated treatment effect and explored whether initial anxiety was associated with greater adverse events, which could impact on dose titration and achieving optimal dose. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Both groups showed substantial reduction in anxiety. Citalopram was associated with a nonsignificant 16.5% greater reduction (observed coefficient = -0.181, bootstrap standard error = 0.126, <i>p</i> = 0.151, confidence interval = -0.428 to 0.066). Anxiety reports were significantly lower in children with reduced communicative ability, but communicative ability did not moderate the treatment effect (interaction <i>p</i> = 0.294). Initial anxiety levels were not associated with increased adverse effects (interaction <i>p</i>s 0.162-0.954). <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Citalopram did not statistically significantly improve anxiety in children with ASD. Clinicians should be cautious in their use of SSRIs for this indication. There remains a need for well-powered clinical trials testing the efficacy of SSRIs among autistic children with anxiety disorders.","Simonoff Emily, Mowlem Florence, Pearson Oliver, Anagnostou

Previous trials investigating effects of daily intranasal oxytocin treatment have reported inconsistent results and have not combined it with positive social interaction. However, in two preclinical studies we established that treatment every other day rather than daily is more efficacious in maintaining neural and behavioral effects by reducing receptor desensitization. We aimed to establish whether a 6-week intranasal oxytocin compared with placebo treatment, followed by a period of positive social interaction, would produce reliable symptom improvements in children with ASD. A pilot double-blind, randomized, crossover design trial was completed including 41 children with ASD aged 3-8 years. Primary outcomes were the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 (ADOS-2) and social responsivity scale-2 (SRS-2). Secondary measures included cognitive, autism- and caregiver-related questionnaires, and social attention assessed using eye-tracking. Significant improvements were found for oxytocin relative to placebo in primary outcome measures (total ADOS-2 and SRS-2 scores, ps < 0.001) and in behavioral adaptability and repetitive behavior secondary measures. Altered SRS-2 scores were associated with increased saliva oxytocin concentrations. Additionally, oxytocin significantly increased time spent viewing dynamic social compared to geometric stimuli and the eyes of angry, happy, and neutral expression faces. There were no adverse side effects of oxytocin treatment. Overall, results demonstrate that a 6-week intranasal oxytocin treatment administered every other day and followed by positive social interactions can improve clinical, eye tracking, and questionnaire-based assessments of symptoms in young autistic children.","Le Jiao, Zhang Lan, Zhao Weihua, Zhu Siyu, Lan Chunmei, Kou Juan, Zhang Qianqian, Zhang Yingying, Li Qin, Chen Zhuo, Fu Meina, Montag Christian, Zhang Rong, Yang Wenxu, Becker Benjamin, Kendrick Keith M","Psychotherapy and psychosomatics","Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Child, Double-Blind Method, Humans, Oxytocin, Pilot Projects, Social Interaction","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35545057","Chengdu Women's and Children's Central Hospital, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.; Department of Molecular Psychology, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.; Neuroscience Research Institute, Peking University, Beijing, China.; The Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, MOE Key Laboratory for Neuroinformation, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.",

We conducted an overview of reviews to synthesize early intervention literature for very young children with or at high likelihood for ASD. Cochrane guidance on how to perform overviews of reviews was followed. Comprehensive searches of databases were conducted for systematic reviews and meta-analyses between January 2009 and December 2020. Review data were extracted and summarized and methodological quality was assessed. Primary randomized controlled trial evidence was summarized and risk of bias assessed. This overview of reviews was not registered. From 762 records, 78 full texts were reviewed and seven systematic reviews and meta-analyses with 63 unique studies were identified. Several interventional approaches (naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention, and developmental and behavioral interventions) improved child developmental outcomes. Heterogeneity in design, intervention and control group, dose, delivery agent, and measurement approach was noted. Inconsistent methodological quality and potential biases were identified. While many early interventional approaches have an impact on child outcomes, study heterogeneity and quality had an impact on our ability to draw firm conclusions regarding which treatments are most effective. Advances in trial methodology and design, and increasing attention to mitigating measurement bias, will advance the quality of the ASD early intervention evidence base. Naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions, as well as developmental and behavioral interventions, improve child outcomes in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). If only randomized controlled trials are considered, guidelines for early intensive behavioral intervention in younger children should be revisited. The greatest intervention impacts were on proximal, intervention-specific outcomes. Inadequacies in the quality of the early ASD intervention evidence base were observed.","Franz Lauren, Goodwin Cara D, Rieder Amber, Matheis Maya, Damiano Diane L","Developmental medicine and child

"35617670","10.47626/2237-6089-2021-0396","Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of cannabidiol-rich cannabis extract in children with autism spectrum disorder: randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled clinical trial.","2024-01-01","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction and by restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior. Some studies have shown that substances derived from Cannabis sativa improve the quality of life of children with ASD without causing serious adverse effects, thus providing an alternative therapeutic option. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a cannabis extract rich in cannabidiol (CBD) in children with ASD. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 60 children, aged from 5 to 11 years, were selected and divided into two groups: the treatment group, which received the CBD-rich cannabis extract, and the control group, which received the placebo. They both used their respective products for a period of 12 weeks. Statistical analysis was done by two-factor mixed analysis of variance (two-way ANOVA). Significant results were found for social interaction (F1,116 = 14.13, p = 0.0002), anxiety (F1,116 = 5.99, p = 0.016), psychomotor agitation (F1,116 = 9.22, p = 0.003), number of meals a day (F1,116 = 4.11, p = 0.04), and concentration (F1,48 = 6.75, p = 0.01), the last of which was only significant in mild ASD cases. Regarding safety, it was found that only three children in the treatment group (9.7%) had adverse effects, namely dizziness, insomnia, colic, and weight gain.

Explore effects of combined dietary docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, gamma-linolenic acid, and oleic acid (omega 3-6-9) on caregiver-reported behavior and sleep in toddlers born at ≤29 weeks' gestation who were exhibiting symptoms commonly seen with ASD. 90-day randomized (1:1), double blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Thirty-one children aged 18-38 months received omega 3-6-9 (n = 15) or canola oil placebo (n = 16). Mixed effects regression analyses followed intent to treat and explored treatment effects on measures of caregiver-reported behavior (Child Behavior Checklist 1.5-5, Toddler Behavior Assessment Questionnaire - Short Form, Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, 2nd Edition) and sleep (Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire, Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire). Twenty-nine of 31 (94%; n<sub>tx</sub> = 13, n<sub>placebo</sub> = 16) children randomized had data available for at least one outcome measure, 27 (87%; n<sub>tx</sub> = 12, n<sub>placebo</sub> = 15) had complete outcome data. Children randomized to omega 3-6-9 experienced a medium magnitude benefit of supplementation on anxious and depressed behaviors (Δ<sub>Difference</sub> = -1.27, d = -0.58, p = 0.049) and internalizing behaviors (Δ<sub>Difference</sub> = -3.41, d = -0.68, p = 0.05); and a large magnitude benefit on interpersonal relationship adaptive behaviors (Δ<sub>Difference</sub> = 7.50, d = 0.83, p = 0.01), compared to placebo. No effects were observed on other aspects of behavior or sleep. Findings provide preliminary support for further exploration of omega 3-6-9 during toddlerhood to improve socioemotional outcomes among children born preterm, especially for those showing early symptoms commonly seen with ASD.

However, it is unknown whether GT affects disposition of hydrophilic anti-allergic drugs. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine are affected by catechins, major GT components. A randomized, open, 2-phase crossover study was conducted in 10 healthy Japanese volunteers. After overnight fasting, subjects were simultaneously administered fexofenadine (60 mg) and pseudoephedrine (120 mg) with an aqueous solution of green tea extract (GTE) containing (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) of ~ 300 mg or water (control). In vitro transport assays were performed using HEK293 cells stably expressing organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1A2 to evaluate the inhibitory effect of EGCG on OATP1A2-mediated fexofenadine transport. In the GTE phase, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and the amount excreted unchanged into urine for 24 hours of fexofenadine were significantly decreased by 70% (P < 0.001) and 67% (P < 0.001), respectively, compared with control. There were no differences in time to maximum plasma concentration and the elimination half-life of fexofenadine between phases. Fexofenadine was confirmed to be a substrate of OATP1A2, and EGCG (100 and 1,000 μM) and GTE (0.1 and 1 mg/mL) inhibited OATP1A2-mediated uptake of fexofenadine. On the contrary, the concomitant administration of GTE did not influence the pharmacokinetics of pseudoephedrine. These results suggest that intake of GT may result in a markedly reduced exposure of fexofenadine, but not of pseudoephedrine, putatively by inhibiting OATP1A2-mediated intestinal absorption.","Misaka Shingen, Ono Yuko, Taudte R Verena, Hoier Eva, Ogata Hiroshi, Ono Tomoyuki, König Jörg, Watanabe Hiroshi, Fromm Martin F, Shimomura Kenju","Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics","Antioxidants, Catechin, Cross-Over Studies, HEK293 Cells, Healthy Volunteers, Humans, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Plant Extracts, Pseudoephedrine, Tea, Terfenadine","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35678032","Institute of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Erlangen, Germany.; Department of Bioregulation and Pharmacological Medicine, School of Medicine, Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine, Fukushima, Japan.; Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan.",

We conducted an umbrella review (PubMed/Cochrane Library/PsycINFO-04-Jul-2021, PROSPERO/CRD42020158827) for meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on deep brain stimulation (DBS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), electro-convulsive therapy (ECT), and others. Co-primary outcomes were standardized mean differences (SMD) of disease-specific symptoms, and acceptability (for all-cause discontinuation). Evidence was assessed with AMSTAR/AMSTAR-Content/GRADE. We selected 102 meta-analyses. Effective interventions compared to sham were in depressive disorders: ECT (SMD=0.91/GRADE=moderate), TMS (SMD=0.51/GRADE=moderate), tDCS (SMD=0.46/GRADE=low), DBS (SMD=0.42/GRADE=very low), light therapy (SMD=0.41/GRADE=low); schizophrenia: ECT (SMD=0.88/GRADE=moderate), tDCS (SMD=0.45/GRADE=very low), TMS (prefrontal theta-burst, SMD=0.58/GRADE=low; left-temporoparietal, SMD=0.42/GRADE=low); substance use disorder: TMS (high frequency-dorsolateral-prefrontal-deep (SMD=1.16/GRADE=moderate), high frequency-left dorsolateral-prefrontal (SMD=0.77/GRADE=very low); OCD: DBS (SMD=0.89/GRADE=moderate), TMS (SMD=0.64/GRADE=very low); PTSD: TMS (SMD=0.46/GRADE=moderate); generalized anxiety disorder: TMS (SMD=0.68/GRADE=low); ADHD: tDCS (SMD=0.23/GRADE=moderate); autism: tDCS (SMD=0.97/GRADE=very low). No significant differences for acceptability emerged. Median AMSTAR/AMSTAR-Content was 8/2 (suggesting high-quality meta-analyses/low-quality RCTs), GRADE low. Despite limited certainty, biological non-pharmacological interventions are effective and safe for numerous mental conditions. Results inform future research, and guidelines.

"35790873","10.1038/S41380-022-01670-Z","Efficacy of psychosocial interventions for Autism spectrum disorder: an umbrella review.","2022-09-01","The wide range of psychosocial interventions designed to assist people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) makes it challenging to compile and hierarchize the scientific evidence that supports the efficacy of these interventions. Thus, we performed an umbrella review of published meta-analyses of controlled clinical trials that investigated the efficacy of psychosocial interventions on both core and related ASD symptoms. Each meta-analysis that was identified was re-estimated using a random-effects model with a restricted maximum likelihood estimator. The methodological quality of included meta-analyses was critically appraised and the credibility of the evidence was assessed algorithmically according to criteria adapted for the purpose of this study. We identified a total of 128 meta-analyses derived from 44 reports. More than half of the non-overlapping meta-analyses were nominally statistically significant and/or displayed a moderate-to-large pooled effect size that favored the psychosocial interventions. The assessment of the credibility of evidence pointed out that the efficacy of early intensive behavioral interventions, developmental interventions, naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions, and parent-mediated interventions was supported by suggestive evidence on at least one outcome in preschool children. Possible outcomes included social communication deficits, global cognitive abilities, and adaptive behaviors. Results also revealed highly suggestive indications that parent-mediated interventions improved disruptive behaviors in early school-aged children. The efficacy of social skills groups was supported by suggestive evidence for improving social communication deficits and overall ASD symptoms in school-aged children and adolescents. Only four meta-analyses had a statistically significant pooled effect size in a sensitivity analysis restricted to randomized controlled trials at low risk of detection bias. This umbrella review confirmed that several psychosocial interventions show promise for improving symptoms related to ASD at different stages of life. However, additional well-designed randomized controlled trials are still required to produce a clearer picture of the efficacy of these interventions. To facilitate the dissemination of scientific knowledge about psychosocial interventions for individuals with ASD, we built an open-access and interactive website that shares the information collected and the results generated during this umbrella review.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of balovaptan, an oral selective vasopressin 1a receptor antagonist, compared with placebo in children and adolescents with ASD. The aV1ation study was a randomized, double-blind, 24-week, parallel-group, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial. Between November 22, 2016, and September 3, 2019, individuals were screened and randomly assigned to treatment groups. The primary efficacy analysis population comprised participants taking age-adjusted balovaptan equivalent to a 10-mg adult dose and participants from the concurrently randomized placebo group. This multicenter trial took place across 41 sites in the US. Participants were aged 5 to 17 years with diagnosed ASD and an IQ of 70 or greater. Data were analyzed from April 8 to November 16, 2020. Participants were randomly assigned to daily 4-mg or 10-mg adult-equivalent balovaptan or placebo, until the 4-mg group was discontinued. The primary end point was change from baseline on the Vineland-II two-domain composite (2DC; socialization and communication domains) score at week 24. Between November 2016 and September 2019, a total of 599 individuals were screened and 339 participants were randomly assigned to receive 4-mg balovaptan adult-equivalent dose (91 [26.8%]), 10-mg balovaptan adult-equivalent dose (126 [37.2%]), or placebo (122 [36.0%]). Primary analysis included 86 participants assigned to receive 10-mg balovaptan adult-equivalent dose and 81 assigned to receive placebo (mean [SD] age, 12.1 [3.4] years; 139 male participants [83.2%]). No statistically significant differences were observed between the balovaptan and placebo groups in change from baseline on the Vineland-II 2DC score at week 24 (difference in adjusted least-squares mean, -0.16; 90% CI, -2.56 to 2.23; P = .91). No improvements for balovaptan vs placebo were observed at week 24 for any secondary end points. Balovaptan was well tolerated with no emerging safety concerns. Similar proportions of participants reported adverse events (balovaptan, 66 of 86 [76.7%] vs placebo, 61 of 81 [75.3%]) and serious adverse events (balovaptan, 1 of 86 [1.2%] vs placebo, 4 of 81 [4.9%]). In this randomized clinical trial, balovaptan did not demonstrate efficacy in improvement of socialization and communication in this population with pediatric ASD. Balovaptan was well tolerated in children 5 years or older. Further development of robust, sensitive, and objective outcome measures may help to improve future studies in the assessment of therapies targeting communication and socialization in pediatric ASD.

However, none of the studies have directly compared the effectiveness between the two interventions on treating sleep disturbance in children with ASD. Without direct comparison, we do not know which intervention is better. Thus, we designed a study to compare which intervention is more effective to treat sleep disturbance in children with ASD and to examine whether the combination of the two could be the most efficacious. We present a protocol for conducting a randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of physical exercise and melatonin supplement on treating sleep disturbance in children with ASD. The proposed study will be a four-group randomised control trial (RCT) design, with equal allocation of participants to the three intervention groups and one control group. All eligible participants will be randomly allocated to a morning jogging group, a melatonin supplement group, a combination group and a control group. Changes in sleep quality will be monitored through actigraphic assessment and parental sleep logs. Melatonin levels represented by 6-sulfoxymelatonin will be measured from the participants' 24-h and the first morning void urinary samples. All the assessments will be carried out before the intervention (T1), in the mid of the study (5 weeks after the commencement of the study) (T2) and after the 10-week intervention (T3). Level of statistical significance will be set at 5% (i.e. p < .05). The results of this trial will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journal. The findings will provide evidence to determine whether physical exercise or melatonin supplement or the combination of interventions is the most effective to treat sleep disturbance in children with ASD.","Tse Andy Choi Yeung, Lee Paul Hong, Lau Esther Yuet Ying, Cheng James Ching Hei, Ho Amy Wing Yin, Lai Elvis Wing Him","PloS one","Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Exercise, Humans, Melatonin, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Sleep Quality, Sleep Wake Disorders","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35793342","Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Health, United Christian Hospital, Hong Kong, China.; Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom.; Department of Health and Physical Education, Education University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Department of Psychology, Education University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Department of Psychiatry, The Hong Kong Castle Peak Hospital, Hong Kong, China.; Department of Chemical Pathology, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.",

There is a need for adjunct treatments to augment clozapine, notably for negative and cognitive symptoms. One such potential agent is the glutathione precursor N-acetylcysteine (NAC). A randomized double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled trial for clozapine patients with enduring psychotic symptoms (n = 84) was undertaken to investigate the efficacy of adjunctive NAC (2 g daily) for negative symptoms, cognition and quality of life (QoL).

The period following a child's autism diagnosis can present real challenges in adaptation for families. Twenty to 50% of caregivers show clinically significant levels of mental health need within the post-diagnostic period and on an ongoing basis. Best practice guidelines recommend timely post-diagnostic family support. Current provision is patchy, largely unevidenced, and a source of dissatisfaction for both families and professionals. There is a pressing need for an evidenced programme of post-diagnostic support focusing on caregiver mental health and adjustment, alongside autism psycho-education. This trial tests the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a new brief manualised psychosocial intervention designed to address this gap. This is a multi-centre two-parallel-group single (researcher)-blinded randomised controlled trial of the Empower-Autism programme plus treatment-as-usual versus usual local post-diagnostic offer plus treatment-as-usual. Caregivers of children aged 2-15 years with a recent autism diagnosis will be recruited from North West England NHS or local authority centres. Randomisation is individually by child, with one ""index"" caregiver per child, stratified by centre, using 2:1 randomisation ratio to assist recruitment and timely intervention. Empower-Autism is a group-based, manualised, post-diagnostic programme that combines autism psycho-education and psychotherapeutic components based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy to support caregiver mental health, stress management and adjustment to their child's diagnosis. The comparator is any usual local group-based post-diagnostic psycho-education offer. Receipt of services will be specified through health economic data. caregiver mental health (General Health Questionnaire-30) at 52-week follow-up. key caregiver measures (wellbeing, self-efficacy, adjustment, autism knowledge) at 12-, 26- and 52-week follow-up and family and child outcomes (wellbeing and functioning) at 52-week endpoint.

Primary analysis will follow intention-to-treat principles using linear mixed models with random intercepts for group membership and repeated measures. Cost-effectiveness acceptability analyses will be over 52 weeks, with decision modelling to extrapolate to longer time periods.

The endocannabinoid system (ECS) seems to play a role in social behavior and emotional processing while it also seems to play a role in those neuropsychiatric conditions showing social cognition impairments. Main plant cannabinoids delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) modulate the ECS and, due to their opposite effects, have been proposed as both cause and treatment for neuropsychiatric-related disorders such as schizophrenia, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The aim of this study was to test the effects of THC and CBD on social cognition abilities in chronic cannabis users. <b>Method:</b> Eighteen members from a cannabis social club were tested for social cognition effects under the effects of different full spectrum cannabis extracts containing either THC, CBD, THC+CBD, or placebo in a naturalistic randomized double-blind crossover placebo-controlled study. <b>Results:</b> Results showed that participants under the effects of THC showed lower cognitive empathy when compared with the effects of CBD but not when those were compared with THC+CBD or placebo. Also, participants showed higher cognitive ToM under the effects of CBD when compared with the effects of placebo, but not when those were compared with THC or THC+CBD. However, we did not find differences on the emotional scales for empathy or ToM. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study provides evidence for the interaction between the effects of THC and CBD and social cognition abilities in a naturalistic environment, which can be of special interest for the clinical practice of medical cannabis on neuropsychiatric disorders. We show for the first time that CBD can improve ToM abilities in chronic cannabis users. Our results might help to understand the role of the ECS in social cognition, and their association with psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia or autism. Finally, we demonstrate how reliable methodologies can be implemented in naturalistic environments to collect valid ecological evidence outside classic laboratory settings.","Sainz-Cort Alberto, Jimenez-Garrido Daniel, Muñoz-Marron Elena, Viejo-Sobera Raquel, Heeroma Joost, Bouso Jose Carlos","Cannabis and cannabinoid research","Humans, Cannabidiol, Cannabinoids, Cannabis, Dronabinol, Hallucinogens, Social Cognition, Double-Blind Method, Cross-Over Studies","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35881851","GH Medical, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; International Center of Ethnobotanic Education, Research and Service (ICEERS), Barcelona, Spain.; Faculty of Health Sciences, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC), Barcelona, Spain.",

However, previous trials are characterized by small sample sizes, heterogeneous methodologies, and short treatment periods using clinic-based tDCS. To determine the efficacy and safety of home-based tDCS in treating inattention symptoms in adult patients with ADHD. Randomized, double-blind, parallel, sham-controlled clinical trial (tDCS for the Treatment of Inattention Symptoms in Adult Patients With ADHD [TUNED]), conducted from July 2019 through July 2021 in a single-center outpatient academic setting. Of 277 potential participants screened by phone, 150 were assessed for eligibility on site, and 64 were included. Participants were adults with ADHD, inattentive or combined subtype. Exclusion criteria included current stimulant drug treatment, current moderate to severe symptoms of depression or anxiety, diagnosis of bipolar disorder with a manic or depressive episode in the last year, diagnosis of schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder, and diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder; 55 of participants completed follow-up after 4 weeks. Thirty-minute daily sessions of home-based tDCS for 4 weeks, 2 mA anodal-right and cathodal-left prefrontal stimulation with 35-cm2 carbon electrodes. Inattentive scores in the clinician-administered version of the Adult ADHD Self-report Scale version 1.1 (CASRS-I). Included in this trial were 64 participants with ADHD (31 [48%] inattentive presentation and 33 [52%] combined presentation), with a mean (SD) age of 38.3 (9.6) years. Thirty participants (47%) were women and 34 (53%) were men. Fifty-five finished the trial. At week 4, the mean (SD) inattention score, as measured with CASRS-I, was 18.88 (5.79) in the active tDCS group and 23.63 (3.97) in the sham tDCS group. Linear mixed-effects models revealed a statistically significant treatment by time interaction for CASRS-I (βinteraction = -3.18; 95% CI, -4.60 to -1.75; P < .001), showing decreased symptoms of inattention in the active tDCS group over the 3 assessments compared to the sham tDCS group. Mild adverse events were more frequent in the active tDCS group, particularly skin redness, headache, and scalp burn. In this randomized clinical trial, daily treatment with a home-based tDCS device over 4 weeks improved attention in adult patients with ADHD who were not taking stimulant medication. Home-based tDCS could be a nonpharmacological alternative for patients with ADHD.

Carboxyhemoglobin (SpCO) as a non-invasive measurement of inflammation has not been studied in individuals with ASD. We conducted this post-hoc study based on our published clinical trial to explore SpCO and its association with ASD severity, autoimmunity, and response to daily Lactobacillus plantarum probiotic supplementation. In this study, we included 35 individuals with ASD aged 3-20 years from a previously published clinical trial of the probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive daily Lactobacillus plantarum probiotic (6 × 10<sup>10</sup> CFUs) or a placebo for 16 weeks. The outcomes in this analysis include Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), Aberrant Behavior Checklist second edition (ABC-2), Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, SpCO measured by CO-oximetry, fecal microbiome by 16 s rRNA sequencing, blood serum inflammatory markers, autoantibodies, and oxytocin (OT) by ELISA. We performed Kendall's correlation to examine their interrelationships and used Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare the means of all outcomes between the two groups at baseline and 16 weeks. Elevated levels of serum anti-tubulin, CaM kinase II, anti-dopamine receptor D1 (anti-D1), and SpCO were found in the majority of ASD subjects. ASD severity is correlated with SpCO (baseline, R = 0.38, p = 0.029), anti-lysoganglioside GM1 (R = 0.83, p = 0.022), anti-tubulin (R = 0.69, p = 0.042), and anti-D1 (R = 0.71, p = 0.045) in treatment group. The findings of the present study suggests that the easily administered and non-invasive SpCO test offers a potentially promising autoimmunity and inflammatory biomarker to screen/subgroup ASD and monitor the treatment response to probiotics. Furthermore, we propose that the associations between autoantibodies, gut microbiome profile, serum OT level, GI symptom severity, and ASD core symptom severity scores are specific to the usage of probiotic treatment in our subject cohort. Taken together, these results warrant further studies to improve ASD early diagnosis and treatment outcomes.

"35958966",,"Use of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Child Psychiatry.","2022-01-01","Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive diagnostic and therapeutic technique that has showed benefits in various psychiatric disorders. Although there is a large body of literature available on its use in adult populations, existing research in pediatric populations is very limited. Current research has primarily focused on its use in adolescent treatment-resistant depression. However, recently, rTMS has gained attention among researchers to find its utility in other neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), tics, and psychosis. There is a lack of systematic data on the safety of rTMS in children and adolescents. The aim of this article was to present an overview of the existing literature on the use of rTMS in children and adolescents and examine the relevant safety considerations. We conducted a literature review of the English literature in PubMed on TMS in children and adolescents, using comprehensive search terms and expanding our review to include sources cited by these reports.

Intranasal administration of OXT is widely used to examine the drug's functional effects in both adults and children and is assumed to enter the brain directly via this route. However, OXT can also influence brain function through increased blood concentrations, and we have recently shown that orally (lingual) administered OXT also modulates neural responses to emotional faces and may be better tolerated for therapeutic use. Here, we examine whether 24 IU OXT administered orally can facilitate social attention. In a randomized, placebo-controlled pharmacologic study, we used a validated emotional antisaccade eye-tracking paradigm to explore the effects of oral OXT on bottom-up and top-down attention processing in 80 healthy male participants. Our findings showed that in terms of top-down attention, oral OXT increased errors for both social (angry, fearful, happy, sad, and neutral emotion faces) and nonsocial stimuli (oval shapes) in the antisaccade condition but increased response latencies only in the social condition. It also significantly reduced post-task state anxiety, but this reduction was not correlated with task performance. A comparison with our previous intranasal OXT study using the same task revealed that both routes have a similar effect on increasing antisaccade errors and response latencies and on reducing state anxiety. Overall, our findings suggest that oral administration of OXT produces similar effects on top-down social attention control and anxiety to intranasal administration and may therefore have therapeutic utility.","Zhuang Qian, Zheng Xiaoxiao, Yao Shuxia, Zhao Weihua, Becker Benjamin, Xu Xiaolei, Kendrick Keith M","The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology","Adult, Child, Male, Humans, Oxytocin, Administration, Intranasal, Facial Expression, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Double-Blind Method, Attention, Administration, Oral","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36053298","The Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, MOE Key Laboratory for Neuroinformation, Center for Information in Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.",
"36053934","10.1002/Aur.2800","The effectiveness of an attention-based intervention for school-aged autistic children with anger regulating problems: A randomized controlled trial.","2022-10-01","Anger regulation is a challenge for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We investigated if attention-based cognitive behavioral treatment, based on mindfulness cognitive therapy (MBCT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), reduces aggressive behavior and improves anger coping in school-aged autistic children (n = 51). Children were randomized to an active-control or a treatment condition. The treatment included nine weekly sessions attention-based individual therapy. Parents in both conditions received three weekly psychoeducation group sessions to heighten awareness of expressed emotion (EE). For aggressive behavior, treatment reduced temper tantrums and arguing. No effect was found on destroying things and physical violence. For anger coping, treatment increased adaptive coping strategies of diffusion and social support seeking, but had no effect on assertion, rumination, and maladaptive coping direct anger out and avoidance. Treatment did not impact secondary outcome measures concerning children's quality of life (QoL) and parental stress-levels and psychological well-being. In conclusion, school-aged autistic children are able to acquire self-regulation skills reducing temper tantrums and arguing and increasing the use of adaptive anger coping strategies. The intervention shows potential to improve behavior and regulation, but little transfer to other domains. Limitations and future directions involving the child's social environment, including parents, siblings, and teachers are discussed. LAY SUMMARY: Children on the autism spectrum often show aggressive behavior. Treatment can train children to be more aware of their emotions. This study found that this can help reducing temper tantrums and arguing and increasing some coping skills, though no impact was found on several other domains of aggression and coping.","Clifford

While several studies show that oxytocin (OT) modulates neural activation in social-related neural regions, the mechanism that underlies OT effects in ASD is not fully known yet. Despite evidence from animal studies on connections between the oxytocinergic system and excitation/inhibition neural balance, the influence of OT on oscillatory responses among individuals with ASD has been rarely examined. To bridge these gaps in knowledge, we investigated the effects of OT on both social and non-social stimuli while focusing on its specific influence on the neural connectivity between three socially related neural regions-the left and right fusiform and the medial frontal cortex. Twenty-five adolescents with ASD participated in a wall-established social task during a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled MEG and OT administration study. Our main task was a social-related task that required the identification of social and non-social-related pictures. We hypothesized that OT would modulate the oscillatory connectivity between three pre-selected regions of interest to be more adaptive to social processing. Specifically, we focused on alpha and gamma bands which are known to play an important role in face processing and top-down/bottom-up balance. Compared to placebo, OT reduced the connectivity between the medial frontal cortex and the fusiform in the low gamma more for social stimuli than for non-social ones, a reduction that was correlated with individuals' performance in the task. Additionally, for both social and non-social stimuli, OT increased the connectivity in the alpha and beta bands. Sample size was determined based on sample sizes previously reported in MEG in clinical populations, especially OT administration studies in combination with neuroimaging in ASD. We were limited in our capability to recruit for such a study, and as such, the sample size was not based on a priori power analysis. Additionally, we limited our analyses to specific neural bands and regions. To validate the current results, future studies may be needed to explore other parameters using whole-brain approaches in larger samples. These results suggest that OT influenced social perception by modifying the communication between frontal and posterior regions, an attenuation that potentially impacts both social and non-social early perception. We also show that OT influences differ between top-down and bottom-up processes, depending on the social context. Overall, by showing that OT influences both social-related perception and overall attention during early processing stages, we add new information to the existing understanding of the impact of OT on neural processing in ASD. Furthermore, by highlighting the influence of OT on early perception, we provide new directions for treatments for difficulties in early attentional phases in this population.

One of these approaches is modulation of activity of the brain regions involved in ASD symptoms. This study examined the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on autism symptom severity, theory of mind, emotion regulation strategies, and emotional-behavioral functions in children with ASD. Thirty-two children (M<sub>age</sub>  = 10.16, SD = 1.93, range 7-12 years) diagnosed with ASD were randomly assigned to active (N = 17) or sham stimulation (N = 15) groups in a randomized, sham-controlled, parallel-group design. Participants underwent 10 sessions of active (1.5 mA, 15 min, bilateral left anodal/right cathodal DLPFC, 2 sessions per week) or sham tDCS. Autism symptom severity, theory of mind, emotion regulation strategies, and emotional-behavioral functioning of the patients were assessed at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and 1 month after the intervention. A significant improvement of autism symptom severity (i.e., communication), theory of mind (i.e., ToM 3), and emotion regulation strategies was observed for the active as compared to the sham stimulation group at the end of the intervention, and these effects were maintained at the one-month follow-up. The results suggest that repeated tDCS with anodal stimulation of left and cathodal stimulation of right DLPFC improves autism symptom severity as well as social cognition and emotion regulation in ASD. LAY SUMMARY: Previous research has suggested that targeting core mechanisms underlying cognitive-emotional and behavioral deficits of autistic children might improve symptoms of ASD. Deficient social and behavioral functioning, impaired theory of mind, and emotional regulation deficits have been identified as core treatment targets for this group. Specific subregions of the prefrontal cortex are involved in these deficits, including hypoactivity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Upregulation of this area with non-invasive brain stimulation, namely anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), results in improved social and behavioral functioning in children with ASD. Very few studies have however examined the effects of this intervention on theory of mind, emotional regulation, and emotional-behavioral problems. We examined the effects of anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC (F3), combined with cathodal tDCS over the right DLPFC (F4) on autism symptom severity as well as theory of mind, emotional regulation, and emotional-behavioral problems of children with ASD. This intervention improved autism symptom severity, specific domains of theory of mind, and emotion regulation. These findings have clinical implications for the treatment of ASD and suggest that targeting core mechanisms underlying socio-cognitive-emotional deficits of autistic children using tDCS might improve symptoms of ASD.","Zemestani Mehdi, Hoseinpanahi Omid, Salehinejad Mohammad Ali, Nitsche Michael A","Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research","Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Child, Emotional Regulation, Humans, Prefrontal Cortex, Theory of Mind, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36069668","Department of Psychology, University of Kurdistan, Sanandaj, Iran.; Department of Psychology and Neurosciences, Leibniz Research Centre for Working Environment and Human Factors, Dortmund, Germany.",

Eighteen subjects with ASD were randomly allocated: six subjects in the control group (Group 1): conventional treatment comprising remedial behavioral therapies and L-carnosine 500 mg per day, and 12 subjects (Group 2) underwent supplementation with Nichi Glucan 0.5 g twice daily along with the conventional treatment for 90 days. Whole genome metagenome (WGM) sequencing of the stool samples at baseline and after intervention showed that among genera of relevance, the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae was decreased almost to zero in Group 2 after intervention, whereas it increased from 0.36% to 0.85% in Group 1. The abundance of Bacteroides increased in Group 1, whereas it decreased in Group 2. The abundance of Prevotella increased while the abundance of Lactobacillus decreased in both Group 1 and Group 2.

These studies mostly demonstrated the acute effects of single-dose administrations, examining task-dependent effects of oxytocin on brain activity elicited during explicit experimental tasks or stimuli presentations. The increased consideration of oxytocin as a potential ameliorating treatment in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) requires a better understanding of how multiple-dose oxytocin administration affects intrinsic, task-free, amygdala function. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with between-subject design, 38 adult men with ASD underwent resting-state fMRI scanning before and after oxytocin or placebo treatment. Effects were assessed either after a single-dose administration, consisting of 24 international units, or after multiple-dose treatment, consisting of 4 weeks of once-daily nasal spray administrations. Compared to placebo, oxytocin induced a decrease in intrinsic resting-state BOLD signal amplitudes of the bilateral amygdala (fractional amplitudes of low-frequency fluctuations) and modulated cross-frequency interactions between adjacent BOLD frequency components. The right amygdala showed a pattern of reduced cross-frequency harmonicity, while the left amygdala showed a relative increase in harmonic cross-frequency interactions after oxytocin treatment. Notably, the direction and magnitude of BOLD spectral changes induced after a single-dose were qualitatively similar to treatment effects induced after multiple-dose treatment. Furthermore, the identified spectral changes in amygdalar BOLD amplitude and cross-frequency harmonicity were associated with improved feelings of tension, reflecting oxytocin's anxiolytic, stress-reducing neuromodulatory role. The observed effects of oxytocin on amygdalar BOLD spectral characteristics and associated behaviors contribute to a deeper mechanistic understanding of the intrinsic, task-free neuromodulatory dynamics that underlie single- and multiple-dose oxytocin treatment in ASD.

Among the hypotheses underlying the involvement of biological and environmental factors, the gut-brain axis is of particular interest in autism spectrum disorders. Several studies have highlighted the related incidence of particular gastrointestinal symptoms (GISs) in children suffering from ASDs. Probiotics have shown success in treating several gastrointestinal dysbiotic disorders; therefore, it is plausible to investigate whether they can alleviate behavioral symptoms as well. On these bases, a randomized double-blind crossover study with a placebo was conducted, evaluating the effects of a mixture of probiotics in a group of 61 subjects aged between 24 months and 16 years old with a diagnosis of ASD. Behavioral evaluation was performed through the administration of a questionnaire including a Parenting Stress Index (PSI) test and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS). The Psycho-Educational Profile and the Autism Spectrum Rating Scale (ASRS) were also evaluated. Microbial composition analyses of fecal samples of the two groups was also performed. The study showed significant improvements in GISs, communication skills, maladaptive behaviors, and perceived parental stress level after the administration of probiotics. Microbiome alpha diversity was comparable between treatment arms and no significant differences were found, although beta diversity results were significantly different in the treatment group between T0 and T1 time points. <i>Streptococcus thermophilus</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i>, <i>Limosilactobacillus fermentum</i>, and <i>Ligilactobacillus salivarius</i> species were identified as some of the most discriminant taxa positively associated with T1 samples.

Cerebellum is best known for its role in controlling motor behaviors; however, recently, there have been significant reports showed that dysfunction in cerebellar-cerebral networks contributes significantly to many of the clinical features of ASD. Hereby, this is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) study examining the potential modulating effects of bilateral anodal tDCS stimulation over cerebellar hemispheres on the resting-state brain complexity in children with ASD. Thirty-six children with ASD (aged 4-14) years old were divided equally and randomly into a tDCS treatment group, which underwent 10 sessions (20-min duration, five sessions/per week) of bilateral anodal tDCS stimulation applied over left and right cerebellar hemispheres, and control group underwent the same procedures, but with sham tDCS stimulation. Resting-state brain complexity was evaluated through recording and calculating the approximate entropy (ApxEnt) values of the resting-state electroencephalograph (EEG) data obtained from a 64-channel EEG system before and after the interventions. Repeated measures of ANOVA showed that tDCS had significant effects on the treatment group (Wilks' Lambda = 0.29, F (15, 16) = 2.67, p = 0.03) compared with the control group. Analyzed data showed a significant increase in the averaged ApxEnt values in the right frontal cortical region (F (1, 16) = 10.46, p = 0.005) after the bilateral cerebellar anodal tDCS stimulation. Besides, the Cohen's d effect size showed a large effect size (0.70-0.92) of bilateral cerebellar anodal tDCS on the ApxEnt values increases in the left and right frontal cortical regions, the right central cortical region, and left parietal cortical region. However, there were no any significant differences or increases in the brain complexity before and after the sham tDCS stimulation of the control group. Bilateral cerebellar anodal tDCS modulated and increased the brain complexity in children with ASD with no any reported adverse effect. Hereby, cerebellum and cerebellar-cerebral circuitry would serve as a promising target for non-invasive brain stimulation and neuro-modulation as a therapeutic intervention.","Hadoush Hikmat, Hadoush Ashraf","Cerebellum (London, England)","Humans, Child, Child, Preschool, Adolescent, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation, Cerebellum, Electroencephalography, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Prefrontal Cortex","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36156195","Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, Jordan University of Science and Technology, P.O.

We searched peer-reviewed international literature to identify clinical trials investigating TMS as a treatment for behavioral and cognitive symptoms of IC-ASD. We identified sixteen studies and were able to conduct a meta-analysis on twelve of these studies. Seven were open-label or used neurotypical controls for baseline cognitive data, and nine were controlled trials. In the latter, waitlist control groups were often used over sham TMS. Only one study conducted a randomized, parallel, double-blind, and sham controlled trial. Favorable safety data was reported in low frequency repetitive TMS, high frequency repetitive TMS, and intermittent theta burst studies. Compared to TMS research of other neuropsychiatric conditions, significantly lower total TMS pulses were delivered in treatment and neuronavigation was not regularly utilized. Quantitatively, our multivariate meta-analysis results report improvement in cognitive outcomes (pooled Hedges' g = 0.735, 95% CI = 0.242, 1.228; p = 0.009) and primarily Criterion B symptomology of IC-ASD (pooled Hedges' g = 0.435, 95% CI = 0.359, 0.511; p < 0.001) with low frequency repetitive TMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The results of our systematic review and meta-analysis data indicate that TMS may offer a promising and safe treatment option for pediatric and young adult patients with IC-ASD.

Sixty-six children with confirmed ASD were allocated to receive either daily 50-mg cilostazol (increased to 100 mg/day after 2 weeks) or matched placebo in addition to risperidone. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Edition (ABC-C) scale and a checklist of probable adverse effects were used to assess the behavioral outcomes and safety profile at weeks 0, 5, and 10 of the study. Sixty-one participants, with comparable baseline characteristics, completed the trial. Unlike other ABC-C subscales, repeated-measures analysis showed significant effect for time × treatment interaction in the hyperactivity subscale ( P = 0.047; partial eta squared = 0.06). We used the median value for the baseline score hyperactivity subscale [median (interquartile range) = 31 (24-37)] to stratify participants to higher hyperactivity and lower hyperactivity subgroups and found that only participants with higher hyperactivity benefit from cilostazol adjunctive therapy ( P = 0.028; partial eta squared = 0.14). Cilostazol could be considered as a safe agent with beneficial effects on hyperactivity in children with ASD and higher levels of hyperactivity.","Ebrahimi Parnia, Seyedmirzaei Homa, Moradi Kamyar, Bagheri Sayna, Moeini Mahdi, Mohammadi Mohammad-Reza, Akhondzadeh Shahin","International clinical psychopharmacology","Child, Humans, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Antipsychotic Agents, Cilostazol, Treatment Outcome, Drug Therapy, Combination, Irritable Mood, Double-Blind Method","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36165508","Interdisciplinary Neuroscience Research Program (INRP), Tehran University of Medical Sciences.; Department of Psychology, Faculty of Psychology and Education, Allameh Tabatabaei University, Tehran, Iran.; Psychiatric Research Center, Roozbeh Psychiatric Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences.",

This post-hoc analysis investigated ""bridge"" symptoms that have cross-sectional and predictive associations with depressive and manic symptom clusters in youth with bipolar depression. The moderating effects of these bridge symptoms on the response to flexibly dosed lurasidone 20-80 mg/d compared to placebo treatment was analyzed in children and adolescents with bipolar I depression in a six-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind study followed by a 2-year, openlabel extension study of lurasidone. Sleep disturbances, assessed by ""difficulty with sleep"" (Children's Depression Rating Scale, Revised [CDRS-R] item 4) and ""decreased need for sleep"" (Young Mania Rating Scale [YMRS] item 4), and ""irritability"" (CDRS-R item-8, YMRS item 5) were identified as ""bridge"" symptoms and found to have replicable causal associations with depressive (CDRS-R total) and manic symptom clusters (YMRS total) at baseline and week-6. A greater improvement in overall depression severity at week 6 with lurasidone (vs. placebo) treatment was observed in the presence (vs. absence) of decreased need for sleep at study baseline, mediated in part by significant reductions from study baseline in decreased need for sleep and manic symptom severity. The absence of sleep disturbance and irritability in patients at open-label extension study baseline was associated with higher rates of sustained recovery (symptomatic and functional remission) over 6 months compared to patients with those symptoms at baseline (68% vs. 50%, Number Needed to Treat=6). Our findings suggest that sleep disturbance and irritability are cardinal symptoms that ""bridge"" between depressive and manic symptom clusters and influence treatment outcomes in youth with bipolar depression.","Singh Manpreet K, Siu Cynthia, Tocco Michael, Pikalov Andrei, Loebel Antony","Current neuropharmacology","Adolescent, Humans, Child, Bipolar Disorder, Lurasidone Hydrochloride, Cross-Sectional Studies, Syndrome, Treatment Outcome, Double-Blind Method, Antipsychotic Agents","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36173066","Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc., 500 Frank W Burr Blvd, Suite 550, Teaneck, NJ, and Marlborough, MA, USA.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; COS and Associates Ltd., Central, Hong Kong, and Toronto, Ontario, Canada.",

However, a gap persists in the literature regarding the potential effects of OT and the neural temporal dynamics due to OT administration. We explored the effect of OT on autistic individuals using magnetoencephalography (MEG), focusing on M100, M170, and M250, social perception-related components that tend to show atypical patterns in autistic individuals. Twenty-five autistic adolescents participated in this randomized, double-blind MEG study. Autistic individuals arrived at the lab twice and received an acute dose of intranasal OT or placebo in each session. During the scans, participants were asked to identify pictures of social and non-social stimuli. Additionally, 23 typically developing (TD) adolescents performed the same task in the MEG as a benchmark that allowed us to better characterize neural regions of interest and behavioral results for this age group in this task. A source-model beamformer analysis revealed that OT enhanced neural activity for social stimuli in frontal regions during M170. Additionally, in each of the preselected time windows, OT increased activation in the left hemisphere, regardless of the content of the presented stimuli. We suggest that OT increased the processing of social stimuli through two separate mechanisms. First, OT increased neural activity in a nonspecific manner, allowing increased allocation of attention toward the stimuli. Second, OT enhanced M170 activity in frontal regions only in response to social stimuli. These results reveal the temporal dynamics of the effects of OT on the early stages of social and non-social perception in autistic adolescents.Trial registration: This study was a part of a project registered as clinical trial October 27th, 2021.

Qualitative data were collected during a large randomised controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of the Sleeping Sound intervention: 123 families were randomised to the intervention group, of which 115 (93%) completed at least one intervention session and 82 (67%) provided qualitative evaluation data in the 3-month follow-up survey. Consultation records from intervention sessions and parent surveys were qualitatively analysed post hoc using a hybrid approach to thematic analysis. Findings were categorised under the seven themes of the TFA (affective attitude, burden, ethicality, intervention coherence, opportunity costs, perceived effectiveness, self-efficacy) in addition to three themes that were defined following inductive and deductive coding (barriers to implementation, facilitators to implementation, suggestions for improvement). Participants spoke positively about their experience participating in the intervention and perceived the intervention to be appropriate and effective. Most parents (95.5%) reported that they would recommend the Sleeping Sound intervention to other families of autistic children. Barriers to implementation included child and parent anxiety, child health problems, parental preferences, family circumstances, and other (e.g., school holidays). Facilitators to implementation included family support and consistency with strategies. The Sleeping Sound intervention was considered acceptable to parents of autistic children as evidenced by largely positive feedback regarding their experience. The results highlighted areas for improvement which can be used to inform future iterations of the intervention.","Pattison Emily, Mantilla Ana, Fuller-Tyszkiewicz Matthew, Marks Deborah, Sciberras Emma, McGillivray Jane, Papadopoulos Nicole, Rinehart Nicole","Sleep medicine","Child, Humans, Autistic Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Parents, Sleep, Surveys and Questionnaires","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36201889","School of Psychology, Faculty of Health, Deakin University, 1 Gheringhap Street, Geelong, Victoria, 3220, Australia; Murdoch Children's Research Institute, 50 Flemington Road, Parkville, Victoria, 3052, Australia; Department of Paediatrics, University of Melbourne, Grattan Street, Parkville, Victoria, 3010, Australia.; Royal Children's Hospital, 50 Flemington Road, Parkville, Victoria, 3052, Australia.; School of Psychology, Faculty of Health, Deakin University, 1 Gheringhap Street, Geelong, Victoria, 3220, Australia.

Step 1 included an open trial of parent-led, therapist-guided bibliotherapy. Step 2 was family-based CBT for those who did not respond to Step 1 or maintenance for those who did. Eighteen participants (28%) who completed Step 1 responded. Responders reported significantly lower pre-treatment anxiety, internalizing symptoms, and functional impairment than non-responders. After Steps 1 and 2, 80% of completers (55% intent-to-treat) were responders. Anxiety, impairment, and ASD-related impairments significantly improved. Youth in maintenance experienced faster improvement through post-treatment, though there were no group differences at 3-month-follow-up. A stepped approach may help some individuals in Step 1, particularly those who are less anxious.","Storch Eric A, Schneider Sophie C, Olsen Sean M, Ramirez Ana C, Berry Leandra N, Goin-Kochel Robin P,

"36245883","10.3389/Fpsyt.2022.977341","Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for insomnia in patients with autism spectrum disorder: Study protocol for a randomized, double-blind, and sham-controlled clinical trial.","2022-01-01","Insomnia is the most common comorbidity in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and seriously affects their rehabilitation and prognosis. Thus, an intervention targeting insomnia in ASD seems warranted. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a potentially effective treatment for improving sleep quality and optimizing sleep structure, has already been demonstrated to alleviate insomnia symptoms and sleep disturbance in different neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions. This trial aims to investigate the effects of rTMS on insomnia in patients with ASD. This study is designed to be a double-blind, randomized, and sham-controlled trial with a target sample size of 30 participants (aged 3-13 years) diagnosed with ASD comorbid with insomnia. The intervention phase will comprise 20 sessions of rTMS or sham rTMS applied over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) within four consecutive weeks. The effect of rTMS on insomnia and other symptoms of ASD will be investigated through home-PSG (two consecutive overnights), sleep diary, CSHQ, CARS, ABC, SRS, RBS-R, and metabolomics analysis at baseline and posttreatment. A follow-up assessment 1 month after the intervention will examine the long-term effects. The results of this study may address an important knowledge gap and may provide evidence for the use of rTMS to treat insomnia in ASD. Furthermore, it will elucidate the potential mechanism and link between sleep disorders and clinical symptoms.

"36256600","10.1093/Brain/Awac380","Randomized placebo-controlled crossover trial of memantine in children with epileptic encephalopathy.","2023-03-01","Memantine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, approved for dementia treatment. There is limited evidence of memantine showing benefit for paediatric neurodevelopmental phenotypes, but no randomized placebo-controlled trials in children with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial (Trial registration: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03779672), patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy received memantine and placebo, each for a 6-week period separated by a 2-week washout phase. Electroencephalography, seizure diary, patient caregivers' global impression, serum inflammatory markers and neuropsychological evaluation were performed at baseline and after each treatment phase. The primary outcome measure was classification as a 'responder', defined as ≥2 of: >50% seizure frequency reduction, electroencephalography improvement, caregiver clinical impression improvement or clear neuropsychological testing improvement. Thirty-one patients (13 females) enrolled. Two patients withdrew prior to initiating medication and two (twins) had to be removed from analysis. Of the remaining 27 patients, nine (33%) were classified as responders to memantine versus two (7%) in the placebo group (P < 0.02). Electroencephalography improvement was seen in eight patients on memantine compared to two on placebo (P < 0.04). Seizure improvement was observed in eight patients on memantine and two on placebo (P < 0.04). Caregivers reported overall clinical improvement in 10 patients on memantine compared to seven on placebo (not significant). Statistical analysis of neuropsychological evaluation suggested improvements in symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism. Memantine is a safe and effective treatment for children with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, having the potential to improve both seizure control and cognitive function.","Schiller Katharina, Berrahmoune Saoussen, Dassi Christelle, Corriveau Isabelle, Ayash Taghreed A, Osterman Bradley, Poulin Chantal, Shevell Michael I, Simard-Tremblay Elisabeth, Sébire Guillaume, Myers Kenneth A","Brain : a journal of neurology","Female, Humans, Memantine, Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists, Cross-Over Studies, Treatment Outcome, Seizures, Epilepsy, Generalized, Double-Blind Method","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36256600","Child Health and Human Development, Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC H4A 3J1, Canada.; Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreal, QC H3A 2B4, Canada.; Division of Neurology, Department of Pediatrics, Montreal Children's Hospital, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC H4A 3J1, Canada.; Department of Psychology, Montreal Children's Hospital, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC H4A 3J1, Canada.",
"36279220","10.1037/Ccp0000755","Change during cognitive and exposure phases of cognitive-behavioral therapy for autistic youth with anxiety disorders.","2022-09-01","To evaluate improvement during the (a) cognitive and (b) exposure therapy phases of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for autistic youth with anxiety disorders. Participants were 148 autistic youth (aged 7-13; 77% male; 64% White) with clinically significant anxiety who were randomized to standard or adapted CBT. Clinician-rated anxiety severity was recorded at each appointment. Trajectories of change during (a) the cognitive phase and (b) the exposure phase of treatment were analyzed using piecewise multilevel modeling. Compared to the psychoeducation and cognitive therapy phases, the exposure phase corresponded with significantly more rapid symptom reduction, b = -.11, 95% CI [-.13, -.071]. This finding was true for standard CBT, which included nine sessions prior to exposure initiation (on average), as well as for CBT personalized for autistic youth, which introduced exposure following the fifth session (on average). In contrast, compared with improvements during initial psychoeducation sessions, the introduction of cognitive skills corresponded with significantly slower symptom reduction, b = .066, 95% CI [.020, .11]. This finding was also true for both adapted and standard CBT. Results underscore the central role of exposure in the treatment of anxiety among autistic youth and question the utility of cognitive strategies without subsequent practice of these skills during exposure. Assuming a working relationship, therapists should consider moving through the preexposure coping phase of CBT quickly. Future research should evaluate the extent to which exposure can maintain its potency while minimizing coping skill preparation.

"36282407","10.1007/S11517-022-02693-Y","Impact of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on the directed connectivity of autism EEG signals: a pilot study.","2022-12-01","To compare the differences in directed connectivity between typically developing (TD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) children and identify the potential effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on brain connectivity and behavior of children with ASD; 26 TD children (18 males/8 females; the average age was 6.34 ± 0.45) and 30 ASD children (21 males/9 females; the average age was 6.42 ± 0.17) participated in the experiment. ASD children were divided randomly into an experimental group and a control group. The experimental group received 18 rTMS sessions (twice a week for nine weeks), whereas the control group received the same procedures with sham stimulation. Directed transfer function (DTF) was used to calculate the effective connectivity as a way of investigating differences between ASD and TD children while simultaneously evaluating the effectiveness of rTMS for ASD. The results illustrate that the DTF of TD children in the frontal lobe (Fp1, Fp2, F7, F8) and temporal lobe (T7, T8) is higher than that of ASD children in all frequency bands; however, the DTF of ASD children is higher than TD in the midline (Fz, Cz), central lobe (C3, C4), and parietal lobe (P3, P4). In the experimental group of ASD children, the effective connectivity decreased from O1 to T7 and from P7 to Fp1 in the alpha band and from Pz to T8 in the gamma band after stimulation. Significant changes in Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) scores were also found in social behaviors. Effective connectivity derived from DTF distinguishes ASD from TD children. rTMS provides changes in connectivity and behavior, suggesting its potential use as a viable treatment option for ASD individuals.","Kang Jiannan, Li Xiaoli, Casanova Manuel F, Sokhadze Estate M, Geng Xinling","Medical & biological engineering & computing","Child, Male, Female, Humans, Child, Preschool, Transcranial

"36291419","10.3390/Children9101483","Managing Autism Spectrum Disorder in the Face of Pandemic Using Internet-Based Parent-Mediated Interventions: A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials.","2022-09-28","ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is primarily treated with psychosocial intervention. However, it is costly and requires extensive resources to be effective. This inaccessibility is also further worsened by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, making the shift to a digital approach a sensible option. Among the available ASD therapies, parent-mediated interventions (PMIs) have a broad application and lower implementation cost. Hence, this systematic review aims to evaluate the potential that telehealth-based PMI holds and explore its feasibility throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. To build up this study, a systematic search through PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, Wiley, and Cochrane was performed until 14 January 2021. Using the preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines, we ultimately included six studies in the review. Each study was evaluated utilizing the Cochrane Risk of Bias (ROB)-2 tool. Generally, parents' outcomes (knowledge, satisfaction, and compliance) were higher in intervention group (E-learning) compared to control (standard treatment or wait-list). Children also showed some improvements in social skill, communication skill, and intelligence after receiving the treatment. In addition, coaching or therapist sessions were found to be crucial as adjuvant to support parents during the intervention. In conclusion, internet-based parent-mediated interventions are promising and recommended for managing ASD patients, in the face of pandemic. However, more variety in study locations is also needed, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, to tackle the knowledge and clinical application gap. Further research should be conducted with a uniform measurement tool to achieve the same perception and reliable pooled analysis.","Yosep Iyus, Prayogo Stephanie Amabella, Kohar Kelvin, Andrew Hubert,

While oxytocin has a crucial role in mammalian social development, its potential role as a medication to enhance social development in humans remains unclear. We investigated the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of intranasal oxytocin in young children with autism using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial, following a placebo lead-in phase. A total of 87 children (aged between 3 and 12 years) with autism received 16 International Units (IU) of oxytocin (n = 45) or placebo (n = 42) nasal spray, morning and night (32 IU per day) for twelve weeks, following a 3-week placebo lead-in phase. Overall, there was no effect of oxytocin treatment over time on the caregiver-rated Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2) (p = 0.686). However, a significant interaction with age (p = 0.028) showed that for younger children, aged 3-5 years, there was some indication of a treatment effect. Younger children who received oxytocin showed improvement on caregiver-rated social responsiveness ( SRS-2). There was no other evidence of benefit in the sample as a whole, or in the younger age group, on the clinician-rated Clinical Global Improvement Scale (CGI-S), or any secondary measure. Importantly, placebo effects in the lead-in phase were evident and there was support for washout of the placebo response in the randomised phase. Oxytocin was well tolerated, with more adverse side effects reported in the placebo group. This study suggests the need for further clinical trials to test the benefits of oxytocin treatment in younger populations with autism.Trial registration www.anzctr.org.au (ACTRN12617000441314).","Guastella Adam J, Boulton Kelsie A, Whitehouse Andrew J O, Song Yun Ju, Thapa Rinku, Gregory Simon G, Pokorski Izabella, Granich Joanna, DeMayo Marilena M, Ambarchi Zahava, Wray John, Thomas Emma E, Hickie Ian B","Molecular psychiatry","Child, Child, Preschool, Humans, Administration, Intranasal, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Double-Blind Method, Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions, Nasal Sprays, Oxytocin, Social Interaction, Treatment Outcome","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36302965","Child and Adolescent Health Service, Child Development Service, West Perth, WA, Australia.; Clinic for Autism and Neurodevelopment (CAN) Research, Brain and Mind Centre, Children's Hospital Westmead Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.; Department of Neurology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC, USA.; Clinic for Autism and Neurodevelopment (CAN) Research, Brain and Mind Centre, Children's Hospital Westmead Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW, Australia. adam.guastella@sydney.edu.au.; Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia.",

GABAergic dysregulation underlies working memory impairments seen in NF1. This mechanistic experimental study investigates whether application of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS) can modulate GABA and working memory in NF1. Thirty-one NF1 adolescents 11-18 years, were recruited to this single-blind sham-controlled cross-over randomized trial. AtDCS or sham stimulation was applied to the left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) and MR Spectroscopy was collected before and after intervention in the left DLPFC and occipital cortex. Task-related functional MRI was collected before, during, and after stimulation. Higher baseline GABA+ in the left DLPFC was associated with faster response times on baseline working memory measures. AtDCS was seen to significantly reduced GABA+ and increase brain activation in the left DLPFC as compared to sham stimulation. Task performance was worse in the aTDCS group during stimulation but no group differences in behavioural outcomes were observed at the end of stimulation. Although our study suggests aTDCS modulates inhibitory activity in the DLPFC, further work is needed to determine whether repeated sessions of atDCS and strategies such as alternating current stimulation offer a better therapeutic approach.","Garg Shruti, Williams Steve, Jung JeYoung, Pobric Gorana, Nandi Tulika, Lim Ben, Vassallo Grace, Green Jonathan, Evans D Gareth, Stagg Charlotte J, Parkes Laura M, Stivaros Stavros","Scientific reports","Humans, Brain, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid, Neurofibromatosis 1, Prefrontal Cortex, Single-Blind Method, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36316421","Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK.; Division of Neuroscience and Experimental Psychology, School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.; Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; School of Psychology, Precision Imaging Beacon, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.; Division of Neuroscience and Experimental Psychology, School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.

As intranasal oxytocin has been shown to modulate activation of the brain's reward circuit, oxytocin might ameliorate the processing of social rewards in ASD and thus improve social difficulties. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we examined effects of a 24-IU dose of intranasal oxytocin on reward-related brain function in 37 men with ASD without intellectual impairment and 37 age- and IQ-matched control participants. Participants performed an incentive delay task that allows the investigation of neural activity associated with the anticipation and receipt of monetary and social rewards. Nonsignificant tests suggested that oxytocin did not influence neural processes related to the anticipation of social or monetary rewards in either group. Complementary Bayesian analyses indicated moderate evidence for a null model, relative to an alternative model. Our results were inconclusive regarding possible oxytocin effects on amygdala responsiveness to social rewards during reward consumption. There were no significant differences in reward-related brain function between the two groups under placebo. Our results do not support the hypothesis that intranasal oxytocin generally enhances activation of reward-related neural circuits in men with and without ASD.","Mayer Annalina V, Preckel Katrin, Ihle Kristin, Piecha Fabian A, Junghanns Klaus, Reiche Stefan, Rademacher Lena, Müller-Pinzler Laura, Stolz David S, Kamp-Becker Inge, Stroth Sanna, Roepke Stefan, Küpper Charlotte, Engert Veronika, Singer Tania, Kanske Philipp, Paulus Frieder M, Krach Sören","Biological psychiatry global open science",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36325162","Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Berlin, Germany.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy, Philipps University of Marburg, Marburg, Germany.; Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Leipzig, Germany.; Social Neuroscience Lab, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Lübeck, Lübeck, Germany.; Social Neuroscience Lab, Max Planck Society, Berlin, Germany.; Social Cognition Group, Berlin School of Mind and Brain, Department of Psychology, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany.; Translational Psychiatry Unit, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Lübeck, Lübeck, Germany.",

Data from four double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (sertraline and fluvoxamine for anxiety disorders, risperidone for autistic disorder, and fluoxetine for major depressive disorder) in children and adolescents funded by the National Institute of Mental Health were used. The response was defined as a score of 1 or 2 on the Clinical Global Impression-Global Improvement (CGI-I) at the endpoint. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate associations between response status and the following variables: sex, diagnosis, treatment allocation, and CGI-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) score at baseline. Moreover, the presence of early improvement (a score of ≤3 in the CGI-I) at Week 1 was added to the independent variables in an additional binary logistic regression analysis, using the data from two studies. A total of 599 patients were included in the analysis. In the binary logistic regression analysis, active drug use (odds ratio [OR] = 8.64, P < 0.001) and female sex (OR = 1.89, P = 0.002) were significantly associated with treatment response.

Thirty-six male children with ASD (mean age 2 years 3 months, SD 4 months, age range 1 years 6 months-2 years 11 months) were balanced and stratified by age, sex, and baseline severity of ASD, to: (1) a control group that received 20 sessions of sham tDCS; (2) a 5-session tDCS group (5-tDCS) that received 5 sessions of active tDCS followed by 15 sessions of sham tDCS; and (3) a 20-session tDCS group (20-tDCS) that received 20 sessions of active tDCS. All groups participated in the special school activity of Khon Kaen Special Education Center, Thailand. The primary outcome was autism severity as measured by the Childhood Autism Severity Scale. The 5-tDCS and 20-tDCS groups evidenced greater reductions in autism severity than the control group at days 5 and 14, and months 6 and 12. There were no significant differences in the outcome between the 5- and 20-tDCS groups at any time point. Within-group analysis showed clinically meaningful improvements starting at month 6 for the participants in the control group, and clinically meaningful improvements starting on day 5 in both active tDCS groups, all of which were maintained to month 12. The 5- and 20-session tDCS seems to reduce autism severity faster than sham tDCS. These effects maintained at least for 1 year. Twenty sessions of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) were not superior to five sessions. Sham tDCS with a special school activity can reduce autism severity starting at 6 months after treatment. The benefits observed for 5 and 20 sessions of tDCS last for at least 12 months.","Auvichayapat Paradee, Intayot Krittiya, Udomchat Chavisa, Suphakunpinyo Chanyut, Patjanasoontorn Niramol, Keeratitanont Keattichai, Tunkamnerdthai Orathai, Jensen Mark P, Humbert Andrew T, Auvichayapat Narong","Developmental medicine and child neurology","Child, Humans, Male, Infant, Child, Preschool, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Thailand, Autistic Disorder, Double-Blind Method","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36394093","Noninvasive Brain Stimulation Research Group of Thailand, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.; Khon Kaen Special Education Center Region 9, Khon Kaen, Thailand.; Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.",

Autistic children (5-13 years) with sleep problems were randomised to the Sleeping Sound intervention or Treatment as Usual (TAU). At 12-month follow-up (n = 150), caregivers of children in the Sleeping Sound group reported greater reduction in child sleep problems compared to TAU (p < .001, effect size: - 0.4). The long-term benefits of the intervention were greater for children taking sleep medication, children of parents who were not experiencing psychological distress, and children with greater autism severity. The Sleeping Sound intervention demonstrated sustained improvements in child sleep. Identified moderators may inform treatment by indicating which subgroups may benefit from further support.","Pattison Emily, Papadopoulos Nicole, Fuller-Tyszkiewicz Matthew, Sciberras Emma, Hiscock

"36417403","10.1371/Journal.Pone.0277398","Preliminary efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy on emotion regulation in adults with autism spectrum disorder: A pilot randomized waitlist-controlled study.","2022-01-01","Previous studies have demonstrated the clinical utility of cognitive-behavioral therapy in improving emotion regulation in children on the autism spectrum. However, no studies have elucidated the clinical utility of cognitive-behavioral therapy in improving emotion regulation in autistic adults. The aim of the present pilot study was to explore the preliminary clinical utility of a group-based cognitive-behavioral therapy program designed to address emotion regulation skills in autistic adults. We conducted a clinical trial based on a previously reported protocol; 31 participants were randomly allocated to the intervention group and 29 to the waitlist control group. The intervention group underwent an 8-week program of cognitive-behavioral therapy sessions. Two participants from the intervention group withdrew from the study, leaving 29 participants (93.5%) in the group. Compared with the waitlist group, the cognitive-behavioral therapy group exhibited significantly greater pre-to-post (Week 0-8) intervention score improvements on the attitude scale of the autism spectrum disorder knowledge and attitude quiz (t = 2.21, p = 0.03, d = 0.59) and the difficulty describing feelings scale of the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (t = -2.07, p = 0.04, d = -0.57) in addition to pre-to-follow-up (Week 0-16) score improvements on the emotion-oriented scale of the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (t = -2.14, p = 0.04, d = -0.59). Our study thus provides preliminary evidence of the efficacy of the group-based cognitive-behavioral therapy program on emotion regulation in autistic adults, thereby supporting further evaluation of the effectiveness of the cognitive-behavioral therapy program in the context of a larger randomized clinical trial. However, the modest and inconsistent effects underscore the importance of continued efforts to improve the cognitive-behavioral therapy program beyond current standards.","Kuroda Miho, Kawakubo Yuki,

Here we present results of a larger randomized clinical trial (N = 108) in China. There were no significant changes in caregiver rated scales between sulforaphane and placebo groups. However, clinician rated scales showed a significant improvement in the sulforaphane group, and one third of participants showed at least a 30% decrease in score by 12 weeks treatment. The effects of sulforaphane were seen across the full range of intelligence and greater in participants over 10 years. Sulforaphane was safe and well-tolerated even for young children. The inconsistent results between caregiver and clinician rated scales suggest more clinical trials are needed to confirm our findings.","Ou Jianjun, Smith Robert C, Tobe Russell H, Lin Jingjing, Arriaza Jen, Fahey Jed W, Liu Ruiting, Zeng Ying, Liu Yanan, Huang Lian, Shen Yidong, Li Yamin, Cheng Daomeng, Cornblatt Brian, Davis John M, Zhao Jingping, Wu Renrong, Jin Hua","Journal of autism and developmental disorders","Child, Humans, Child, Preschool, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Treatment Outcome, Isothiocyanates, Sulfoxides, Double-Blind Method","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36427174","The Affiliated Brain Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510370, Guangdong, China.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Illinois, Psychiatric Institute, Chicago, IL, USA.; Departments of Medicine, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and Pharmacology & Molecular Sciences, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, National Clinical Research Center for Mental Disorders, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Middle Renmin Road, Changsha, 410011, Hunan, China.; Department of Psychiatry, National Clinical Research Center for Mental Disorders, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Middle Renmin Road, Changsha, 410011, Hunan, China. wurenrong@csu.edu.cn.; Department of Psychiatry, National Clinical Research Center for Mental Disorders, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Middle Renmin Road, Changsha, 410011, Hunan, China. zhaojingping@csu.edu.cn.; School of Professional Studies, New York University, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, University of California San Diego and Psychiatric Service, VA San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, CA, USA. hjin@health.ucsd.edu.; Nathan S.

Physical activity (PA) may interact with vitamin D on sarcopenia. However, the sex-specific relationships of vitamin D, PA and sarcopenia have yet elucidated. We aimed to examine the sex differences in the relation between vitamin D status, PA levels, obesity and sarcopenia in community-dwelling middle-aged and older adults, as well as whether vitamin D status is a modifier in the relationship between PA and sarcopenia. The current study was a cross-sectional study based on the baseline survey of the West China Health and Aging Trend (WCHAT) study. A total of 3713 participants aged ≥ 50y were included in our study. Sarcopenia was defined according to the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) 2019 consensus. Obesity was defined by body mass index (BMI) (≥ 28 kg/m2) and body fat mass percentage (≥ 60th percentile in each sex group). 25-hydroxyvitamin D was measured by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay and PA was evaluated by a validated China Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire (CLTPAQ). Multinomial logistic regression was performed to examine the relationship between PA, vitamin D and sarcopenia and obesity. Low PA was significantly associated with higher odds of sarcopenia in women only (OR = 1.70,95%CI:1.18,2.46, p < 0.01). Vitamin D deficiency was only associated with sarcopenia in men (OR = 1.85,95%CI: 1.27,2.69, p < 0.01). Low PA was significantly associated with obesity, sarcopenia, and sarcopenic obesity only in participants with serum 25(OH)D < 20 ng/ml. The role of vitamin D and PA in obesity and sarcopenia was different between men and women, and the relationship between PA and sarcopenia was modified by serum vitamin D status. These findings highlighted the need to supplement vitamin D in individuals with physical inactivity and provide different interventions strategies to sarcopenia in men and women.

The latest non-intrusive brain stimulation (NIBS) technology-transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS)-has been proven effective in older adults with mild neurocognitive disorders and adults with major depressive disorder. Nonetheless, there is so far no robust randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted on adolescents with ASD nationwide. This study proposes a two-armed (verum TPS group vs. sham TPS group), double-blinded, randomized, sham-controlled trial. Both groups will be measured at four timepoints, namely, baseline (T1), 2 weeks immediately after post-TPS intervention (T2), and at the 1-month (T3) and 3-month (T4) follow-ups. Thirty-four subjects, aged between 12 and 17, diagnosed with ASD will be recruited in this study. All subjects will be computerized randomised into the verum TPS group or the sham TPS group on a 1:1 ratio. All subjects will undertake functional MRI (fMRI) before and after the 2-weeks TPS interventions, which will be completed in 2 weeks' time. This will be the first RCT evaluating the efficacy of TPS adolescents with ASD in Hong Kong.

However, mental health programs that are suited for autistic adults are few. Acceptance and commitment therapy is a psychotherapy method that seems to help people feel better, although not thoroughly evaluated in autistic individuals. In this study, 20 autistic adults had 14 weeks of acceptance and commitment therapy group treatment suited for autism (NeuroACT), while 19 autistic adults had ordinary care. The acceptance and commitment therapy group treatment program seemed logical and reasonable to the participants. Also, when comparing the participants in the NeuroACT group with those in the ordinary care group, the NeuroACT participants reported less stress and higher quality of life. Compared to the ordinary care group, they could also manage distressing thoughts better, perceived themselves as more flexible, and did not avoid stressful situations as much as before. However, there was no significant difference between the groups in depression, anxiety, sleep problems, social aspects of autism, everyday functioning, or executive challenges. Slightly more NeuroACT participants did not finish the treatment than ordinary care participants. In conclusion, the NeuroACT program may be a treatment for autistic adults who feel stressed and have reduced quality of life. More studies are needed to see how helpful the NeuroACT program is for autistic adults.","Pahnke Johan, Jansson-Fröjmark Markus, Andersson Gerhard, Bjureberg Johan, Jokinen Jussi, Bohman Benjamin,

This study examined AO in children with autism and anxiety by evaluating clinical characteristics, family accommodation, and changes in AO following anxiety-focused treatment. The sample comprised 167 youth with autism and anxiety enrolled in a multi-site randomized clinical trial comparing standard care CBT for anxiety, CBT adapted for youth with autism, and usual care. Most participants (60%) had AO, which contributed to impairment above and beyond anxiety and autism. AO impacted functional impairment indirectly through a pathway of parental accommodation. AO reduced with anxiety-focused treatment. Findings highlight that AO are common in this population and uniquely contribute to functional impairment, indicating a need for direct targeting in treatment.","Townsend Allie N, Guzick Andrew G, Hertz Alyssa G, Kerns Connor M, Goodman Wayne K, Berry Leandra N, Kendall Philip C, Wood Jeffrey J, Storch Eric A","Child psychiatry and human development","Humans, Male, Female, Child, Adolescent, Anger, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Anxiety Disorders, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Family, Anxiety","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36576640","Department of Psychology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Baylor College of Medicine, 1977 Butler Blvd, Houston, TX, USA.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Baylor College of Medicine, 1977 Butler Blvd, Houston, TX, USA.

Clinical trials of the efficacy of OT in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have reported mixed results due in part to ASD's complex etiology. We investigated whether genetic and epigenetic variation contribute to variable endogenous OT levels that modulate sensitivity to OT therapy. To carry out this analysis, we integrated genome-wide profiles of DNA-methylation, transcriptional activity, and genetic variation with plasma OT levels in 290 participants with ASD enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of OT. Our analysis identified genetic variants with novel association with plasma OT, several of which reside in known ASD risk genes. We also show subtle but statistically significant association of plasma OT levels with peripheral transcriptional activity and DNA-methylation profiles across several annotated gene sets. These findings broaden our understanding of the effects of the peripheral oxytocin system and provide novel genetic candidates for future studies to decode the complex etiology of ASD and its interaction with OT signaling and OT-based interventions. LAY SUMMARY: Oxytocin (OT) is an abundant chemical produced by neurons that plays an important role in social interaction and motivation. We investigated whether genetic and epigenetic factors contribute to variable OT levels in the blood. To this, we integrated genetic, gene expression, and non-DNA regulated (epigenetic) signatures with blood OT levels in 290 participants with autism enrolled in an OT clinical trial. We identified genetic association with plasma OT, several of which reside in known autism risk genes. We also show statistically significant association of plasma OT levels with gene expression and epigenetic across several gene pathways. These findings broaden our understanding of the factors that influence OT levels in the blood for future studies to decode the complex presentation of autism and its interaction with OT and OT-based treatment.","Siecinski Stephen K, Giamberardino Stephanie N, Spanos Marina, Hauser Annalise C, Gibson Jason R, Chandrasekhar Tara, Trelles Maria Del Pilar, Rockhill Carol M, Palumbo Michelle L, Cundiff Allyson Witters, Montgomery Alicia, Siper Paige, Minjarez Mendy, Nowinski Lisa A, Marler Sarah, Kwee Lydia C, Shuffrey Lauren C, Alderman Cheryl, Weissman Jordana, Zappone Brooke, Mullett Jennifer E, Crosson Hope, Hong Natalie, Luo Sheng, She Lilin, Bhapkar Manjushri, Dean Russell, Scheer Abby, Johnson Jacqueline L, King Bryan H, McDougle Christopher J, Sanders Kevin B, Kim Soo-Jeong, Kolevzon Alexander, Veenstra-VanderWeele Jeremy, Hauser Elizabeth R, Sikich Linmarie, Gregory Simon G","Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research","Humans, Child, Adolescent, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Oxytocin, Autistic Disorder, DNA Methylation, Epigenesis, Genetic","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36609850","Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Seattle Children's Hospital and the University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.; Duke Molecular Physiology Institute, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Duke Clinical Research Institute, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.",

Children with IQ ≥ 70 were analyzed for baseline deficits and treatment-effects on the intention-to-treat-population with generalized-linear-models, principal component analysis and network analysis. Ninety-two children were allocated to treatment and 83 eligible for analyses. Heterogeneous neurocognitive impairments were found that were unaffected by bumetanide treatment. Network analysis showed higher modularity after treatment (mean difference:-0.165, 95%CI:-0.317 to - 0.013,p = .034) and changes in the relative importance of response inhibition in the neurocognitive network (mean difference:-0.037, 95%CI:-0.073 to - 0.001,p = .042).

Participants were randomized and blindly received active or sham iTBS for 4 weeks (the single-blind sham-controlled phase). Then, all participants continued to receive active iTBS for another 4 weeks (the open-label phase). The clinical results were published elsewhere. Here, we present diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data on potential changes in white matter measures after iTBS. Twenty-two participants in Active-Active group and 27 participants in Sham-Active group underwent multi-shell high angular resolution diffusion imaging (64-direction for b = 2000 & 1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>, respectively) at baseline, week 4, and week 8. With longitudinal fixel-based analysis, we found no white matter changes following iTBS from baseline to week 4 (a null treatment by time interaction and a null within-group paired comparison in the Active-Active group), nor from baseline to week 8 (null within-group paired comparisons in both Active-Active and Sham-Active groups). As for the brain-symptoms relationship, we did not find baseline white matter metrics associated with symptom changes at week 4 in either group. Our results raise the question of what the minimal cumulative stimulation dose required to induce the white matter plasticity is.","Ni Hsing-Chang, Chao Yi-Ping, Tseng Rung-Yu, Wu Chen-Te, Cocchi Luca, Chou Tai-Li, Chen Rou-Shayn, Gau Susan Shur-Fen, Yeh Chun-Hung, Lin Hsiang-Yuan","NeuroImage.

A total of 120 children were enrolled into the study and randomly assigned to either 0.5 mg bumetanide or placebo. In the final sample, 119 children received at least one dose of bumetanide (59 children) or placebo (60 children) were included in the final analysis. The primary outcome was a reduction in the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) score, and the secondary outcomes were the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI) -Global Improvement (CGI-I) score at 3 months and the change from baseline to 3-month in the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to measure γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate neurotransmitter concentrations in the insular cortex (IC) before and after the treatment. As compared with the placebo, bumetanide treatment was significantly better in reducing the severity. No patient withdrew from the trial due to adverse events. The superiority of bumetanide to placebo in reducing insular GABA, measured using MRS, was demonstrated. The clinical improvement was associated with a decrease in insular GABA in the bumetanide group. In conclusion, this trial in a large group of young children with predominantly moderate and severe ASD demonstrated that bumetanide is safe and effective in improving the core symptoms of ASD. However, the clinical significance remains uncertain, and future multi-center clinical trials are required to replicate these findings and confirm the clinical significance using a variety of outcome measures.","Dai Yuan, Zhang Lingli, Yu Juehua, Zhou Xin, He Hua, Ji Yiting, Wang Kai, Du Xiujuan, Liu Xin, Tang Yun, Deng Shining, Langley Christelle, Li Wei-Guang, Zhang Jun, Feng Jianfeng, Sahakian Barbara J, Luo Qiang, Li Fei","Science bulletin","Humans, Child, Child, Preschool, Bumetanide, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Glutamic Acid, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36654288","Institute of Science and Technology for Brain-Inspired Intelligence, Ministry of Education-Key Laboratory of Computational Neuroscience and Brain-Inspired Intelligence and Research and Research Institute of Intelligent Complex Systems, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China; State Key Laboratory of Medical Neurobiology and Ministry of Education Frontiers Center for Brain Science, Institutes of Brain Science and National Clinical Research Center for Aging and Medicine, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200040, China.

Sulforaphane (SFN), an isothiocyanate abundant in the seeds and sprouts of cruciferous vegetables, has been shown to be effective in alleviating autistic behaviour. We performed a prospective double-blind placebo-controlled study to examine the possible effect of SFN in a paediatric cohort aged three to seven years based on measurements of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 (ADOS-2), the Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2), and the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist (ABC). The study consisted of three visits over the duration of 36 weeks (baseline, 18 weeks, and 36 weeks). Twenty-eight of the 40 randomized children completed the study. The mean total raw scores on ABC and SRS-2 improved in both groups, but none of the changes reached statistical significance (ABC: 0 weeks <i>p</i> = 0.2742, 18 weeks <i>p</i> = 0.4352, and 36 weeks 0.576; SRS-2: 0 weeks <i>p</i> = 0.5235, 18 weeks <i>p</i> = 0.9176, and 36 weeks 0.7435).

Two multilevel mediation analyses were run which examined the mediating role of changes in anxiety for changes in two core features of autism, (a) repetitive and restrictive behaviors (RRBs) and (b) social communication/interaction impairments, between pre- and post-treatment. Indirect effects between time and autism characteristics were significant for both models, indicating that as anxiety changes, so do RRBs and social communication/interaction as the outcomes respectively. Findings suggest a bidirectional relationship between anxiety and autism features.

"36901415","10.3390/Ijerph20054406","Third-Generation Behavioural Therapies in the Context of Neurodevelopmental Problems and Intellectual Disabilities: A Randomised Clinical Trial with Parents.","2023-03-01","The purpose of this study was to examine how 14 parents of children with autism and intellectual impairments responded to an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)-based psychological flexibility intervention programme. A randomised clinical trial was conducted. Parents were randomly assigned to the training programme group (<i>n</i> = 8) or waiting list group (<i>n</i> = 6). The treatment effect was measured using the 6-PAQ, PSS-14, GHQ-12, and WBSI questionnaires. Changes in interactions were assessed through self-recording, including a baseline to observe the previous functioning. Measures were taken before and after the application of the intervention programme and three months later. After that, the control group was switched to the psychological flexibility programme condition. After the programme's implementation, we could see a reduction in stress and the tendency to suppress unwanted private events. The impacts also appeared to apply to family interactions, resulting in a rise in positive interactions and a decrease in unfavourable ones. The results led us to think about the importance of psychological flexibility for the parents of children with chronic conditions, facilitating a reduction in the emotional impact derived from parenting and the emission of behaviours that promote the harmonious development of the diagnosed child.","Lobato David, Montesinos Francisco, Polín Eduardo, Cáliz Saray","International journal of

"36990468","10.1503/Jpn.220159","Distinct and shared therapeutic neural mechanisms of mindfulness-based and social support stress reduction groups in adults with autism spectrum disorder.","2023-01-01","Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) alleviates depression and anxiety in adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD); however, underlying therapeutic neural mechanisms and mindfulness-specific effects have yet to be elucidated. We randomly assigned adults with ASD to MBSR or social support/education (SE). They completed questionnaires that assessed depression, anxiety, mindfulness traits, autistic traits and executive functioning abilities as well as a self-reflection functional MRI task. We used repeated-measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to evaluate behavioural changes. To identify task-specific connectivity changes, we performed a generalized psychophysiological interactions (gPPI) functional connectivity (FC) analysis on regions of interest (ROIs; insula, amygdala, cingulum and prefrontal cortex [PFC]). We used Pearson correlations to explore brain-behaviour relationships. Our final sample included 78 adults with ASD - 39 who received MBSR and 39 who received SE. Mindfulness-based stress reduction uniquely improved executive functioning abilities and increased mindfulness traits, whereas both MBSR and SE groups showed reductions in depression, anxiety and autistic traits. Decreases specific to MBSR in insula-thalamus FC were associated with anxiety reduction and increased mindfulness traits, including the trait ""nonjudgment;"" MBSR-specific decreases in PFC-posterior cingulate connectivity correlated with improved working memory. Both groups showed decreased amygdala-sensorimotor and medial-lateral PFC connectivity, which corresponded with reduced depression. Larger sample sizes and neuropsychological evaluations are needed to replicate and extend these findings. Together, our findings suggest that MBSR and SE are similarly efficacious for depression, anxiety and autistic traits, whereas MBSR produced additional salutary effects related to executive functioning and mindfulness traits. Findings from gPPI identified shared and distinct therapeutic neural mechanisms, implicating the default mode and salience networks. Our results mark an early step toward the development of personalized medicine for psychiatric symptoms in ASD and offer novel neural targets for future neurostimulation research.

Individuals with ASD, which includes about 2% of the US population, have challenges with activities of daily living and suffer from comorbid medical and mental health concerns. There are no drugs indicated for the core impairments of ASD. As such, there is a significant need for the development of new medication strategies for individuals with ASD. This first-in-human placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study investigated the safety (primary objective) and efficacy of oral SB-121, a combination of L. reuteri, Sephadex® (dextran microparticles), and maltose administered once daily for 28 days in 15 autistic participants. SB-121 was safe and well tolerated. SB-121-associated directional improvements in adaptive behavior measured by Vineland-3 and social preference as measured with eye tracking were noted. These results provide support for further clinical evaluation of SB-121 as a treatment in autistic patients. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of SB-121 in subjects with autism spectrum disorder. Single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial. 15 patients with autism spectrum disorder were randomized and analyzed. Daily dosing of SB-121 or placebo for 28 days, followed by approximately a 14 day washout, then 28 days of dosing with other treatment. Incidence and severity of adverse events, presence of Limosilactobacillus reuteri and Sephadex® in stool, and incidence of bacteremia with positive L. reuteri identification. Additional outcomes include changes from baseline on cognitive and behavior tests as well as biomarker levels. Adverse event rates were similar between SB-121 and placebo, with most reported as mild. There were no severe or serious adverse events. No participants had features of suspected bacteremia or notable changes in vital signs, safety laboratory, or ECG parameters from baseline. There was a statistically significant increase from baseline in the Vineland-3 Adaptive Behavior Composite score (p = 0.03) during SB-121 treatment. There was a trend for increased social/geometric viewing ratio following SB-121 treatment compared to placebo. SB-121 was safe and well tolerated.

Until now, there is no proven treatment for the core symptoms of ASD. However, some evidence indicates a crucial link between this disorder and GABAergic signals which are altered in ASD. Bumetanide is a diuretic that reduces chloride, shifts gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) from excitation to inhibition, and may play a significant role in the treatment of ASD. The objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of bumetanide as a treatment for ASD. Eighty children, aged 3-12 years, with ASD diagnosed by Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), ⩾ 30 were included in this double-blind, randomized, and controlled study. Group 1 received Bumetanide, Group 2 received a placebo for 6 months. Follow-up by CARS rating scale was performed before and after 1, 3, and 6 months of treatment. The use of bumetanide in group 1 improved the core symptoms of ASD in a shorter time with minimal and tolerable adverse effects. There was a statistically significant decrease in CARS and most of its fifteen items in group 1 <i>versus</i> group 2 after 6 months of treatment (p-value <0.001). Bumetanide has an important role in the treatment of core symptoms of ASD.","Shaker Esraa, El Agami Osama, Salamah Abeer","CNS & neurological disorders drug targets","Child, Humans, Bumetanide, Diuretics, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Double-Blind Method","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37021422","Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Kafr El-Sheikh University, Kafr El-Sheikh, Egypt.",

Causes of these problems are multifaceted, but culminate in difficulties with interacting in daily life social situations. Current treatments have only moderate effects on social functioning and often target one specific domain. Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to improve the treatment of social interaction difficulties. We developed a modular VR treatment for social functioning and participation (VR-SOAP). In this study, the effect of this intervention will be investigated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). A total of 116 participants (age 18-40) with a DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorder and problems with social functioning will be recruited from mental healthcare institutes in the Netherlands. Participants will be randomized to the experimental condition (VR-SOAP) or active VR control condition (VRelax). VR-SOAP consists of 14 sessions and 5 modules addressing causes of impaired social functioning: four optional modules (1-4) and one fixed module (5). Vrelax consists of 14 sessions that entail psychoeducation, stress management, relaxation techniques, and the exploration of relaxing environments in VR. Primary outcomes are quantity and quality of social contacts, leisure activities and social participation, measured with the experience sampling method (ESM). Secondary outcomes are psychiatric symptoms, social behaviour, social cognition, self-esteem, self-stigma and paranoid thoughts. Treatment effects will be compared at pre-treatment (baseline), post-treatment and at 6-month follow-up. If VR-SOAP proves to be effective, it provides therapists with a much-needed tool to improve social functioning of young adults with a psychotic disorder. Additionally, since the treatment consists of multiple modules targeting different transdiagnostic factors, this trial might provide input for new treatments to improve social functioning in a range of symptoms and disorders, e.g. mood, autism spectrum and anxiety disorders. On the 10th of November 2021, this trial was registered prospectively in the Dutch Trial Register as NL9784 .","Meins Ivo Alexander, Muijsson-Bouwman Dauw Catharina, Nijman Saskia Anne, Greaves-Lord

The efficacy of multiple-dose oxytocin administration in children with ASD is, however, not well established. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with parallel design explored the effects of a 4-week intranasal oxytocin administration (12 IU, twice daily) on parent-rated social responsiveness (Social Responsiveness Scale: SRS-2) in pre-pubertal school-aged children (aged 8-12 years, 61 boys, 16 girls). Secondary outcomes included a questionnaire-based assessment of repetitive behaviors, anxiety, and attachment. Effects of oxytocin were assessed immediately after the administration period and at a follow-up, 4 weeks after the last administration. The double-blind phase was followed by a 4-week single-blind phase during which all participants received intranasal oxytocin. In the double-blind phase, both the oxytocin and placebo group displayed significant pre-to-post-improvements in social responsiveness and secondary questionnaires, but improvements were not specific to the intranasal oxytocin. Notably, in the single-blind phase, participants who were first allocated to intranasal placebo and later changed to intranasal oxytocin displayed a significant improvement in social responsiveness, over and above the placebo-induced improvements noted in the first phase. Participants receiving oxytocin in the first phase also showed a significant further improvement upon receiving a second course of oxytocin, but only at the 4-week follow-up. Further, exploratory moderator analyses indicated that children who received psychosocial trainings (3 or more sessions per month) along with oxytocin administration displayed a more pronounced improvement in social responsiveness. Future studies using larger cohorts and more explicitly controlled concurrent psychosocial trainings are warranted to further explore the preliminary moderator effects, also including understudied populations within the autism spectrum, such as children with co-occurring intellectual disabilities. Four weeks of oxytocin administration did not induce treatment-specific improvements in social responsiveness in school-aged children with ASD. Future studies are warranted to further explore the clinical efficacy of oxytocin administration paired with targeted psychosocial trainings that stimulate socio-communicative behaviors.

There has been a growing emphasis on assessing fidelity of evidence-based practices for autistic children in schools. Fidelity measurement should be multidimensional and focus on core intervention components and assess their link with program outcomes. This study evaluated the relation between intervention fidelity ratings from multiple sources, tested the relation between fidelity ratings and child outcomes, and determined the relations between core intervention components and child outcomes in a study of an evidence-based psychosocial intervention designed to promote inclusion of autistic children at school, Remaking Recess. This study extends from a larger randomized controlled trial examining the effect of implementation support on Remaking Recess fidelity and child outcomes. Schools were randomized to receive the intervention or the intervention plus implementation support. Observers, intervention coaches, and school personnel completed fidelity measures to rate completion and quality of intervention delivery. A measure of peer engagement served as the child outcome. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to determine concordance between raters. Two sets of hierarchical linear models were conducted using fidelity indices as predictors of peer engagement. Coach- and self-rated completion and quality scores, observer- and self-rated quality scores, and observer- and coach-rated quality fidelity scores were significantly correlated. Higher observer-rated completion and quality fidelity scores were predictors of higher peer engagement scores. No single intervention component emerged as a significant predictor of peer engagement. This study demonstrates the importance of using a multidimensional approach for measuring fidelity, testing the link between fidelity and child outcomes, and examining how core intervention components may be associated with child outcomes. Future research should clarify how to improve multi-informant reports to provide ""good enough"" ratings of fidelity that provide meaningful information about outcomes in community settings. Fidelity is defined as how closely an intervention is administered in the way the creators intended. Fidelity is important because it allows researchers to determine what exactly is leading to changes. In recent years, there has been an interest in examining fidelity of interventions for autistic children who receive services in school. This study looked at the relationship between fidelity ratings from multiple individuals, the relationship between fidelity and child outcomes, and the relationship between individual intervention component and child changes in a study of Remaking Recess, an intervention for autistic children at school. Schools were randomly selected to receive the intervention only or the intervention plus implementation support from the research team. Observers, intervention coaches, and individuals delivering the intervention themselves completed fidelity measures. Child engagement with peers was measured before and after the intervention. Several measures of self-, coach-, and observer-report fidelity were associated with each other. Higher observer-reported fidelity was associated with higher child peer engagement scores. No single intervention step was linked to child peer engagement and both treatment groups had similar outcomes in terms of fidelity. This study shows the importance of having multiple raters assess different parts of intervention fidelity, looking at the link between fidelity and child outcomes, and seeing how individual intervention steps may be related to outcomes. Future research should aim to find out which types of fidelity ratings are ""good enough"" to lead to positive changes following treatment so that those aspects can be used and targeted in the future.","Tagavi Daina M, Ahlers Kaitlyn, Bravo Alice, McVey Alana J, Locke Jill","Implementation research and practice",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37091539","Department of Psychology,

Hence, developing effective treatment protocols is urgently needed. Given emerging evidence shows that the abnormal connections of the frontal brain regions contribute to the manifestations of ASD behavioral and cognitive impairments, noninvasive treatment modalities that are capable in modulating brain connections, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), have been postulated to be potentially promising for alleviating core symptoms in ASD. However, whether tDCS can reduce behavioral symptoms and enhance cognitive performance in ASD remains unclear. This randomized controlled trial involving 105 adolescents and young adults with ASD showed that multiple sessions of a tDCS protocol, which was paired up with computerized cognitive training, was effective in improving social functioning in adolescents and young adults with ASD. No prolonged and serious side effects were observed. With more future studies conducted in different clinical settings that recruit participants from a wider age range, this tDCS protocol may be potentially beneficial to a broad spectrum of individuals with autism.","Han Yvonne My, Chan Melody My, Shea Caroline Ks, Mo Flora Ym, Yiu Klaire Wk, Chung Raymond Ck, Cheung Mei-Chun, Chan Agnes S","Autism : the international journal of research and practice",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37151094","The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong.; The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.; Hospital Authority, Hong Kong.",

This study looked at the effects of a brief group-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy program, developed for parents of autistic children, youth, and adults. ACT focuses on increasing psychological flexibility, which is the ability to be mindful and accepting of difficult thoughts and experiences, shown to be important for mental wellness. Participants included 54 parents of autistic people, ages 3-34. Parents were randomly divided into two groups: a Treatment group that received the intervention right away, and a Waitlist group that completed the program after the Treatment group completed the trial. All parents filled out questionnaires right before the program began, and at 3, 7, and 17 weeks after randomization. Compared to the group that was waiting to participate in the program, parents in the Treatment group reported greater improvements in depression and family distress, and these improvements were still present 4 months later. Parents in the Treatment group also reported short-term improvements in their positive feelings and personal goals, compared to those waiting. Results showed that ACT may help improve some aspects of mental health for parents of autistic children, but further research is recommended.","Maughan Andrea L, Lunsky Yona, Lake Johanna, Mills

"37171081","10.7554/Elife.85847","Oxytocin administration enhances pleasantness and neural responses to gentle stroking but not moderate pressure social touch by increasing peripheral concentrations.","2023-05-12","Social touch constitutes a key component of human social relationships, although in some conditions with social dysfunction, such as autism, it can be perceived as unpleasant. We have previously shown that intranasal administration of oxytocin facilitates the pleasantness of social touch and activation of brain reward and social processing regions, although it is unclear if it influences responses to gentle stroking touch mediated by cutaneous C-touch fibers or pressure touch mediated by other types of fibers. Additionally, it is unclear whether endogenous oxytocin acts via direct entry into the brain or by increased peripheral blood concentrations. In a randomized controlled design, we compared effects of intranasal (direct entry into the brain and increased peripheral concentrations) and oral (only peripheral increases) oxytocin on behavioral and neural responses to social touch targeting C-touch (gentle-stroking) or other (medium pressure without stroking) cutaneous receptors. Although both types of touch were perceived as pleasant, intranasal and oral oxytocin equivalently enhanced pleasantness ratings and responses of reward, orbitofrontal cortex, and social processing, superior temporal sulcus, regions only to gentle-stroking not medium pressure touch. Furthermore, increased blood oxytocin concentrations predicted the pleasantness of gentle stroking touch. The specificity of neural effects of oxytocin on C-touch targeted gentle stroking touch were confirmed by time-course extraction and classification analysis. Increased peripheral concentrations of oxytocin primarily modulate its behavioral and neural responses to gentle social touch mediated by C-touch fibers. Findings have potential implications for using oxytocin therapeutically in conditions where social touch is unpleasant. Key Technological Projects of Guangdong Province grant 2018B030335001.

Autistic youth have difficulty accessing mental health care, and this is particularly true for youth from traditionally underserved backgrounds. Providing mental health programs in schools may increase access to care for autistic youth with anxiety. The purpose of the study was to train interdisciplinary school providers to deliver school-based Facing Your Fears, a cognitive behavior therapy program for anxiety in autistic youth. Seventy-seven interdisciplinary school providers across 25 elementary/middle schools were trained by their colleagues and members of the research (train-the-trainer approach). Eighty-one students with autism or suspected autism, ages 8-14 years, were randomly assigned to either school-based Facing Your Fears or usual care. Students in school-based Facing Your Fears showed significant reductions in anxiety compared to students in usual care according to caregiver and student report. Other measures involved examining change in provider cognitive behavior therapy knowledge after training and determining how well interdisciplinary school providers were able to deliver school-based Facing Your Fears. Results indicated that interdisciplinary school providers showed significant improvements in cognitive behavior therapy knowledge after training. Interdisciplinary school providers were able to deliver most of school-based Facing Your Fears activities and with good quality. The positive outcomes in this study are encouraging. Training interdisciplinary school providers to deliver school-based Facing Your Fears may increase access to care for anxious autistic students. Future directions and limitations are discussed.","Reaven Judy, Pickard Katherine, Meyer Allison T, Hayutin Lisa, Middleton Caitlin, Reyes Nuri M, Tanda Tanea, Stahmer Aubyn, Blakeley-Smith Audrey,

"37219040","10.1002/Aur.2954","A lack of efficacy of continuous theta burst stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in autism: A double blind randomized sham-controlled trial.","2023-06-01","Although previous open-label trials suggest the therapeutic potential of inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), methodological caveats exist. We conducted an 8-week randomized, double-blind sham-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of inhibitory continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS, a variant of rTMS) over the left DLPFC in individuals with ASD. Sixty children, adolescents and young adults (aged 8-30 years) with ASD without co-occurring intellectual disabilities were randomized to a 16-session 8-week cTBS versus sham stimulation course, with a follow-up 4 weeks after the trial. The Active group was not superior to the Sham group in any clinical or neuropsychological metrics at Week 8 or Week 12. Time effects of 8-week cTBS on symptoms and executive function were remarkable in both Active and Sham groups, with comparable response rates and effect sizes of changes in symptoms/cognition between groups. Our results from a sufficiently powered sample do not endorse the superior efficacy of cTBS over the left DLPFC to the shamed stimulation for children, adolescents and adults with ASD. These findings suggest that earlier positive open-label trial findings may be generalized by generalized/placebo effects. This highlights the urgent need for more rTMS/TBS studies with rigorous trial designs in ASD.","Ni Hsing-Chang, Chen Yi-Lung, Chao Yi-Ping, Wu Chen-Te, Chen Rao-Shayn, Chou Tai-Li, Gau Susan Shur-Fen,

"37267443","10.1002/14651858.Cd013851.Pub2","Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for autistic spectrum disorders.","2023-06-01","Autism spectrum disorder (autism) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterised by impairments in social communication and interaction, plus restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour and interests. Whilst some people embrace autism as part of their identity, others struggle with their difficulties, and some seek treatment. There are no current interventions that result in complete reduction of autism features. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter for the cholinergic system and has a role in attention, novelty seeking, and memory. Low levels of acetylcholine have been investigated as a potential contributor to autism symptomatology. Donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine (commonly referred to as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) all inhibit acetylcholinesterase, and have slightly different modes of action and biological availability, so their effectiveness and side-effect profiles may vary. The effect of various acetylcholinesterase inhibitor on core autism features across the lifespan, and possible adverse effects, have not been thoroughly investigated. To evaluate the efficacy and harms of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for people with the core features (social interaction, communication, and restrictive and repetitive behaviours) of autism. To assess the effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors on non-core features of autism. In November 2022, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, eight other databases, and two trials registers. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews, and contacted authors of relevant studies. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), comparing acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g. galantamine, donepezil, or rivastigmine) of varying doses, delivered orally or via transdermal patch, either as monotherapy or adjunct therapy, with placebo. People of any age, with a clinical diagnosis of autism were eligible for inclusion. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were core features of autism and adverse effects. Secondary outcomes were language, irritability, hyperactivity, and general health and function. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. We included two RCTs (74 participants). One study was conducted in Iran, the second in the USA, although exact location in the USA is unclear. Galantamine plus risperidone versus placebo plus risperidone One study compared the effects of galantamine plus risperidone to placebo plus risperidone (40 participants, aged 4 years to 12 years). Primary and secondary outcomes of interest were measured postintervention, using subscales of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (score 0 to 3; higher scores = greater impairment). Very low-certainty evidence showed there was little to no difference between the two groups postintervention for social communication (mean difference (MD) -2.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.88 to 0.38), and restricted and repetitive behaviour (MD -0.55, 95% CI -3.47 to 2.37). Overall autism features were not assessed. Adverse events may be higher in the galantamine plus risperidone group (75%) compared with the placebo plus risperidone group (35%): odds ratio 5.57, 95% CI 1.42 to 21.86, low-certainty evidence. No serious adverse events were reported. Low-certainty evidence showed a small difference in irritability (MD -3.50, 95% CI -6.39 to -0.61), with the galantamine plus risperidone group showing a greater decline on the irritability subscale than the placebo group postintervention. There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in hyperactivity postintervention (MD -5.20, 95% CI -10.51 to 0.11). General health and function were not assessed. Donepezil versus placebo One study compared donepezil to placebo (34 participants aged 8 years to 17 years). Primary outcomes of interest were measured postintervention, using subscales of the Modified Version of The Real Life Rating Scale (scored 0 to 3; higher scores = greater impairment). Very low-certainty evidence showed no evidence of group differences immediately postintervention in overall autism features (MD 0.07, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.33), or in the autism symptom domains of social communication (MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.30), and restricted and repetitive behaviours (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.35). Significant adverse events leading to study withdrawal in at least one participant was implied in the data analysis section, but not explicitly reported. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of donepezil, compared to placebo, on the secondary outcomes of interest, including irritability (MD 1.08, 95% CI -0.41 to 2.57), hyperactivity (MD 2.60, 95% CI 0.50 to 4.70), and general health and function (MD 0.03, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.54) postintervention. Across all analyses within this comparison, we judged the evidence to be very low-certainty due to high risk of bias, and very serious imprecision (results based on one small study with wide confidence intervals). The study narratively reported adverse events for the study as a whole, rather than by treatment group. Evidence about the effectiveness of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors as a medication to improve outcomes for autistic adults is lacking, and for autistic children is very uncertain. There is a need for more evidence of improvement in outcomes of relevance to clinical care, autistic people, and their families. There are a number of ongoing studies involving acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and future updates of this review may add to the current evidence.","Ure Alexandra, Cox Georgina R, Haslam Richard,

"37278339","10.1111/Jcpp.13850","Can repeated intranasal oxytocin administration affect reduced neural sensitivity towards expressive faces in autism? A randomized controlled trial.","2023-11-01","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by difficulties in social communication and interaction. Crucial for efficient social interaction is the ability to quickly and accurately extract information from a person's face. Frequency-tagging electroencephalography (EEG) is a novel tool to quantify face-processing sensitivity in a robust and implicit manner. In terms of intervention approaches, intranasal administration of oxytocin (OT) is increasingly considered as a potential pharmacological approach for improving socio-communicative difficulties in ASD, through enhancing social salience and/or reducing (social) stress and anxiety. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, mechanistic pharmaco-neuroimaging clinical trial, we implemented frequency-tagging EEG to conduct an exploratory investigation into the impact of repeated OT administration (4 weeks, 12 IU, twice daily) on neural sensitivity towards happy and fearful facial expressions in children with ASD (8-12 years old; OT: n = 29; placebo: n = 32). Neural effects were assessed at baseline, post-nasal spray (24 hr after the last nasal spray) and at a follow-up session, 4 weeks after the OT administration period. At baseline, neural assessments of children with ASD were compared with those of an age- and gender-matched cohort of neurotypical (NT) children (n = 39). Children with ASD demonstrated reduced neural sensitivity towards expressive faces, as compared to NT children. Upon nasal spray administration, children with ASD displayed a significant increase in neural sensitivity at the post- and follow-up sessions, but only in the placebo group, likely reflecting an implicit learning effect. Strikingly, in the OT group, neural sensitivity remained unaffected from the baseline to the post-session, likely reflecting a dampening of an otherwise typically occurring implicit learning effect. First, we validated the robustness of the frequency-tagging EEG approach to assess reduced neural sensitivity towards expressive faces in children with ASD. Furthermore, in contrast to social salience effects observed after single-dose administrations, repeated OT administration dampened typically occurring learning effects in neural sensitivity. In line with OT's social anxiolytic account, these observations possibly reflect a predominant (social) stress regulatory effect towards emotionally evocative faces after repeated OT administration.","Moerkerke Matthijs, Daniels Nicky, Van der Donck Stephanie, Tibermont Laura, Tang Tiffany, Debbaut Edward, Bamps Annelies, Prinsen Jellina, Steyaert Jean, Alaerts Kaat, Boets Bart","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","Child, Humans, Autistic Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Oxytocin, Administration, Intranasal, Nasal Sprays, Double-Blind Method","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37278339","Center for Developmental Psychiatry, Department of Neurosciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.; Leuven Autism Research (LAuRes), KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.",

Trofinetide is a synthetic analog of glycine-proline-glutamate, the N-terminal tripeptide of the insulin-like growth factor 1 protein, and has demonstrated clinical benefit in phase 2 studies in Rett syndrome. In this phase 3 study ( https://clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT04181723 ), females with Rett syndrome received twice-daily oral trofinetide (n = 93) or placebo (n = 94) for 12 weeks. For the coprimary efficacy endpoints, least squares mean (LSM) change from baseline to week 12 in the Rett Syndrome Behaviour Questionnaire for trofinetide versus placebo was -4.9 versus -1.7 (P = 0.0175; Cohen's d effect size, 0.37), and LSM Clinical Global Impression-Improvement at week 12 was 3.5 versus 3.8 (P = 0.0030; effect size, 0.47). For the key secondary efficacy endpoint, LSM change from baseline to week 12 in the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales Developmental Profile Infant-Toddler Checklist Social Composite score was -0.1 versus -1.1 (P = 0.0064; effect size, 0.43). Common treatment-emergent adverse events included diarrhea (80.6% for trofinetide versus 19.1% for placebo), which was mostly mild to moderate in severity. Significant improvement for trofinetide compared with placebo was observed for the coprimary efficacy endpoints, suggesting that trofinetide provides benefit in treating the core symptoms of Rett syndrome.","Neul Jeffrey L, Percy Alan K, Benke Timothy A, Berry-Kravis Elizabeth M, Glaze Daniel G, Marsh Eric D, Lin Tim, Stankovic Serge, Bishop Kathie M, Youakim James M","Nature medicine","Female, Humans, Rett Syndrome, Treatment Outcome, Glutamates, Double-Blind Method","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37291210","University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.; Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc., San Diego, CA, USA.; Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.; Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc., San Diego, CA, USA. jyouakim@acadia-pharm.com.; Children's Hospital of Colorado and University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.; Vanderbilt Kennedy Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA.",

Disturbances in parents' psychological well-being (anxiety, depression) affect adherence to treatment, making it less effective. There is a need to investigate how to increase psychological wellbeing in parents of children with autism. An 8-week brief training programme using the Mindfulness Parenting (MP) intervention was applied to fourteen parents (6 couples and two mothers). Participants were assigned to one of two groups, both groups received the same treatment but at two different time points. Measures of anxiety (SCAARED), parental stress (PSI-4), autism severity level (AIM) and mindfulness awareness (FFMQ), were assessed. Analysis indicates that MP training increased mindfulness awareness, increasing non-judgment and reactivity, and consequently, reduced anxiety (parental, general, social), improving parent-child interaction. This improvement did not influence parents' perception of the severity of the disorder. The small number of participants precludes generalisation of the results. More clinical trials are needed to demonstrate the usefulness of including these programmes in early intervention services, as well as profiles of parents who may potentially benefit from

In this study, 68 children with confirmed ASD were randomly allocated to receive either l-carnitine (150 mg/day) or matched placebo in addition to risperidone. We utilized the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Edition scale (ABC-C) and a checklist of potential adverse effects to assess changes in behavioral status and safety profile at weeks 0, 5 and 10 of the trial. The primary outcome was defined as a change in the irritability subscale score. Sixty patients with similar baseline characteristics completed the trial period. Although scores of ABC-C subscales significantly decreased in both groups over the trial period, the combination of l-carnitine and risperidone resulted in more reduction on the irritability and hyperactivity subscales compared to the combination of risperidone and placebo ( P  = 0.033 and P  < 0.001, respectively). However, changes in lethargy, stereotypic behavior and inappropriate speech subscales were similar between groups. In conclusion, l-carnitine adjuvant to risperidone could improve irritability and hyperactivity features in children with ASD. Results of this study should be considered preliminary and further clinical trials with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are warranted.","Nasiri Mehry, Parmoon Zohal, Farahmand Yalda, Moradi Ali, Farahmand Kimia, Moradi Kamyar, Basti Fatemeh A, Mohammadi Mohammad-Reza, Akhondzadeh Shahin","International clinical psychopharmacology","Humans, Risperidone, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Male, Double-Blind Method, Female, Carnitine, Child, Antipsychotic Agents, Drug Therapy, Combination, Child, Preschool, Treatment Outcome, Irritable Mood","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37551601","Psychiatric Research Center, Roozbeh Psychiatric Hospital.; School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences.; Islamic Azad University, Tehran Medical Branch, Tehran, Iran.",
"37616029","10.2196/45836","Effects of a Nonwearable Digital Therapeutic Intervention on Preschoolers With Autism Spectrum Disorder in China: Open-Label Randomized Controlled Trial.","2023-08-24","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that can cause difficulty with communication and social interactions as well as complicated family dynamics. Digital health interventions can reduce treatment costs and promote healthy lifestyle changes. These therapies can be adjunctive or replace traditional treatments. However, issues with cooperation and compliance prevent preschool patients with ASD from applying these tools. In this open-label, randomized controlled trial, we developed a nonwearable digital therapy called virtual reality-incorporated cognitive behavioral therapy (VR-CBT). The aim of this study was to assess the adjunctive function of VR-CBT by comparing the effects of VR-CBT plus learning style profile (LSP) intervention with those of LSP-only intervention in preschool children with ASD. This trial was performed in China on 78 preschool children (age 3-6 years, IQ>70) diagnosed with ASD who were randomized to receive a 20-week VR-CBT plus LSP intervention (intervention group, 39/78, 50%) or LSP intervention only (control group, 39/78, 50%). The primary outcome was the change of scores from baseline to week 20, assessed by using the parent-rated Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC). Secondary outcomes included the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS-IV), and behavioral performance data (accuracy and reaction time) in go/no-go tasks. All primary and secondary outcomes were analyzed in the intention-to-treat population. After the intervention, there was an intervention effect on total ABC (β=-5.528; P<.001) and CARS scores (β=-1.365; P=.02). A similar trend was observed in the ABC subscales: sensory (β=-1.133; P=.047), relating (β=-1.512; P=.03), body and object use (β=-1.211; P=.03), and social and self-help (β=-1.593; P=.03). The intervention also showed statistically significant effects in improving behavioral performance (go/no-go task, accuracy, β=2.923; P=.04). Moreover, a significant improvement of ADHD hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms was observed in 53 children with comorbid ADHD based on ADHD-RS-IV (β=-1.269; P=.02). No statistically significant intervention effect was detected in the language subscale of ABC (β=-.080; P=.83). Intervention group girls had larger improvements in ABC subscales, that is, sensory and body and object use and in the CARS score and accuracy of go/no-go task (all P<.05) than the control group girls. Statistically significant intervention effects could be observed in hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms in the intervention group boys with comorbid ADHD compared with those in the control group boys (β=-1.333; P=.03). We found potentially positive effects of nonwearable digital therapy plus LSP on core symptoms associated with ASD, leading to a modest improvement in the function of sensory, motor, and response inhibition, while reducing impulsivity and hyperactivity in preschoolers with both ASD and ADHD. VR-CBT was found to be an effective and feasible adjunctive digital tool.

"37679711","10.1186/S12888-023-05075-2","Cognitive behavior therapy for autistic adolescents, awareness and care for my autistic traits program: a multicenter randomized controlled trial.","2023-09-07","Autistic people demonstrate focused interests, sensitivity to sensory stimulation, and, compared with the general population, differences in social communication and interaction. We examined whether a combination of the Awareness and Care for My Autistic Traits (ACAT) program and treatment-as-usual is more effective than only treatment-as-usual in increasing the understanding of autistic attributes, reducing treatment stigma, and improving mental health and social adaptation among autistic adolescents and their parents/guardians. Forty-nine adolescents and their parents/guardians were randomly assigned to either a combination of ACAT and treatment-as-usual or only treatment-as-usual. The combined group received six weekly 100-minute ACAT sessions, while the treatment-as-usual group received no additional intervention. The primary outcome was the change in understanding of autistic attributes (Autism Knowledge Quiz-Child), administered from pre- to post-intervention. The secondary outcomes included the change in Autism Knowledge Quiz-Parent, reduced treatment stigma, and improved mental health and social adaptation among autistic adolescents and their parents/guardians. A primary outcome measure scale was scored by assessors who were blind to the group assignment. The combined group (both autistic adolescents and their parents/guardians) showed an increase in Autism Knowledge Quiz scores compared to those in the treatment-as-usual group. Autistic adolescents in the combined group also demonstrated a decrease in treatment-related stigma and an improvement in general mental health compared to those in the treatment-as-usual group, while there were no group differences in the change in social adaptation. For parents/guardians, there were no group differences in the change in treatment-related stigma, general mental health, adaptive skills, or attitudes toward their children. The ACAT program could be an effective treatment modality to increase the understanding of autistic attributes among both autistic adolescents and their parents/guardians. The ACAT program positively affects self-understanding, reduces treatment stigma, and stabilizes behavioral issues for autistic adolescents as a part of mental health measures, but it does not effectively reduce treatment barriers or improve mental health for parents/guardians. Further research should consider whether additional support for parents/guardians could be beneficial. The study was registered in UMIN (UMIN000029851, 06/01/2018).","Oshima Fumiyo, Mandy William, Seto Mikuko, Hongo Minako, Tsuchiyagaito Aki, Hirano Yoshiyuki, Sutoh Chihiro, Guan Siqing, Nitta Yusuke,

"37701816","10.1093/Braincomms/Fcad226","Effects of transcranial pulse stimulation on autism spectrum disorder: a double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial.","2023-01-01","Transcranial pulse stimulation has been proven effective to improve cognition, memory and depressive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, but supporting evidence on other neurological diseases or neuropsychiatric disorders remains limited. This study aimed to investigate the effects of transcranial pulse stimulation on the right temporoparietal junction, which is a key node for social cognition for autism spectrum disorder, and to examine the association between transcranial pulse stimulation and executive and social functions. This double-blinded, randomized, sham-controlled trial included 32 participants (27 males), aged 12-17 years with autism spectrum disorder. All eligible participants were randomized into either the verum or sham transcranial pulse stimulation group, on a 1:1 ratio, based on the Childhood Autism Rating Scale screening score. Sixteen participants received six verum transcranial pulse stimulation sessions (energy level: 0.2-0.25 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>; pulse frequency: 2.5-4.0 Hz, 800 pulse/session) in 2 weeks on alternate days. The remaining 16 participants received sham transcranial pulse stimulation. The primary outcome measure included Childhood Autism Rating Scale score changes, evaluated by parents, from baseline to 3-month follow-ups. Secondary outcomes included a self-reported questionnaire responded to by parents and cognitive tests responded to by participants. A licensed mental health professional evaluated clinical global impression severity, improvement, efficacy and total score. Results revealed significant interactions in Childhood Autism Rating Scale and other secondary outcomes. Significant group and time effects were found in most secondary outcomes. Additionally, significant differences were found between the transcranial pulse stimulation and sham transcranial pulse stimulation groups in Childhood Autism Rating Scale and clinical global impression improvement and total score immediately after 2 weeks of transcranial pulse stimulation intervention (all <i>P</i> < 0.05), and effects were sustainable at 1- and 3-month follow-up, compared with baseline. The effect size of Childhood Autism Rating Scale (<i>d</i> = 0.83-0.95) and clinical global impression improvement (<i>d</i> = 4.12-4.37) were large to medium immediately after intervention and sustained at 1-month post-stimulation; however, the effects were reduced to small at 3-month post-stimulation (<i>d</i> = 2.31). These findings indicated that transcranial pulse stimulation over right temporoparietal junction was effective to reduce the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, as evidenced by a 24% reduction in the total Childhood Autism Rating Scale score in the verum transcranial pulse stimulation group. Additionally, the clinical global impression total score was reduced by 53.7% in the verum transcranial pulse stimulation group at a 3-month follow-up, compared with the baseline. Participants in the verum transcranial pulse stimulation group had shown substantial improvement at 1- and 3-month follow-ups, compared with baseline, although some of the neuropsychological test results were deemed statistically insignificant. Future replication of this study should include a larger sample derived from multi-nations to determine transcranial pulse stimulation as an alternative top-on treatment option in neuropsychiatry.","Cheung Teris, Li Tim Man Ho, Lam Joyce Yuen Ting, Fong Kwan Hin, Chiu Lok Yi, Ho Yuen Shan, Tse Andy Choi-Yeung, Li Cheng-Ta, Cheng Calvin Pak-Wing, Beisteiner Roland","Brain communications",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37701816","Department of Psychiatry, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; School of Nursing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei 112, Taiwan.; Department of Psychiatry, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Department of Neurology, Medical University of Vienna, Wien 1090, Austria.; Department of Health and Physical Education, The Education University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.",
"37703248","10.1371/Journal.Pone.0291168","The mechanism and effectiveness of mindfulness-based intervention for reducing the psychological distress of parents of children with autism spectrum disorder: A protocol of randomized control trial of ecological momentary intervention and assessment.","2023-01-01","Existing studies have unequivocally demonstrated that parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience various stressful daily life events and suffer from psychological distress. Mindfulness level is found to be an effective buffer between parents' appraisal of stress life events and psychological distress. However, the mechanism behind the function of mindfulness is unclear, and traditional mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) in experimental settings is not tailored to personal real-life needs. This study proposes to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the effectiveness of MBI delivered by ecological momentary intervention (EMI) and assessed by ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in changing participants' cognitive appraisal of stressful life events and thus reducing the psychological distress of parents of children with ASD. The proposed study will recruit 670 parents of children with ASD and randomly assign them to the intervention and control groups (335 in each group). Participants in the intervention group will install the EMI/A app on their smartphones. In the app, participants can receive practice prompts daily, browse and practice different mindfulness exercises in the intervention library at any time, talk to a virtual counselor (chatbot) when feeling stressed, complete EMA on the cognitive appraisal of life events, and receive the log of change of psychological status daily. Participants in the control group will only receive audio-based standardized mindfulness practice instructions three times per week. The effects of MBI will be assessed based on the EMA data, right after the intervention and at the 2-month follow-up. The primary outcome will be participants' psychological distress measured by the depression anxiety stress scale. The secondary outcomes will include participants' subjective well-being, measured by the satisfaction with life scale, and level of resilience, measured by the psychological empowerment scale. Multilevel structural equational modelling will be applied to examine the pathways of the relationship between daily life events, cognitive appraisal, and psychological distress. The potential benefit of the proposed study is to increase the psychological well-being of parents of children with ASD, and the method may extend to participants suffering from other psychological issues in the future.

The effects of acupuncture and behavioural therapy, two nonpharmalogical interventions, on social function in ASD patients are still controversial. This meta-analysis investigated the impact of these two treatments and compared their effects. Seven electronic databases were systematically searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the use of acupuncture or behavioural therapy for ASD. A meta-analysis was carried out using Review Manager 5.4 software. Continuous data are reported as mean differences (MDs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). An assessment of methodological quality using the Cochrane risk-of-bias (ROB) tool for trials was carried out. The Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was applied to evaluate the quality (certainty) of evidence for results regarding social function indicators. Thirty RCTs on acupuncture and 36 on behavioural therapy were included. Compared with the control condition, body acupuncture (SMD: 0.76, 95% CI: [0.52, 1.01]; low certainty), modern acupuncture technology (SMD: 0.84, 95% CI: [0.32, 1.35]; low certainty), cognitive behavioural therapy (SMD: 0.42, 95% CI: [0.26, 0.58]; high certainty), the Denver model (SMD: 0.61, 95% CI: [0.23, 0.99]; moderate certainty) and social skills training (SMD: 0.56, 95% CI: [0.41, 0.71]; moderate certainty) improved social functioning. Behavioural therapies (such as CBT, the Denver model, social skills training), improved the social functioning of patients with ASD in the short and long term, as supported by high- and moderate-quality evidence. Acupuncture (including scalp acupuncture, body acupuncture and use of modern acupuncture technology) also improved social functioning, as supported by low- and very low-quality evidence. More high-quality evidence is needed to confirm the effect of acupoint catgut embedding and Early Intensive Behavioural Intervention (EIBI).","Yu Zhili, Zhang Peiming, Tao Chenyang, Lu Liming, Tang

In both studies, patients were randomized to receive bumetanide oral solution twice daily (BID) or placebo BID during a 6-month double-blind treatment period. The primary endpoint was change in Childhood Autism Rating Scale 2 (CARS2) total raw score from baseline to Week 26. Key secondary endpoints included changes in Social Responsiveness Scale-2, Clinical Global Impression Scale, and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale. Each study enrolled 211 patients (bumetanide, n = 107; placebo, n = 104). Both studies were terminated early due to absence of any significant difference between bumetanide and placebo in the overall studied populations. In both studies, CARS2 total raw score decreased from baseline to Week 26 in the bumetanide and placebo groups, with no statistically significant difference between groups. No differences were observed between treatment groups for any of the secondary efficacy endpoints in either study. In both studies, treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred more frequently with bumetanide than placebo included thirst, polyuria, hypokalemia, and dry mouth. These large phase III trials failed to demonstrate a benefit of bumetanide for the treatment of pediatric ASD compared with placebo. Consequently, the sponsor has discontinued the development of bumetanide for the treatment of this condition.

The study utilized the PubMed and Embase databases to locate randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental treatment studies, and randomized clinical trial comparisons. The experimental group received treatment based on an applied behavioral approach, such as PECS, DTT, PRT, TEACCH, ESDM, and EIBI. After examining seventeen studies, the researchers found that each type of behavioral intervention had a positive impact. Naturalistic protocols that employed PRT and PECS improved ASD symptoms in general, despite their targeting of particular cognitive domains such as language. ESDM enhanced receptive language, particularly in preschool-aged children. Structured and integrated interventions, like EIBI and TEACCH, improved overall adaptive functioning. Combining DTT with a TEACCH program produced greater benefits in linguistic, affective-social, and personal autonomy domains. However, there is a scarcity of high-quality research available on behavioral interventions for ASD. Further comparative studies are necessary to identify cost-efficient interventions. For example, PRT and PECS significantly improved social communication skills in only 15-40 hours over six months. The authors emphasized the need for continued research and the application of evidence-based interventions in specialized settings.","Pruneti Carlo, Coscioni Gabriella, Guidotti Sara","Clinical child

Previous investigations have emphasized the amygdala as the neural foundation for oxytocin's acute effects. However, to fully understand oxytocin's therapeutic potential, it is crucial to gain insight into the neuroplastic changes in amygdala circuitry induced from chronic oxytocin administrations, particularly in pediatric populations. We aimed to examine the impact of a 4-week course of intranasal oxytocin on amygdala functional connectivity in children with autism, compared to placebo. Additionally, we investigated whether oxytocin improves cardiac autonomic arousal, as indexed by high-frequency heart rate variability. Fifty-seven children with autism aged 8-12 years (45 boys, 12 girls) participated in a double-blind, randomized pharmaco-neuroimaging trial involving twice-daily administrations of intranasal oxytocin or placebo. Resting-state fMRI scans and simultaneous, in-scanner heart rate recordings were obtained before, immediately after, and 4 weeks after the nasal spray administration period. Significant reductions in intrinsic amygdala-orbitofrontal connectivity were observed, particularly at the 4-week follow-up session. These reductions were correlated with improved social symptoms and lower cardiac autonomic arousal. Further, oxytocin's neural and cardiac autonomic effects were modulated by epigenetic modifications of the oxytocin receptor gene. The effects were more pronounced in children with reduced epigenetic methylation, signifying heightened expression of the oxytocin receptor. These findings underscore that a 4-week oxytocin administration course decreases amygdala connectivity and improves cardiac autonomic balance. Epigenetic modulators may explain inter-individual variation in responses to oxytocin.","Alaerts Kaat, Daniels Nicky, Moerkerke Matthijs, Evenepoel Margaux, Tang Tiffany, Van der Donck Stephanie, Chubar Viktoria, Claes Stephan, Steyaert Jean, Boets Bart, Prinsen Jellina","Psychotherapy and psychosomatics","Male, Female, Child, Humans, Oxytocin, Autistic Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Receptors, Oxytocin, Amygdala, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Double-Blind Method","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37820592","KU Leuven, University Psychiatric Center, Leuven, Belgium.; KU Leuven, Leuven Autism Research (LAuRes) Consortium, Leuven, Belgium.; KU Leuven, Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Research Group for Neurorehabilitation, Leuven, Belgium.",

Preclinical models implicate ϒ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in this process. However, the link between GABA and auditory processing in humans (with or without ASD) is largely correlational. As part of a study of potential biosignatures of GABA function in ASD to inform future clinical trials, we evaluated the role of GABA in auditory repetition suppression in 66 adults (n = 28 with ASD). Neurophysiological responses (temporal and frequency domains) to repetitive standard tones and novel deviants presented in an oddball paradigm were compared after double-blind, randomized administration of placebo, 15 or 30 mg of arbaclofen (STX209), a GABA type B (GABA<sub>B</sub>) receptor agonist. We first established that temporal mismatch negativity was comparable between participants with ASD and those with typical development (TD). Next, we showed that temporal and spectral responses to repetitive standards were suppressed relative to responses to deviants in the two groups, but suppression was significantly weaker in individuals with ASD at baseline. Arbaclofen reversed weaker suppression of spectral responses in ASD but disrupted suppression in TD. A post hoc analysis showed that arbaclofen-elicited shift in suppression was correlated with autistic symptomatology measured using the Autism Quotient across the entire group, though not in the smaller sample of the ASD and TD group when examined separately. Thus, our results confirm: GABAergic dysfunction contributes to the neurophysiology of auditory sensory processing alterations in ASD, and can be modulated by targeting GABA<sub>B</sub> activity. These GABA-dependent sensory differences may be upstream of more complex autistic phenotypes.","Huang Qiyun, Velthuis Hester, Pereira Andreia C, Ahmad Jumana, Cooke Samuel F, Ellis Claire L, Ponteduro Francesca M, Puts Nicolaas A J, Dimitrov Mihail, Batalle Dafnis, Wong Nichol M L, Kowalewski Lukasz, Ivin Glynis, Daly Eileen, Murphy Declan G M, McAlonan Gráinne M","Translational psychiatry","Adult, Humans, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Auditory Perception, GABA-B Receptor Agonists, Autistic Disorder, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37852957","School of Human Sciences, University of Greenwich, London, UK.; Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK. qiyun.huang@kcl.ac.uk.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust Pharmacy, London, UK.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK. grainne.mcalonan@kcl.ac.uk.",
"37873560","10.1002/Aur.3041","The use of noninvasive brain stimulation techniques in autism spectrum disorder.","2024-01-01","Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), have recently emerged as alternative, nonpharmacological interventions for a variety of psychiatric, neurological, and neurodevelopmental conditions. NIBS is beginning to be applied in both research and clinical settings for the treatment of core and associated symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) including social communication deficits, restricted and repetitive behaviors, irritability, hyperactivity, depression and impairments in executive functioning and sensorimotor integration. Though there is much promise for these targeted device-based interventions, in other disorders (including adult major depressive disorder (MDD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) where rTMS is FDA cleared), data on the safety and efficacy of these interventions in individuals with ASD is limited especially in younger children when neurodevelopmental interventions typically begin. Most studies are open-label, small scale, and/or focused on a restricted subgroup of individuals with ASD. There is a need for larger, randomized controlled trials that incorporate neuroimaging in order to develop predictive biomarkers of treatment response and optimize treatment parameters. We contend that until such studies are conducted, we do not have adequate estimates of the safety and efficacy of NIBS interventions in children across the spectrum. Thus, broad off-label use of these techniques in this population is not supported by currently available evidence. Here we discuss the existing data on the use of NIBS to treat symptoms related to ASD and discuss future directions for the field.","Oberman Lindsay M, Francis Sunday M, Lisanby Sarah H","Autism

"37886114","10.3389/Fpsyt.2023.1256771","Music for autism: a protocol for an international randomized crossover trial on music therapy for children with autism.","2023-01-01","The notion of a connection between autism and music is as old as the first reported cases of autism, and music has been used as a therapeutic tool for many decades. Music therapy holds promise as an intervention for individuals with autism, harnessing their strengths in music processing to enhance communication and expression. While previous randomized controlled trials have demonstrated positive outcomes in terms of global improvement and quality of life, their reliance on psychological outcomes restricts our understanding of underlying mechanisms. This paper introduces the protocol for the Music for Autism study, a randomized crossover trial designed to investigate the effects of a 12-week music therapy intervention on a range of psychometric, neuroimaging, and biological outcomes in school-aged children with autism. The protocol builds upon previous research and aims to both replicate and expand upon findings that demonstrated improvements in social communication and functional brain connectivity following a music intervention. The primary objective of this trial is to determine whether music therapy leads to improvements in social communication and functional brain connectivity as compared to play-based therapy. In addition, secondary aims include exploring various relevant psychometric, neuroimaging, and biological outcomes. To achieve these objectives, we will enroll 80 participants aged 6-12 years in this international, assessor-blinded, crossover randomized controlled trial. Each participant will be randomly assigned to receive either music therapy or play-based therapy for a period of 12 weeks, followed by a 12-week washout period, after which they will receive the alternate intervention. Assessments will be conducted four times, before and after each intervention period. The protocol of the Music for Autism trial provides a comprehensive framework for studying the effects of music therapy on a range of multidimensional outcomes in children with autism. The findings from this trial have the potential to contribute to the development of evidence-based interventions that leverage strengths in music processing to address the complex challenges faced by individuals with autism. <b>Clinical Trial Registration</b>: Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT04936048.","Ruiz Marianna, Groessing Alexander, Guran Alexandrina, Koçan Asena U, Mikus Nace, Nater Urs M,

The development of treatments that target common neural circuit dysfunctions caused by known genetic defects, namely, disruption of the excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance, is promising. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is capable of modulating the E/I balance in healthy individuals, yet its clinical and neurobiological effects in ASD remain elusive. This double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial investigated the effects of multisession cathodal prefrontal tDCS coupled with online cognitive remediation on social functioning, information processing efficiency and the E/I balance in ASD patients aged 14-21 years. Sixty individuals were randomly assigned to receive either active or sham tDCS (10 sessions in total, 20 min/session, stimulation intensity: 1.5 mA, cathode: F3, anode: Fp2, size of electrodes: 25 cm<sup>2</sup>) combined with 20 min of online cognitive remediation. Social functioning, information processing efficiency during cognitive tasks, and theta- and gamma-band E/I balance were measured one day before and after the treatment. Compared to sham tDCS, active cathodal tDCS was effective in enhancing overall social functioning [F(1, 58) = 6.79, p = .012, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.105, 90% CI: (0.013, 0.234)] and information processing efficiency during cognitive tasks [F(1, 58) = 10.07, p = .002, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.148, 90% CI: (0.034, 0.284)] in these individuals. Electroencephalography data showed that this cathodal tDCS protocol was effective in reducing the theta-band E/I ratio of the cortical midline structures [F(1, 58) = 4.65, p = .035, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.074, 90% CI: (0.010, 0.150)] and that this reduction significantly predicted information processing efficiency enhancement (b = -2.546, 95% BCa CI: [-4.979, -0.113], p = .041). Our results support the use of multisession cathodal tDCS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex combined with online cognitive remediation for reducing the elevated theta-band E/I ratio in sociocognitive information processing circuits in ASD patients, resulting in more adaptive regulation of global brain dynamics that is associated with enhanced information processing efficiency after the intervention.","Chan Melody M Y, Choi Coco X T, Tsoi Tom C W, Shea Caroline K S, Yiu Klaire W K, Han Yvonne M Y","Brain stimulation","Humans, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation, Autistic Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Cognitive Training, Brain, Electroencephalography, Double-Blind Method, Electrodes, Prefrontal Cortex","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37918630","Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital, Hospital Authority, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region; Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.; Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.; Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region; University Research Facility in Behavioral and Systems Neuroscience (UBSN), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of Infra-Low Frequency (ILF) neurofeedback in improving inhibitory control among high-functioning adolescents with ASD. A single-blind, two-armed randomized controlled trial was conducted with 24 adolescents with ASD randomly divided into two groups (active and sham; <i>n</i> = 12 per group). Both groups participated in 15 sessions of one-hour ILF neurofeedback, three times per week. The ILF neurofeedback protocol was applied to the active group, while the sham group received an inactive intervention. Outcomes were measured at the pretest, post-test, and follow-up stages. ILF neurofeedback significantly improved inhibitory control in adolescents with ASD, as indicated by improvements in behavioral measures and absolute power analysis. The most significant differences were observed in alpha, theta, and gamma waves located in the central areas of the left gyrus. However, no significant effect was observed at the follow-up level on either behavioral measures or absolute power. The results suggest that ILF neurofeedback is effective in improving inhibitory control in high-functioning adolescents with ASD. This non-invasive intervention has the potential to improve inhibitory control in this population. However, future research is needed to determine the long-term effects of ILF neurofeedback.","Esmaeilzadeh Kanafgourabi Seyedeh Neda, Shabani Mohsen, Mirchi Zahra, Aliyari Hamed, Mahdavi Parisa","Applied neuropsychology.

"37943121","10.1002/Aur.3048","The devil is in the details: Advancing our collective understanding of naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions.","2024-01-01","Given the growing body of randomized trials examining various Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Intervention (NDBI) approaches, a dialog has emerged exploring the overlap in strategies across NDBIs to create single measures that propose to capture core strategies across the interventions. This commentary will ask readers to consider the current state of the science, the potential value of looking not only for similarities but also for differences across approaches, and present five scientific next steps to advance our collective understanding of the NDBIs including: (a) operationalizing intervention strategies and outcomes, (b) expansion of the effectiveness evidence base and begin testing implementation strategies for individual NDBIs, (c) rigorous testing of core intervention components and the mechanism of each intervention, (d) personalization, and (e) supporting

However, it remains unclear whether physical exercise or melatonin supplement, or a combination of both, is more effective in improving sleep quality in this population. The purpose of this study is to answer this research question by comparing the effectiveness of three types of interventions (physical exercise vs. melatonin supplement or a combination of both) in improving sleep quality in children with ASD. Sixty-two (62) children diagnosed with ASD were randomly assigned to one of four groups: cycling (n = 18), melatonin supplement (n = 14), a combination of both (n = 12), and placebo control group (n = 18). Four (4) sleep parameters (sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, sleep duration, and wake after sleep onset) were assessed. The results revealed a significant improvement in sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, and sleep duration in all of the interventions, but not in the placebo control group. However, no significant group differences were found among the interventions (ps > .05). Our findings suggest similar effectiveness of physical exercise and melatonin supplementation in improving sleep quality in children with ASD.","Tse Andy C Y, Lee Paul H, Sit Cindy H P, Poon Eric Tsz-Chun, Sun F, Pang Chi-Ling, Cheng James C H","Journal of autism and developmental disorders","Humans, Melatonin, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Male, Female, Child, Exercise, Sleep Quality, Dietary Supplements, Exercise Therapy, Treatment Outcome, Child, Preschool, Sleep, Sleep Wake Disorders, Combined Modality Therapy","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37950776","Department of Health and Physical Education, The Education University of Hong Kong, Rm D4-2/F-02, Block D4, 10 Lo Ping Road, Tai Po, N.T, Hong Kong, China. andytcy@eduhk.hk.; School of Education, John Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA.; Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Health, United Christian Hospital, Hong Kong, China.; Department of Sports Science and Physical Education, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Department of Health and Physical Education, The Education University of Hong Kong, Rm D4-2/F-02, Block D4, 10 Lo Ping Road, Tai Po, N.T, Hong Kong, China.; Clinical Trial Unit, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.",

Updated systematic review and meta-analysis (autism intervention meta-analysis; Project AIM). A search was conducted in November 2021 (updating a search done in November 2017) of the following databases and registers: Academic Search Complete, CINAHL Plus with full text, Education Source, Educational Administration Abstracts, ERIC, Medline, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, PsycINFO, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, and SocINDEX with full text, <i>Trials</i>, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Any controlled group study testing the effects of any non-pharmacological intervention on any outcome in young autistic children younger than 8 years. Newly identified studies were integrated into the previous dataset and were coded for participant, intervention, and outcome characteristics. Interventions were categorized by type of approach (such as behavioral, developmental, naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention, and technology based), and outcomes were categorized by domain (such as social communication, adaptive behavior, play, and language). Risks of bias were evaluated following guidance from Cochrane. Effects were estimated for all intervention and outcome types with sufficient contributing data, stratified by risk of bias, using robust variance estimation to account for intercorrelation of effects within studies and subgroups. The search yielded 289 reports of 252 studies, representing 13 304 participants and effects for 3291 outcomes. When contributing effects were restricted to those from randomized controlled trials, significant summary effects were estimated for behavioral interventions on social emotional or challenging behavior outcomes (Hedges' g=0.58, 95% confidence interval 0.11 to 1.06; P=0.02), developmental interventions on social communication (0.28, 0.12 to 0.44; P=0.003); naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions on adaptive behavior (0.23, 0.02 to 0.43; P=0.03), language (0.16, 0.01 to 0.31; P=0.04), play (0.19, 0.02 to 0.36; P=0.03), social communication (0.35, 0.23 to 0.47; P<0.001), and measures of diagnostic characteristics of autism (0.38, 0.17 to 0.59; P=0.002); and technology based interventions on social communication (0.33, 0.02 to 0.64; P=0.04) and social emotional or challenging behavior outcomes (0.57, 0.04 to 1.09; P=0.04). When effects were further restricted to exclude caregiver or teacher report outcomes, significant effects were estimated only for developmental interventions on social communication (0.31, 0.13 to 0.49; P=0.003) and naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions on social communication (0.36, 0.23 to 0.49; P<0.001) and measures of diagnostic characteristics of autism (0.44, 0.20 to 0.68; P=0.002). When effects were then restricted to exclude those at high risk of detection bias, only one significant summary effect was estimated-naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions on measures of diagnostic characteristics of autism (0.30, 0.03 to 0.57; P=0.03). Adverse events were poorly monitored, but possibly common. The available evidence on interventions to support young autistic children has approximately doubled in four years. Some evidence from randomized controlled trials shows that behavioral interventions improve caregiver perception of challenging behavior and child social emotional functioning, and that technology based interventions support proximal improvements in specific social communication and social emotional skills. Evidence also shows that developmental interventions improve social communication in interactions with caregivers, and naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions improve core challenges associated with autism, particularly difficulties with social communication. However, potential benefits of these interventions cannot be weighed against the potential for adverse effects owing to inadequate monitoring and reporting.","Sandbank Micheal, Bottema-Beutel Kristen,

In the current clinical trial, we sought to isolate the most effective strategies to improve short-term and long-term child communication outcomes. Results demonstrated how children may benefit from caregiver prompts to facilitate long-term language outcomes. In conclusion, the current study improves our understanding of how early intervention facilitates child communication outcomes.","Jones Maranda K, Sone Bailey J, Grauzer Jeffrey, Sudec Laura, Kaat

"38009186","10.1177/13623613231213543","Community-guided, autism-adapted group cognitive behavioral therapy for depression in autistic youth (CBT-DAY): Preliminary feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy.","2024-08-01","Depression in youth is a significant public health problem worldwide, particularly for autistic youth who are over twice as likely to experience depression than their non-autistic peers. Although pathways to depression are complex, emotional reactivity and negative self-esteem are two risk factors for depression in autistic and non-autistic youth. Although autistic youth are more likely to experience depression than their non-autistic peers, psychotherapy options for autistic youth are very limited; community guidance in the development and testing of psychotherapy programs is a promising approach in autism. Therefore, in this study, we designed an autism-adapted CBT-DAY, in collaboration with autistic community members. Specifically, CBT-DAY combined neurodiversity-affirming and cognitive behavioral approaches to target emotional reactivity and self-esteem in youth to improve depressive symptom severity in a group setting across 12 weeks. We examined the preliminary feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of CBT-DAY in a pilot non-randomized trial. In addition, we implemented a rigorous protocol for assessing, monitoring, and addressing potential harms in this intervention. Results from 24 autistic youth (11-17 years old) suggest that CBT-DAY may be feasible to use in an outpatient clinical setting and generally acceptable to youth and their caregivers. Participation in CBT-DAY may be associated with significant improvements in youth emotional reactivity and self-esteem, as well as depressive symptom severity per self-report only. Exploratory analyses showed that participation in CBT-DAY may also be associated with significant improvements in internalizing symptoms. Findings demonstrate the potential promise of neurodiversity-affirming and cognitive behavioral approaches to treating depressive symptoms in some autistic youth.","Schwartzman Jessica M, Roth Marissa

"38060224","10.1001/Jamanetworkopen.2023.46715","Nature-Based Interventions for Autistic Children: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","2023-12-01","There is a gap in the evidence regarding nature-based interventions (NBIs) for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To systematically review and meta-analyze available evidence on the health-related outcomes in NBIs for children with ASD. The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane, Embase, Emcare, Education Resources Information Center, Global Health, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science were searched from inception until May 2023. Google Scholar and references from included studies were searched for additional studies. Included studies were randomized clinical trials (RCTs), controlled studies, and single-group before-and-after studies that reported health-related outcomes. This review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) reporting guidelines. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to synthesize the data. The findings of studies that were ineligible for meta-analysis were summarized according to the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWIM) reporting guidelines. The outcomes of interest were health-related outcomes (ie, social functioning, behavioral functioning, emotional functioning, sensory functioning) and the self-reported well-being of children with ASD. A total of 24 studies with 717 participants (mean age range, 5.3 to 17.8 years; 141 [21.9%] female) were included. A meta-analysis from 13 studies indicated a significant negative moderate association between NBIs and social communication (standardized mean difference [SMD], -0.59; 95% CI, -0.85 to -0.34). For behavioral functioning outcomes, NBIs showed a significant moderate association with reduced hyperactivity (SMD, -0.56; 95% CI, -0.86 to -0.26) and a small to moderate association with reduced irritability (SMD, -0.49; 95% CI, -0.79 to -0.19). For sensory functioning, NBIs were significantly associated with improved inattention and distractibility (SMD, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.60). Significant moderate associations were observed in sensory seeking (SMD, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.33 to 1.22; P < .001; I2 = 0%) and sensory sensitivity (SMD, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.12 to 1.00; P = .01; I2 = 0%). Heterogeneity of the intervention effects was not high, and I2 ranged from 0% to 67%. The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggested an association of NBIs in group-based recreational therapy with experiential learning with positive short-term outcomes on sensory, social, and behavioral functioning for children with ASD. Future evidence using robust study design to aid the health and functional trajectories of children with ASD is recommended.","Fan Myrian Sze Nga, Li William Ho Cheung, Ho Laurie Long Kwan, Phiri

The objective of this study was to estimate the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation in pregnancy on risk of autism and ADHD. This randomized clinical trial was part of the COpenhagen Prospective Study on Neuro-PSYCHiatric Development (COPYCH) project nested within the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC2010) cohort comprising a population-based sample of 700 healthy mother-child pairs enrolled at week 24 of pregnancy. Maternal 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D) was measured at inclusion and 623 mothers were randomized 1:1 to either high-dose (2800 IU/d) or standard dose (400 IU/d) vitamin D3 until 1 wk postpartum (315 received high-dose, 308 standard dose). At age 10, diagnoses and symptom load of autism and ADHD, respectively, were established using the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version. The psychopathologic evaluation was completed by 591 children aged 10 y, and 16 children (2.7%) were diagnosed with autism and 65 (11.0%) with ADHD. Hereof, 496 children participated in the vitamin D3 trial (246 received high-dose, 250 standard dose). Of these, 12 children (2.4%) were diagnosed with autism and 58 (11.7%) with ADHD. Higher maternal preintervention 25(OH)D levels were associated with a decreased risk of autism [odd ratio (OR) per 10 nmol/L: 0.76 (0.59,0.97); P = 0.034], lower autistic symptom load [β per 10 nmol/L: -0.03 (-0.05,0.00); P = 0.024), and decreased risk of ADHD diagnosis (OR per 10 nmol/L: 0.88 (0.78,0.99); P = 0.033]. High-dose vitamin D3 supplementation was not associated with risk of autism or ADHD. Higher maternal preintervention 25(OH)D was associated with a decreased risk of autism, lower autistic symptom load, and decreased risk of ADHD diagnosis, but high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation in pregnancy had no effect on risk of autism and ADHD.

Propranolol is widely utilized to treat performance and public speaking anxiety. Single-dose psychopharmacological challenge studies suggested benefits using propranolol for verbal tasks and social interaction. We conducted a double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of the β-adrenergic antagonist propranolol in ASD for social interaction, anxiety, and language. Seventy-four participants with ASD, age 7-24 years, were enrolled and randomized to a 12-week course of propranolol or placebo, with blinded assessments at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the General Social Outcome Measure-2 (GSOM-2) for social interaction, and secondary outcomes were the Clinician Global Clinical Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) ratings independently conducted for social interaction, anxiety, and language at 6 weeks and 12 weeks. Sixty-nine participants completed the 12-week visit. No significant effect of drug was found for the GSOM-2 or the CGI-I for social interaction or language. CGI-I for anxiety showed greater improvement with propranolol at the 12-week time point (p = 0.045, odds ratio = 2.58 (95% CI = 1.02-6.52). Expected decreases in heart rate and blood pressure were observed with propranolol, and side effects were uncommon. Propranolol did not impact social interaction measures or language, but there were indications of a beneficial effect for anxiety. This will need confirmation in a larger multicenter trial, monitoring markers or characteristics to identify those participants most likely to respond to propranolol for anxiety, and determine whether there is a subset of participants that are responsive for other previously reported outcomes.","Beversdorf David Q, Ferguson Bradley, Hunter Samantha, Hirst Kathy, Lolli Bridget, Bellesheim Katherine R, Barton Amy U, Muckerman Julie, Takahashi Nicole, Selders Kimberly, Holem Ryan, Sohl Kristin, Dyke Peter, Stichter Janine, Mazurek Micah, Kanne Stephen","Psychopharmacology","Child, Humans, Young Adult, Adolescent, Adult, Propranolol, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Adrenergic beta-Antagonists, Anxiety, Communication, Treatment Outcome","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38086927","University of Virginia, Charlottesville, USA.; Thompson Center for Autism & Neurodevelopmental Disorders, University of Missouri, One Hospital Drive, Columbia, MO, DC069.1065212, USA. beversdorfd@health.missouri.edu.; Weill-Cornell Medical College, NY, USA.; University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA.; Department of Special Education, University of Missouri, Columbia, USA.; Northwest Missouri State University, Maryville, USA.; Thompson Center for Autism & Neurodevelopmental Disorders, University of Missouri, One Hospital Drive, Columbia, MO, DC069.1065212, USA.; Deparment of Child Health, University of Missouri, Columbia, USA.",

Because effective treatments for ASD remain elusive, novel therapeutic strategies are necessary. Preclinical studies show that L. reuteri selectively reversed social deficits in several models for ASD. Here, in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we tested the effect of L. reuteri (a product containing a combination of strains ATCC-PTA-6475 and DSM-17938) in children with ASD. The treatment does not alter overall autism severity, restricted/repetitive behaviors, the microbiome composition, or the immune profile. However, L. reuteri combination yields significant improvements in social functioning that generalized across different measures. Interestingly, ATCC-PTA-6475, but not the parental strain of DSM-17938, reverses the social deficits in a preclinical mouse model for ASD. Collectively, our findings show that L. reuteri enhances social behavior in children with ASD, thereby warranting larger trials in which strain-specific effects should also be investigated.","Mazzone Luigi, Dooling Sean W, Volpe Elisabetta, Uljarević Mirko, Waters Jillian L, Sabatini Andrea, Arturi Lucrezia, Abate Roberta, Riccioni Assia, Siracusano Martina, Pereira Marcela, Engstrand Lars, Cristofori Fernanda, Adduce Domenico, Francavilla Ruggiero, Costa-Mattioli Mauro, Hardan Antonio Y","Cell host & microbe","Child, Mice, Animals, Humans, Autistic Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Social Behavior, Treatment Outcome, Double-Blind Method","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38113884","Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.

Here exploratory biological assessments from a completed randomized, placebo-controlled trial showed that children with autism (n = 79, 16 females) receiving intranasal oxytocin for four weeks (12 IU, twice daily) displayed significantly higher salivary oxytocin levels 24 hours after the last oxytocin nasal spray administration, but no longer at a four-week follow up session. Regarding salivary oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) epigenetics (DNA-methylation), oxytocin-induced reductions in OXTR DNA-methylation were observed, suggesting a facilitation of oxytocin receptor expression in the oxytocin compared to the placebo group. Notably, heightened oxytocin levels post-treatment were significantly associated with reduced OXTR DNA-methylation and improved feelings of secure attachment. These findings indicate that four weeks of chronic oxytocin administration stimulated the endogenous oxytocinergic system in children with autism.","Moerkerke Matthijs, Daniels Nicky, Tibermont Laura,

"38170431","10.1007/S10803-023-06198-X","Overview of Meta-Analyses on Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.","2025-01-01","We conducted an overview of reviews to determine the effects of naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions (NDBIs; Schreibman et al. (2015) J Autism Dev Disorders 45:2411-2428) on children with autism spectrum disorder under 8 years old. We conducted an electronic database search of Academic Search Premier, CINHAL, ERIC, Medline, and APA PsycINFO in October 2022 and August 2023 and utilized snowball methods to locate relevant reviews of NDBI. We included reviews meeting the following inclusion criteria: (1) review included a meta-analytic synthesis for at least one child outcome; (2) primary studies examined a NDBI; (3) primary studies included children with ASD with a mean pre-treatment age under eight years; (4) primary studies were conducted using a two-group comparison design; and (5) review was published in English. We extracted data on characteristics of the review, participant characteristics from the primary studies, intervention characteristics, and assessed the risk of bias of the included reviews. We conducted a narrative synthesis across outcomes reported in the included reviews. We included five reviews from six reports in this overview. Two reviews included studies that examined the Early Start Denver Model, two reviews included studies that examined the Pivotal Response Treatment, and one review included studies examining NDBIs collectively. We found positive effects of NDBIs on child's communication/language, cognition, and adaptive behavior. We found mixed effects for NDBIs on autism symptomatology and restricted and repetitive behaviors. Examination of moderator analyses reported in the included reviews suggested variables influencing the effects of NDBIs included proximity of outcome to intervention, boundedness of outcome to intervention, and study location. As shown in this overview, positive effects of NDBI for young children with ASD are supported by meta-analytic evidence. While the overall findings for NDBI across reviews are positive, the findings on specific outcomes and influential variables moderating the effects of NDBI are inconsistent. Additional evidence from randomized controlled trials and future meta-analyses are needed to strengthen our knowledge of the effects of NDBI for young children with ASD.Protocol Registration: PROSPERO CRD42022353045.","Song Jinwei, Reilly Molly, Reichow Brian","Journal of autism and developmental disorders","Humans, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Child, Child, Preschool, Meta-Analysis as Topic","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38170431","A.

"38216125","10.1093/Jpepsy/Jsad093","A pilot, single-arm feasibility study of an integrated cognitive-behavioral treatment for anxiety in young autistic children.","2024-02-17","Anxiety is prevalent in young autistic children under 7 years of age. Yet there is a paucity of empirically based interventions for this age group. DINO Strategies for Anxiety and Uncertainty Reduction (DINOSAUR) is an innovative cognitive behavioral intervention that seeks to optimize treatment response in young autistic children by targeting anxiety and the contributing mechanisms of intolerance of uncertainty and parental accommodation using a telehealth delivery model. This pilot, single-arm study examines the preliminary feasibility of DINOSAUR. Fourteen autistic children ages 4-6 years with average language and cognitive skills and their parents received the intervention. Quantitative and qualitative data pertaining to parent satisfaction and treatment outcomes were collected. Attendance, retention, and parent satisfaction ratings offer preliminary support for the feasibility of the treatment model. Change in clinical severity ratings on a semi-structured parent interview of anxiety and parents' qualitative report suggests the potential to benefit young autistic children. Results support future study of the DINOSAUR model in a larger, randomized controlled trial.","Keefer Amy, Perrin Jeremy, Singh Vini, Holingue Calliope, Winchell Sarah, Vasa Roma A","Journal of

Benefiting the ability to communicate in RTT is often identified as the most important caregiver goal for new therapies. This analysis reports the communication-related end points from the phase 3 LAVENDER study of trofinetide in RTT. Females with RTT, aged five to 20 years, were randomized 1:1 to trofinetide or placebo for 12 weeks. Secondary efficacy end points related to communication were based on change from baseline to week 12 and included the caregiver-rated Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales Developmental Profile™ Infant-Toddler Checklist (CSBS-DP-IT) Social Composite score (key secondary end point; scores ranged from 0 to 26 [higher scores indicated better communication]) and novel clinician rating scales (0 [normal] to 7 [severe impairment]) measuring the ability to communicate choices nonverbally (RTT-COMC) and verbally (RTT-VCOM). Trofinetide demonstrated a statistically significant difference versus placebo for the CSBS-DP-IT Social Composite score (least squares mean [LSM] difference = 1.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.3 to 1.7; P = 0.0064; Cohen's d effect size = 0.43) and a nominally significant difference for the RTT-COMC (LSM difference: -0.3; 95% CI, -0.6 to -0.0; P = 0.0257; Cohen's d effect size = 0.36). As expected, there was no difference for the RTT-VCOM. Significant treatment benefit for trofinetide versus placebo was observed in scales measuring the ability to communicate. These scales may be appropriate for future clinical studies in RTT and other neurodevelopmental disorders.","Neul Jeffrey L, Percy Alan K, Benke Timothy A, Berry-Kravis Elizabeth M, Glaze Daniel G, Peters Sarika U, Marsh Eric D, An Di, Bishop Kathie M, Youakim James M","Pediatric neurology","United States, Female, Infant, Humans, Rett Syndrome, Glutamates, Caregivers","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38232652","Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc, San Diego, California.

We aimed to appraise the magnitude of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for irritability in ASD without any restrictions in terms of eligible interventions. We systematically searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science until April 15, 2023. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a parallel design that examined the efficacy of interventions for the treatment of irritability in patients of any age with ASD without any restrictions in terms of eligible interventions. We performed a random-effects meta-analysis by pooling effect sizes as Hedges' g. We classified assessed interventions as follows: pharmacological monotherapy, risperidone plus adjuvant therapy versus risperidone monotherapy, non-pharmacological intervention, and dietary intervention. We utilized the Cochrane tool to evaluate the risk of bias in each study and the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for each meta-analyzed intervention. Out of 5640 references, we identified 60 eligible articles with 45 different kinds of interventions, including 3531 participants, of which 80.9% were males (mean age [SD] = 8.79 [3.85]). For pharmacological monotherapy, risperidone (Hedges' g - 0.857, 95% CI - 1.263 to - 0.451, certainty of evidence: high) and aripiprazole (Hedges' g - 0.559, 95% CI - 0.767 to - 0.351, certainty of evidence: high) outperformed placebo. Among the non-pharmacological interventions, parent training (Hedges' g - 0.893, 95% CI - 1.184 to - 0.602, certainty of evidence: moderate) showed a significant result. None of the meta-analyzed interventions yielded significant effects among risperidone + adjuvant therapy and dietary supplementation. However, several novel molecules in augmentation to risperidone outperformed risperidone monotherapy, yet from one RCT each. First, various tools have been utilized to measure the irritability in ASD, which may contribute to the heterogeneity of the outcomes. Second, meta-analyses for each intervention included only a small number of studies and participants. Only risperidone, aripiprazole among pharmacological interventions, and parent training among non-pharmacological interventions can be recommended for irritability in ASD. As an augmentation to risperidone, several novel treatments show promising effects, but further RCTs are needed to replicate findings.

Thirty individuals with ASD were randomly divided into three groups receiving 2 mA, 20 minutes daily anodal tDCS for 10 sessions. Group A received 10 sham tDCS sessions, group B five real followed by five sham sessions, and group C received 10 real tDCS sessions. The total score of non-verbal intelligence was measured using the Test of Nonverbal Intelligence, Fourth Edition. The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (LDLPFC) was targeted using the International 10-20 electroencephalography system, and concurrent cognitive training was avoided. Group C demonstrated a mean difference of 4.10 (95% confidence interval 1.41-6.79; p = 0.005) in Test of Nonverbal Intelligence scores compared with group A, with an effect size of 0.47. No significant differences were observed between groups A and B (p = 0.296), or between groups B and C (p = 0.140). Ten sessions of anodal tDCS to the LDLPFC led to improved non-verbal intelligence among individuals with ASD. These results emphasize the potential of tDCS as a discrete method for boosting cognitive abilities in the high-functioning population with ASD. Future studies with larger groups of participants and extended observation periods are necessary to validate these findings.","Ratsapbhayakul Tinnaphat, Keeratitanont Keattichai, Chonprai Chanatiporn, Auvichayapat Narong, Suphakunpinyo Chanyut, Patjanasoontorn Niramol, Tiamkao Somsak, Tunkamnerdthai Orathai, Punjaruk Wiyada, Auvichayapat Paradee","Developmental medicine and child neurology","Humans, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation, Male, Female, Intelligence, Young Adult, Adult, Adolescent, Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, Treatment Outcome, Electroencephalography","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38308445","Noninvasive Brain Stimulation Research Group of Thailand, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.; Division of Child Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.",

"38400592","10.1111/Jcpp.13966","Chronic oxytocin improves neural decoupling at rest in children with autism: an exploratory RCT.","2024-10-01","Shifts in peak frequencies of oscillatory neural rhythms are put forward as a principal mechanism by which cross-frequency coupling/decoupling is implemented in the brain. During active neural processing, functional integration is facilitated through transitory formations of ""harmonic"" cross-frequency couplings, whereas ""nonharmonic"" decoupling among neural oscillatory rhythms is postulated to characterize the resting, default state of the brain, minimizing the occurrence of spurious, noisy, background couplings. Within this exploratory, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we assessed whether the transient occurrence of nonharmonic and harmonic relationships between peak-frequencies in the alpha (8-14 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) bands is impacted by intranasal administration of oxytocin, a neuromodulator implicated in improving homeostasis and reducing stress/anxiety. To do so, resting-state electroencephalography was acquired before and after 4 weeks of oxytocin administration (12 IU twice-daily) in children with autism spectrum disorder (8-12 years, n = 33 oxytocin; n = 34 placebo). At the baseline, neural assessments of children with autism were compared with those of a matched cohort of children without autism (n = 40). Compared to nonautistic peers, autistic children displayed a lower incidence of nonharmonic alpha-theta cross-frequency decoupling, indicating a higher incidence of spurious ""noisy"" coupling in their resting brain (p = .001). Dimensionally, increased neural coupling was associated with more social difficulties (p = .002) and lower activity of the parasympathetic ""rest & digest"" branch of the autonomic nervous system (p = .018), indexed with high-frequency heart-rate-variability. Notably, after oxytocin administration, the transient formation of nonharmonic cross-frequency configurations was increased in the cohort of autistic children (p < .001), indicating a beneficial effect of oxytocin on reducing spurious cross-frequency-interactions. Furthermore, parallel epigenetics changes of the oxytocin receptor gene indicated that the neural effects were likely mediated by changes in endogenous oxytocinergic signaling (p = .006). Chronic oxytocin induced important homeostatic changes in the resting-state intrinsic neural frequency architecture, reflective of reduced noisy oscillatory couplings and improved signal-to-noise properties.","Alaerts Kaat, Moerkerke Matthijs, Daniels Nicky, Zhang Qianqian, Grazia Ricchiuti, Steyaert Jean, Prinsen Jellina, Boets Bart","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","Humans, Oxytocin, Child, Male, Female, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Administration, Intranasal, Theta Rhythm, Alpha Rhythm, Electroencephalography","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38400592","Research Group for Neurorehabilitation, Neuromodulation Laboratory, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.; Leuven Autism Research (LAuRes), KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.",

The goal of the present study was to conduct a randomized controlled trial of a 12-week social intervention (SUCCESS), which combined an inclusive social group with a parent education program. Twenty-five 4- to 6-year-olds with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) were randomized to SUCCESS (N = 11) or to treatment as usual (N = 14). Combining a peer group model with a parent training program, the SUCCESS intervention used naturalistic behavioral techniques (e.g., environmental arrangement, natural reinforcement) to increase social initiations to peers. After 12 weeks, children participating in the SUCCESS program made more frequent initiations to peers than children in the treatment-as-usual group, including more prompted and unprompted initiations to request. Additional gains in clinician-rated social functioning were observed in children randomized to SUCCESS, while differential treatment effects were not detected in parent-rated measures. However, lower baseline social motivation was associated with greater parent-reported initiation improvement. This study provides preliminary support for the efficacy of a naturalistic, behavioral social skills intervention to improve peer initiations for children with ASD. The findings suggest that using a motivation-based social skills group was effective in increasing both prompted and spontaneous initiations to peers, and highlights the need for further research into the role of baseline social motivation in predicting social skills treatment response.","Shkel Jane, Geng Alicia, Pilchak Elise, Millan Maria Estefania, Schwartzman Jessica M, Schuck Rachel, Bundang

"38467434","10.1523/Jneurosci.1218-23.2024","Retinal GABAergic Alterations in Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder.","2024-04-03","Alterations in γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) have been implicated in sensory differences in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Visual signals are initially processed in the retina, and in this study, we explored the hypotheses that the GABA-dependent retinal response to light is altered in individuals with ASD. Light-adapted electroretinograms were recorded from 61 adults (38 males and 23 females; <i>n</i> = 22 ASD) in response to three stimulus protocols: (1) the standard white flash, (2) the standard 30 Hz flickering protocol, and (3) the photopic negative response protocol. Participants were administered an oral dose of placebo, 15 or 30 mg of arbaclofen (STX209, GABA<sub>B</sub> agonist) in a randomized, double-blind, crossover order before the test. At baseline (placebo), the a-wave amplitudes in response to single white flashes were more prominent in ASD, relative to typically developed (TD) participants. Arbaclofen was associated with a decrease in the a-wave amplitude in ASD, but an increase in TD, eliminating the group difference observed at baseline. The extent of this arbaclofen-elicited shift significantly correlated with the arbaclofen-elicited shift in cortical responses to auditory stimuli as measured by using an electroencephalogram in our prior study and with broader autistic traits measured with the autism quotient across the whole cohort. Hence, GABA-dependent differences in retinal light processing in ASD appear to be an accessible component of a wider autistic difference in the central processing of sensory information, which may be upstream of more complex autistic phenotypes.","Huang Qiyun, Ellis Claire L, Leo Shaun M, Velthuis Hester, Pereira Andreia C, Dimitrov Mihail, Ponteduro Francesca M, Wong Nichol M L, Daly Eileen, Murphy Declan G M, Mahroo Omar A, McAlonan Gráinne M","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","Male, Adult, Female, Humans, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Retina, Electroencephalography, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid, Electroretinography","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38467434","Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London SE5 8AF, United Kingdom grainne.mcalonan@kcl.ac.uk.; Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London EC1V 2PD, United Kingdom.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London SE5 8AF, United Kingdom.",

It was hypothesized that Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback (HRVB) increases cardiac vagal modulation in adolescents with autism, resulting in positive effects on physiological and psychosocial parameters. It was also hypothesized that home-based HRVB training is feasible. In a single-blind, randomized sham-controlled pilot trial, adolescents with autism performed supervised HRVB (n = 24) or sham training (n = 20). Subsequently, half of the adolescents received HRVB training at home, whereas the other subset did not practice. Physiological, cortisol and behavioral data were collected during stress-provoking assessments before and after each training period. Supervised HRVB resulted in a late increase in cardiac vagal modulation in adolescents with autism. Heart rate increased and cortisol decreased significantly immediately after supervised HRVB, but none of these effects remained after follow-up. Following supervised HRVB, no significant change in psychosocial functioning was found. Home-based HRVB was feasible, adolescents reported lower symptoms of stress, but a significant decrease in compliance rate was found. HRVB is feasible and effective in adolescents with autism given the late-emerging increases in cardiac vagal modulation and decrease in stress symptoms. Replicating this study with a larger sample and further exploration of the working mechanisms of HRVB are recommended.

"38492129","10.1007/S11682-024-00874-X","Lack of effects of eight-week left dorsolateral prefrontal theta burst stimulation on white matter macro/microstructure and connection in autism.","2024-08-01","Whether brain stimulation could modulate brain structure in autism remains unknown. This study explored the impact of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on white matter macro/microstructure in intellectually able children and emerging adults with autism. Sixty autistic participants were randomized (30 active) and received active or sham cTBS for eight weeks twice per week, 16 total sessions using a double-blind (participant-, rater-, analyst-blinded) design. All participants received high-angular resolution diffusion MR imaging at baseline and week 8. Twenty-eight participants in the active group and twenty-seven in the sham group with good imaging quality entered the final analysis. With longitudinal fixel-based analysis and network-based statistics, we found no significant difference between the active and sham groups in changes of white matter macro/microstructure and connections following cTBS. In addition, we found no association between baseline white matter macro/microstructure and autistic symptom changes from baseline to week 8 in the active group. In conclusion, we did not find a significant impact of left DLPFC cTBS on white matter macro/microstructure and connections in children and emerging adults with autism. These findings need to be interpreted in the context that the current intellectually able cohort in a single university hospital site limits the generalizability. Future studies are required to investigate if higher stimulation intensities and/or doses, other personal factors, or rTMS parameters might confer significant brain structural changes visible on MRI in ASD.","Yeh Chun-Hung, Lin Po-Chun, Tseng Rung-Yu, Chao Yi-Ping, Wu Chen-Te, Chou Tai-Li, Chen Rou-Shayn, Gau Susan Shur-Fen, Ni Hsing-Chang, Lin Hsiang-Yuan","Brain imaging and behavior","Humans,

It facilitates empathy, emotion regulation, and prosocial commitment. Mental disorders characterized by social interaction dysfunction, such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD), and Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), often exhibit atypical synchronization with others across multiple levels. With the introduction of the ""second-person"" neuroscience perspective, our understanding of interpersonal neural synchronization (INS) has improved, however, so far, it has hardly impacted the development of novel therapeutic interventions. To evaluate the potential of INS-based treatments for mental disorders, we performed two systematic literature searches identifying studies that directly target INS through neurofeedback (12 publications; 9 independent studies) or brain stimulation techniques (7 studies), following PRISMA guidelines. In addition, we narratively review indirect INS manipulations through behavioral, biofeedback, or hormonal interventions. We discuss the potential of such treatments for ASD, RAD, and SAD and using a systematic database search assess the acceptability of neurofeedback (4 studies) and neurostimulation (4 studies) in patients with social dysfunction. Although behavioral approaches, such as engaging in eye contact or cooperative actions, have been shown to be associated with increased INS, little is known about potential long-term consequences of such interventions. Few proof-of-concept studies have utilized brain stimulation techniques, like transcranial direct current stimulation or INS-based neurofeedback, showing feasibility and preliminary evidence that such interventions can boost behavioral synchrony and social connectedness. Yet, optimal brain stimulation protocols and neurofeedback parameters are still undefined. For ASD, RAD, or SAD, so far no randomized controlled trial has proven the efficacy of direct INS-based intervention techniques, although in general brain stimulation and neurofeedback methods seem to be well accepted in these patient groups. Significant work remains to translate INS-based manipulations into effective treatments for social interaction disorders. Future research should focus on mechanistic insights into INS, technological advancements, and rigorous design standards. Furthermore, it will be key to compare interventions directly targeting INS to those targeting other modalities of synchrony as well as to define optimal target dyads and target synchrony states in clinical interventions.","Konrad Kerstin, Gerloff Christian, Kohl Simon H, Mehler David M A, Mehlem Lena, Volbert Emily L, Komorek Maike, Henn Alina T, Boecker Maren, Weiss Eileen, Reindl Vanessa","Frontiers in neuroscience",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38529267","Child Neuropsychology Section, Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy, University Hospital RWTH, Aachen, Germany.; Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, Medical School, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.",

However, the administration of exogenous OXT in humans produces inconsistent behavioral changes, affecting future consideration of OXT as a treatment for autism and other disorders with social symptoms. Inter-individual variability in social functioning traits might play a key role in how OXT changes brain activity and, therefore, behavior. Here, we investigated if inter-individual variability might dictate how single-dose intranasal OXT administration (IN-OXT) changes spontaneous neural activity during the eyes-open resting state. We used a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over design on 30 typically developing young adult men to investigate the dynamics of EEG microstates corresponding to activity in defined neural networks. We confirmed previous reports that, at the group level, IN-OXT increases the representation of the attention and salience microstates. Furthermore, we identified a decreased representation of microstates associated with the default mode network. Using multivariate partial least square statistical analysis, we found that social functioning traits associated with IN-OXT-induced changes in microstate dynamics in specific spectral bands. Correlation analysis further revealed that the higher the social functioning, the more IN-OXT increased the appearance of the visual network-associated microstate, and suppressed the appearance of a default mode network-related microstate. The lower the social functioning, the more IN-OXT increases the appearance of the salience microstate. The effects we report on the salience microstate support the hypothesis that OXT regulates behavior by enhancing social salience. Moreover, our findings indicate that social functioning traits modulate responses to IN-OXT and could partially explain the inconsistent reports on IN-OXT effects.","Tomescu Miralena I, Van der Donck Stephanie, Perisanu Emanuela M, Berceanu Alexandru I, Alaerts Kaat, Boets Bart, Carcea Ioana","Psychophysiology","Humans, Oxytocin, Administration, Intranasal, Male, Double-Blind Method, Young Adult, Cross-Over Studies, Adult, Electroencephalography, Social Behavior, Nerve Net","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38594888","Faculty of Educational Sciences, Department of Psychology, University ""Stefan cel Mare"" of Suceava, Bucharest, Romania.; Center for Developmental Psychiatry, Department of Neurosciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.; CINETic Center, National University of Theatre and Film ""I.L.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) <i>v.</i> treatment as usual (TAU) in reducing suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. At six Dutch mental health centers, 123 outpatients (18-65 years) with DSM-5 diagnosed autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and suicidal behavior were randomly assigned to the DBT intervention group (<i>n</i> = 63) or TAU control group (<i>n</i> = 60). Assessments were conducted at baseline, post-treatment at 6 months and 12-month follow-up. The primary outcomes were severity of suicidal ideation and frequency of suicide attempts. The severity of depression and social anxiety were secondary outcomes. At end-of-treatment, DBT significantly reduced both suicidal ideation (<i>z</i> = -2.24; <i>p</i> = 0.025; <i>b</i> = -4.41; s.e. = 197.0) and suicide attempts (<i>z</i> = -3.15; <i>p</i> = 0.002; <i>IRR</i> = 0.046; s.e. = 0.045) compared to TAU, but lost statistical significance at the 12-month follow-up. Depression severity significantly decreased with DBT (<i>z</i> = -1.99; <i>p</i> = 0.046: <i>b</i> = -2.74; s.e. = 1.37) remaining so at 12 months (<i>z</i> = -2.46; <i>p</i> = 0.014; <i>b</i> = -3.37; s.e. = 1.37). No effects were observed on social anxiety. Severe adverse events included two suicides in the TAU condition. DBT is an acceptable, safe, and short-term effective intervention to reduce suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in autistic adults with suicidal behavior.","Huntjens Anne, van den Bosch L M C Wies,

"38664754","10.1186/S12887-024-04752-9","Comparison of the efficacy of parent-mediated NDBIs on developmental skills in children with ASD and fidelity in parents: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.","2024-04-25","Recently, studies on behavioral interventions for autism have gained popularity. Naturalistic Developmental Behavior Interventions (NDBIs) are among the most effective, evidence-based, and widely used behavior interventions for autism. However, no research has been conducted on which of the several NDBI methods is most effective for parents and children with autism spectrum disorders. Therefore, we conducted a network meta-analysis to compare the specific effects of each type of parental-mediated NDBI on children's developmental skills and parent fidelity. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Medline, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), CINAHL, and Wanfang databases were searched from inception to August 30, 2023. A total of 32 randomized controlled trial studies that examined the efficacy of different NDBIs were included. Parents of children with ASD who received Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT) reported significant improvements in their children's social skills (SUCRA, 74.1%), language skills (SUCRA, 88.3%), and parenting fidelity (SUCRA, 99.5%). Moreover, parents who received Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) reported significant improvements in their children's language (SMD = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.79) and motor skills (SMD = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.79). In terms of the efficacy of improving parent fidelity, the results showed that the Improving Parents as Communication Teachers (ImPACT) intervention significantly improved parent fidelity when compared with the treatment-as-usual group (TAU) (SMD = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.39, 1.42) and the parental education intervention (PEI) (SMD = 1.10, 95% CI:0.28, 1.91).There was a difference in parent fidelity among parents who received PRT(SMD = 3.53, 95% CI: 2.26, 4.79) or ESDM(SMD = 1.42, 95% CI: 0.76, 2.09) training compared with PEI. In conclusion, this study revealed that parents can achieve high fidelity with the ImPACT intervention, and it can serve as an early first step for children newly diagnosed with ASD. It also showed that parent-mediated ESDM is effective in improving language and motor skills for children with ASD and can be used as part of the second stage of parent training. Parent-mediated PRT can also be used as a third stage of parent training with sufficient training intensity to further improve language, social, and motor skills.","Ouyang Yuling, Feng Junyan, Wang

In this study, 87 autistic youth (7 to 13 years old) with anxiety disorders and their parents were randomized to two forms of parent-led CBT in which parents led their child through a guided CBT workbook across 12 weeks: one with low therapist contact (four 30-minute telehealth calls), and one with standard therapist contact (ten 60-minute telehealth calls). Anxiety, functional impairment, and autism features significantly declined across therapy, without differences between groups. High satisfaction was reported in both groups, though significantly higher satisfaction ratings were reported in standard-contact CBT. Responder rates were 69% of completers at posttreatment (70% in standard contact, 68% in low contact) and 86% at 3-month follow-up (86% in standard contact, 87% in low contact). Low-contact CBT was estimated to incur an average cost of $755.70 per family compared with $1,978.34 in standard-contact CBT. Parent-led CBT with minimal or standard therapist contact both appear to be effective CBT delivery formats for autistic youth with anxiety disorders, with significant cost savings for low-contact CBT.","Guzick Andrew G, Schneider Sophie C, Kook Minjee, Rose Iacono Julia, Weinzimmer Saira A, Quast Troy, Olsen Sean M, Hughes Killian Rainey, Jellinek-Russo Emily, Garcia Amanda Perozo, Candelari Abigail, Berry Leandra N, Goin-Kochel Robin P, Goodman Wayne K, Storch Eric A","Behavior therapy","Humans, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Male, Female, Adolescent, Child, Parents, Anxiety Disorders, Telemedicine, Autistic Disorder, Treatment Outcome, Anxiety, Patient Satisfaction, Mental Health Teletherapy","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38670664","Baylor College of Medicine.; Baylor College of Medicine; University of Houston.; Baylor College of Medicine, Meyer Center for Developmental Pediatrics and Autism, Texas Children's Hospital.; University of Pennsylvania; Baylor College of Medicine.

Comparison of their efficacy were assessed using ISAA as primary outcome measure. This study was a parallel arm, open label, randomized active- controlled non-inferiority clinical trial. 50 Children diagnosed with ASD were randomized into FMI and EIBI groups. Clinical status was checked by using Indian scale for assessment of autism (ISAA), Oro- motor and sensory profile at baseline, after three and six months. Difference between change in mean ISAA score between FMI and EIBI group at the end of 6 months as per protocol (PP) analysis was -7.23 (CI=-18.41, 3.94), which was within pre-defined clinically relevant non-inferiority (NI) margin of - 24. FMI was found to be non-inferior to EIBI at the end of 6 months as the lower bound of 95% CI (-18.41) for ISAA score was higher than NI margin. ISAA scores were found to be statistically lower in both FMI and EIBI groups at the end point compared to baseline which indicated improvement in symptom severity. FMI was non-inferior to EIBI as therapy for children with ASD at the end of six months. Finding also indicated longer duration of treatment is required for FMI to be superior. FMI can be recommended for children with ASD in view of improved ISAA scores reported in our study.

The combination of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and inhibitory control training produces good transfer effects and improves neuroplasticity. However, no studies have explored whether applying tDCS over the dlPFC improves inhibitory control and produces transfer effects in children with ASD. To explore whether multisession tDCS could enhance inhibitory control training (response inhibition), near-transfer (interference control) and far-transfer effects (sustained attention; stability of attention) in children with ASD and the generalizability of training effects in daily life and the class, as reflected by behavioral performance and neural activity measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Twenty-eight autistic children were randomly assigned to either the true or sham tDCS group. The experimental group received bifrontal tDCS stimulation at 1.5 mA, administered for 15 min daily across eight consecutive days. tDCS was delivered during a computerized Go/No-go training task. Behavioral performance in terms of inhibitory control (Dog/Monkey and Day/Night Stroop tasks), sustained attention (Continuous Performance and Cancellation tests), prefrontal cortex (PFC) neural activity and inhibitory control and sustained attention in the class and at home were evaluated. Training (response inhibition) and transfer effects (interference control; sustained attention) were significantly greater after receiving tDCS during the Go/No-go training task than after receiving sham tDCS. Changes in oxyhemoglobin (HbO) concentrations in the dlPFC and FPA associated with consistent conditions in the Day/Night Stroop and Continuous Performance test were observed after applying tDCS during the inhibitory control training task. Notably, transfer effects can be generalized to classroom environments. Inhibitory control training combined with tDCS may be a promising, safe, and effective method for improving inhibitory control and sustained attention in children with ASD.","Chen Liu, Du Bang, Li Ke, Li Kaiyun, Hou TingTing, Jia Fanlu, Li Li","Brain stimulation","Humans, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation, Male, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared, Female, Child, Attention, Inhibition, Psychological, Transfer, Psychology, Prefrontal Cortex","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38697468","BoShan Special Education Center School, 255299, Zibo, China.; School of Education and Psychology, University of Jinan, 250022, Jinan, China.; School of Education and Psychology, University of Jinan, 250022, Jinan, China.

However, studies investigating maternal selenium in relation to child neurodevelopmental disorders are scarce. 719 mother-child pairs from the prospective population-based Odense Child Cohort study in Denmark were included. Three selenium biomarkers, i.e. concentrations of serum selenium, selenoprotein P (SELENOP), and activity of glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3), along with serum copper, zinc and iron were measured in early third trimester (at 28.9+/-0.8 weeks of pregnancy). ADHD and ASD traits in children were assessed systematically using the established Child Behaviour Checklist at 5 years of age, based on a Danish reference cohort with cut-off at 90th percentile. Multivariable regression models adjusted for biologically relevant confounders were applied. 155 of 719 (21.6 %) children had ASD traits and 59 of 719 (8.2 %) children had traits of ADHD at 5 years of age. In crude and adjusted models, all three selenium biomarkers associated inversely with ADHD traits. For ADHD, fully adjusted OR for 10 μg/L increment in selenium was 0.76 (95 % CI 0.60, 0.94), for one mg/L increment in SELENOP was 0.73 (0.56, 0.95), and for 10 U/L increment in GPx3 was 0.93 (0.87,1.00). Maternal total selenium was inversely associated with child ASD traits, OR per 10 μg/L increment was 0.85 (0.74, 0,98). SELENOP and GPx3 were not associated with ASD traits. The associations were specific to selenium, as other trace elements such as copper, zinc, or iron were not associated with the outcomes. The results provide coherent evidence for selenium deficiency as a risk factor for ADHD and ASD traits in an environment with borderline supply, the causality of which should be elucidated in a randomized controlled trial.","Demircan Kamil, Chillon Thilo Samson, Jensen Richard Christian, Jensen Tina Kold, Sun Qian, Bonnema Steen Joop, Glintborg Dorte, Bilenberg Niels, Andersen Marianne Skovsager, Schomburg Lutz","Free radical biology & medicine","Humans, Selenium, Female, Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity, Pregnancy, Glutathione Peroxidase, Male, Denmark, Child, Preschool, Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects, Selenoprotein P, Adult, Biomarkers, Prospective Studies, Autistic Disorder, Cohort Studies, Child, Zinc, Copper","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38704054","Institute for Experimental Endocrinology, Max Rubner Center (MRC) for Cardiovascular Metabolic Renal Research, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.; Department of Clinical Research, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark; Department of Child and Adolescent Mental Health, Mental Health Services in the Region of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.; Institute for Experimental Endocrinology, Max Rubner Center (MRC) for Cardiovascular Metabolic Renal Research, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.

"38719439","10.1111/Jcpp.13994","Examining variability in Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Intervention strategy use in caregivers of children with autism spectrum disorders.","2025-01-01","Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBIs) for young children with autism spectrum disorder commonly involve caregiver-mediated approaches. However, to date, there is limited research on how caregivers' skills change, and, in turn, impact child outcomes. We evaluated the NDBI strategy use of 191 caregivers prior to participation in NDBIs (or control groups) across multiple randomized controlled trials, using the Measure of NDBI Strategy Implementation, Caregiver Change (MONSI-CC). Clustering analyses were used to examine caregiver variability in NDBI strategy use at intervention entry. Generalized Linear Mixed Models were used to examine changes in caregiver strategy use over the course of intervention and its impact on changes in children's social communication. Using clustering analysis, we found that caregivers' baseline skills fit four profiles: limited, emerging, variable, and consistent/high, with few demographic factors distinguishing these groups. Caregivers starting with limited or emerging skills improved in their strategy use with intervention. Caregivers starting with more skills (consistent/high or variable) maintained higher skills over intervention. Children of caregivers in these groups who received target NDBIs improved in their social communication skills. Results suggested that caregiver skills improve through participation in NDBIs and may directly contribute to their children's outcomes, although more research on mediating factors is needed. Individualized approaches for caregivers and their children starting with differing skill profiles at intervention entry may be warranted.","Brown Hallie, Swain Deanna, Kim Hye Won, Rogers Sally,

We studied the use of accelerated theta burst stimulation (ATBS) for the treatment of refractory MDD in ASD (3 treatments daily x 10 days). This prospective open-label 12-week trial included 10 subjects with a mean age of 21.5 years, randomized to receive unilateral or bilateral stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. One participant dropped out of the study due to intolerability. In both treatment arms, depressive symptoms, scored on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores, diminished substantially. At 12 weeks post-treatment, full remission was sustained in 5 subjects and partial remission in 3 subjects. Treatment with ATBS, regardless of the site of stimulation, was associated with a significant, substantial, and sustained improvement in depressive symptomatology via the primary outcome measure, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Additional secondary measures, including self-report depression scales, fluid cognition, and sleep quality, also showed significant improvement. No serious adverse events occurred during the study. Mild transient headaches were infrequently reported, which are expected side effects of ATBS. Overall, ATBS treatment was highly effective and well-tolerated in individuals with ASD and co-occurring MDD. The findings support the need for a larger, sham-controlled randomized controlled trial to further evaluate efficacy of ATBS in this population.","Blank Elizabeth, Gilbert Donald L, Wu Steve W, Larsh

"38816827","10.1186/S12913-024-11033-9","Utility of a virtual small group cognitive behaviour program for autistic children during the pandemic: evidence from a community-based implementation study.","2024-05-30","Autistic children often experience socioemotional difficulties relating to emotion regulation and mental health problems. Supports for autistic children involve the use of adapted interventions that target emotion regulation and social skills, alongside mental health symptoms. The Secret Agent Society Small Group (SAS: SG), an adapted cognitive behavioural program, has demonstrated efficacy through lab-delivered randomized control trials. However, research is still needed on its effectiveness when delivered by publicly funded, community-based autism providers under real-world ecologically valid conditions, especially within the context of a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted access to community-based supports and services for autistic children, and programs have adapted their services to online platforms. However, questions remain about the feasibility and clinical utility of evidence-based interventions and services delivered virtually in community-based settings. The 9-week SAS: SG program was delivered virtually by seven community-based autism service providers during 2020-2021. The program included the use of computer-based games, role-playing tasks, and home missions. Caregivers completed surveys at three timepoints: pre-, post-intervention, and after a 3-month follow-up session. Surveys assessed caregivers' perception of the program's acceptability and level of satisfaction, as well as their child's social and emotional regulation skills and related mental health challenges. A total of 77 caregivers (94% gender identity females; Mean = 42.1 years, SD = 6.5 years) and their children (79% gender identity males; Mean = 9.9 years, SD = 1.3 years) completed the SAS: SG program. Caregivers agreed that the program was acceptable (95%) and were highly satisfied (90%). Caregivers reported significant reduction in their child's emotion reactivity from pre- to post-intervention (-1.78 (95% CI, -3.20 to -0.29), p = 0.01, d = 0.36), that continued to decrease after the 3-month booster session (-1.75 (95% CI, -3.34 to -0.16), p = 0.02, d = 0.33). Similarly, improvements in anxiety symptoms were observed (3.05 (95% CI, 0.72 to 5.36), p = 0.006, d = 0.39). As online delivery of interventions for autistic children remains popular past the pandemic, our findings shed light on future considerations for community-based services, including therapists and agency leaders, on how best to tailor and optimally deliver virtually based programming. This study has been registered with ISRCTN Registry (ISRCTN98068608) on 15/09/2023.

Rett syndrome is a chronic disorder requiring long-term treatment. We report the efficacy and safety results of LILAC, a 40-week, open-label extension study of LAVENDER. Females with Rett syndrome aged 5-21 years received open-label treatment with trofinetide for 40 weeks. The primary endpoint was long-term safety of trofinetide; secondary endpoints included the change from baseline at week 40 in the Rett Syndrome Behaviour Questionnaire score and the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement score at week 40. Overall, 154 participants were enrolled and treated with trofinetide in LILAC. The most common adverse events in LILAC were diarrhea (74.7%), vomiting (28.6%), and COVID-19 (11.0%). Diarrhea was the most common adverse event leading to treatment withdrawal (21.4%). The Rett Syndrome Behaviour Questionnaire mean score (standard error) improvement from the LAVENDER baseline to week 40 in LILAC was -7.3 (1.62) and -7.0 (1.61) for participants treated with trofinetide and placebo in LAVENDER, respectively. Mean Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scores (standard error) at week 40 rated from the LILAC baseline were 3.1 (0.11) and 3.2 (0.14) for participants treated with trofinetide and placebo in LAVENDER, respectively. Treatment with trofinetide for ≤40 weeks continued to improve symptoms of Rett syndrome. Trofinetide had a similar safety profile in LILAC as in LAVENDER. The study was supported by Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. (San Diego, CA, USA).

In a cocreation process with experts and parents, a low-threshold application that uses exercises based on the principles of positive psychology and mindfulness was developed. This application, called ""Adappt,"" aims at enhancing the ability to adapt of the parents and caregivers of children with NDDs and at supporting their mental health. This protocol describes the evaluation study of the effectiveness of Adappt, its core working mechanisms and user experiences. A pragmatic international multicenter randomized controlled trial will compare the effectiveness of Adappt with a (delayed) waitlist control condition. At least 212 parents or primary caregivers of children younger than 18 years diagnosed with or suspected of a NDD will be randomly assigned to the intervention or waitlist control condition. Participants are excluded if they have severe anxiety or depression levels or are in treatment for mental health issues. Measures will be collected online at baseline, post-intervention (1 month after baseline), and 4 and 7 months after baseline. The primary outcome is the improvement in generic sense of ability to adapt as measured with the Generic Sense of Ability to Adapt Scale (GSAAS; (Front Psychol 14:985408, 2023)) at 4-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes are mental well-being, (parental) distress, and client satisfaction with ""Adappt."" Results of this study will contribute to knowledge on the effectiveness of a low-threshold application for parents of children with a NDD in multiple countries. If the application is found to be effective in improving mental health, recommendations will be made for implementation in health care.

"38933955","10.1016/J.Heliyon.2024.E32251","A systematic review of transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment for autism spectrum disorder.","2024-06-15","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a behaviorally defined complex neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by persistent social communication and interaction deficit. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a promising and emerging tool for the intervention of ASD by reducing both core and associate symptoms. Several reviews have been published regarding TMS-based ASD treatment, however, a systematic review on study characteristics, specific stimulating parameters, localization techniques, stimulated targets, behavioral outcomes, and neuroimage biomarker changes is lagged behind since 2018. Here, we performed a systematic search on literatures published after 2018 in PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct. After screening, the final systematic review included 17 articles, composing seven randomized controlled trial studies and ten open-label studies. Two studies are double-blind, while the other studies have a moderate to high risk of bias attributing to inadequate subject- and evaluator-blinding to treatment allocation. Five studies utilize theta-burst stimulation mode, and the others apply repetitive TMS with low frequency (five studies), high frequency (six studies), and combined low and high frequency stimulation (one study). Most researchers prioritize the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal lobe as stimulation target, while parietal lobule, inferior parietal lobule, and posterior superior temporal sulci have also emerged as new targets of attention. One third of the studies use neuronavigation based on anatomical magnetic resonance imaging to locate the stimulation target. After TMS intervention, discernible enhancements across a spectrum of scales are evident in stereotyped behavior, repetitive behavior, and verbal social domains. A comprehensive review of literature spanning the last five years demonstrates the potential of TMS treatment for ASD in ameliorating the clinical core symptoms.","Yuan Li-Xia, Wang Xing-Ke, Yang Chen, Zhang Qiu-Rong, Ma Sheng-Zhi, Zang Yu-Feng, Dong Wen-Qiang","Heliyon",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38933955","School of Physics, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.; Center for Cognition and Brain Disorders, The Affiliated Hospital of Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China.",

To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials to investigate the impact of Immersive VR techniques on the cognitive, social, and emotional skills of under-18 children and adolescents with ASD. Four databases were systematically searched as per ""Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses"" guidelines and assessed six RCTs for further analysis. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess the methodological quality of the studies. Pooled results favoured VR and reported significant differences between experimental and control groups concerning social skills (SMD:1.43; 95 % CI: 0.01-2.84; P: 0.05), emotional skills (SMD: 2.45; 95 % CI: 0.21-4.18; P: 0.03) and cognitive skills. VR offers an array of benefits that make it a promising tool for children and adolescents with ASD to improve their cognitive, social and emotional skills in a safe and supportive setting. However, accessibility, affordability, customization, and cost are also significant aspects to consider when developing and implementing VR-based interventions for ASD.","Mittal Palka, Bhadania Mahati, Tondak Navya, Ajmera Priyansh, Yadav Sapna, Kukreti Aditya, Kalra Sheetal, Ajmera Puneeta","Research in developmental disabilities","Humans, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Adolescent, Child, Social Skills, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Cognition, Emotions, Virtual Reality, Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38941690","School of Allied Health Sciences & Management, Delhi Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research University, New Delhi, India.; School of Physiotherapy, Delhi Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research University, New Delhi, India.; K.K.

"38979764","10.1111/Jir.13171","Feasibility study of a parent-driven intervention for youth with Down syndrome.","2024-09-01","Children with Down syndrome present with behavioural and emotional difficulties, including noncompliance, rule-breaking, emotion dysregulation and delays in executive functioning. Few behavioural interventions have been designed specifically for children with Down syndrome. The Research Units in Behavioral Intervention (RUBI) Parent Training for Disruptive Behaviors is a structured empirically supported parent training programme developed for caregivers of children with autism. This feasibility trial explored the feasibility and acceptability of an abbreviated RUBI intervention with caregivers of children with Down syndrome and identified promising outcome measures to target in future larger clinical trials. A double-blind randomised feasibility pilot clinical trial allocated participants to a behavioural intervention (BEH) or educational (EDU) group. BEH and EDU consisted of five individual sessions over the course of 5 to 8 weeks. Measures were administered to 20 caregivers and their youth with Down syndrome at three time points. Both BEH and EDU were rated as feasible with high parental adherence and acceptable with high treatment satisfaction. Both BEH and EDU demonstrated decreased externalising behaviours, irritability and hyperactivity and improved behavioural regulation in executive functioning over time. No impact was noted on caregiver functioning. The feasibility trial has strong findings regarding feasibility and satisfaction and has promising findings regarding the selection of measures for future trials testing an adapted RUBI programme and an education programme to reduce behavioural challenges in children with Down syndrome. Larger scale clinical trials are needed to confirm promising findings of these feasible treatments.","Stone-Heaberlin M, Blackburn A, Hoffman E K, Esbensen A J","Journal of intellectual disability

We carried out a systematic review for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding NIBS for reducing autistic symptoms (INPLASY202370003). Sixteen articles (N = 709) met the inclusion criteria for network meta-analysis. Effect sizes were reported as standardized mean differences (SMDs) or odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Fourteen active NIBS interventions, including transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and transcranial pulse stimulation were analyzed. Only anodal tDCS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex paired with cathodal tDCS over an extracephalic location (atDCS_F3 + ctDCS_E) significantly improved autistic symptoms compared to sham controls (SMD = - 1.40, 95 %CIs = - 2.67 to - 0.14). None of the NIBS interventions markedly improved social-communication symptoms or restricted/repetitive behaviors in autistic participants. Moreover, no active NIBS interventions exhibited significant dropout rate differences compared to sham controls, and no serious adverse events were reported for any intervention.","Chen Yang-Chieh Brian, Lin Hsiang-Yuan, Wang Liang-Jen, Hung Kuo-Chuan, Brunoni Andre R, Chou Po-Han, Tseng Ping-Tao, Liang Chih-Sung, Tu Yu-Kang, Lin Pao-Yen, Carvalho Andre F, Hsu Chih-Wei, Ni Hsing-Chang","Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews","Humans, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Network Meta-Analysis, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38981573","Department of Psychiatry, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

While cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) applications appear promising, trials to date have largely excluded social communication skill development and have not been designed to include a wider range of emotional challenges. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to pilot a uniquely modified CBT program targeting emotion regulation, including social communication training, and explicitly focusing on the child's areas of circumscribed interest in order to teach skills and promote generalization. Forty participants were randomly assigned to either the CBT group or a waitlist control (WLC) group, resulting in 20 school-aged children in each group. The treatment approach was determined to be feasible and acceptable, and therapy engagement and attendance were reasonably high. Caregivers expressed high satisfaction with the program, qualitatively citing gains in skills such as social problem-solving, emotion identification, and identifying and processing cognitive distortions. The primary outcome of postintervention changes was not significantly different between the groups (CBT vs. WLC). The mean Social Skills Improvement System score decreased by 0.44 points (95% confidence interval [CI]: -5.04, 4.15) in the CBT group and increased by 0.41 points (95% CI: -4.23, 5.04) in the WLC group, and the postintervention changes were not significantly different between the groups (difference: -0.85; 95% CI: -7.29, 5.60; <i>p</i> = .79). The estimated rate of emotional dysregulation episodes decreased by a factor of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.57, 1.56) in the CBT group and increased by a factor of 1.07 (95% CI: 0.51, 2.24) for WLC (<i>p</i> = .74). Among those who reported emotional dysregulation episodes, the mean duration decreased by 1.39 minutes (95% CI: -3.90, 6.67) less for CBT than waitlist (<i>p</i> = .60). Although satisfaction, acceptability, and emotional dysregulation outcome results from this preliminary CBT treatment for ASD are promising, sample size and measurement limitations will be important considerations to inform future trials.","Birtwell Kirstin, Goldin Rachel, Saro Hannah, McDougle Christopher, Horick Nora, Ravichandran Caitlin, Nowinski Lisa","Journal of cognitive

"38999736","10.3390/Nu16131988","Modulation of Gut Microbiome and Autism Symptoms of ASD Children Supplemented with Biological Response Modifier: A Randomized, Double-Blinded, Placebo-Controlled Pilot Study.","2024-06-21","The etiology and mechanisms of autism and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are not yet fully understood. There is currently no treatment for ASD for providing significant improvement in core symptoms. Recent studies suggest, however, that ASD is associated with gut dysbiosis, indicating that modulation of gut microbiota in children with ASD may thus reduce the manifestation of ASD symptoms. The aim of this pilot study (prospective randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled) was to evaluate efficacy of the biological response modifier Juvenil in modulating the microbiome of children with ASD and, in particular, whether Juvenil is able to alleviate the symptoms of ASD. In total, 20 children with ASD and 12 neurotypical children were included in our study. Supplementation of ASD children lasted for three months. To confirm Juvenil's impact on the gut microbiome, stool samples were collected from all children and the microbiome's composition was analyzed. This pilot study demonstrated that the gut microbiome of ASD children differed significantly from that of healthy controls and was converted by Juvenil supplementation toward a more neurotypical microbiome that positively modulated children's autism symptoms.","Hrnciarova Jela, Kubelkova Klara, Bostik Vanda, Rychlik Ivan, Karasova Daniela, Babak Vladimir, Datkova Magdalena, Simackova

"39056514","10.1002/Jclp.23735","Applications and efficacy of radically open dialectical behavior therapy (RO DBT): A systematic review of the literature.","2024-11-01","Radically open dialectical behaviour therapy (RO DBT) is a transdiagnostic treatment, originally developed as a variant of dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT), that emerged as a novel treatment approach for those presenting with excessive or maladaptive overcontrol. Despite RO DBT's growing popularity among clinicians as a treatment for chronic depression, personality disorders and eating disorders, to date, no systematic review has been conducted to summarise the evidence on this therapy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to systematically review the literature to provide a current and comprehensive summary of the available evidence on the clinical applications and efficacy of RO DBT. Articles were included if they were original research studies that described the use of RO DBT in the treatment of any psychological disorder, condition or symptom, published in the English language in a peer-reviewed journal. Four electronic databases were searched, and screening, selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction were all conducted by two independent reviewers. Fourteen articles were included in this review, including two qualitative articles, one case study, five case series studies, four quasi-experimental studies, and two articles describing one randomized control trial. Findings indicated there is emerging evidence for the use of RO DBT in both adolescents and adults, for disorders characterized by excessive self-control, such as anorexia nervosa and autism, as well as for treatment-resistant depression. While RO DBT shows promise as a treatment for disorders of overcontrol, further research is needed.

"39056559","10.1111/Jpm.13088","Eye movements desensitization and reprocessing with finger movements and Elite mobile health software on guilt feeling of parents of children with autism: A randomized trial.","2025-02-01","WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Taking care of an autistic child at home can be tough for parents. They struggle to balance caring for their child and other tasks. This can affect their emotional well-being and cause guilt and other psychological problems. WHAT DOES THE PAPER ADD TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing with finger movements can reduce guilt in parents of autistic children. Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing with Elite mobile health software movements can reduce guilt in parents of autistic children. The bilateral eye stimulation method using finger movements has a more sustained impact than the Elite app's bilateral stimulation method. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Healthcare providers are encouraged to learn Eye Movements Desensitization and Reprocessing. Healthcare providers are encouraged to use these methods to help with psychological issues in children with autism. Psychiatric nurses are encouraged to utilize this treatment approach for parents of children with autism, as well as to help alleviate feelings of guilt more broadly. INTRODUCTION: Caring for an autistic child at home can be challenging for parents, as it can make it difficult to balance their responsibilities. This imbalance can negatively affect the emotional well-being of the caregiver and lead to feelings of guilt. While this is a known issue, there may be gaps in knowledge specific to Iran. In this study, a new method was introduced to address this issue. This study aimed to examine the impact of desensitization with eye movements and reprocessing (EMDR) on reducing parental guilt among autistic children's families. We aim to examine the effectiveness of two different treatment methods. This study involved 90 parents (60 mothers, 30 fathers) of autistic children randomly assigned to either an experimental or control group. The two experimental groups received a 45-min intervention session once a week for 3 weeks, while the control group did not receive any intervention. Data on feelings of guilt was collected using a questionnaire. After 30 days, both groups took a follow-up test. The data were analysed using statistical software. This study found that there were significant differences in guilt feelings among different groups of EMDR therapy and a control group. Specifically, no significant differences were observed in the mean guilt scores between the experimental and control groups at the pre-intervention stage (p > .05). However, the experimental groups exhibited significantly lower mean guilt scores immediately after the intervention and 1 month later than the control group (p < .05). Immediately after the intervention and 1 month later, no significant differences were observed between the two experimental groups (p > .05). The findings of this study demonstrate the efficacy of desensitization treatment using eye movements and reprocessing in reducing feelings of guilt among autistic children's parents. In the follow-up phase, it seems that the two-way stimulation method with finger movements is more effective than Elite software in terms of the continuity of the effect. Healthcare providers are encouraged to learn and use these methods to help prevent and treat psychological issues in autistic children.","Rashidi Hadi, Sadeghian Efat, Shamsaei Farshid, Tapak Leili,

"39062003","10.3390/Biomedicines12071430","Safety, Tolerability, and EEG-Based Target Engagement of STP1 (PDE3,4 Inhibitor and NKCC1 Antagonist) in a Randomized Clinical Trial in a Subgroup of Patients with ASD.","2024-06-27","This study aimed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of STP1, a combination of ibudilast and bumetanide, tailored for the treatment of a clinically and biologically defined subgroup of patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), namely ASD Phenotype 1 (ASD-Phen1). We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase 1b study with two 14-day treatment phases (registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT04644003). Nine ASD-Phen1 patients were administered STP1, while three received a placebo. We assessed safety and tolerability, along with electrophysiological markers, such as EEG, Auditory Habituation, and Auditory Chirp Synchronization, to better understand STP1's mechanism of action. Additionally, we used several clinical scales to measure treatment outcomes. The results showed that STP1 was well-tolerated, with electrophysiological markers indicating a significant and dose-related reduction of gamma power in the whole brain and in brain areas associated with executive function and memory. Treatment with STP1 also increased alpha 2 power in frontal and occipital regions and improved habituation and neural synchronization to auditory chirps. Although numerical improvements were observed in several clinical scales, they did not reach statistical significance. Overall, this study suggests that STP1 is well-tolerated in ASD-Phen1 patients and shows indirect target engagement in ASD brain regions of interest.","Erickson Craig A, Perez-Cano Laura, Pedapati

"39066520","10.1080/17483107.2024.2382906","Pivotal response treatment and applied behavior analysis interventions for autism spectrum disorder delivered by human vs robotic agents: a systematic review of literature.","2025-02-01","Robotic technology-aided instruction and interventions have been designed to support both Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) and Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT) interventions for children with ASD. However, to the best of our knowledge, this field has not been systematically reviewed. Thus, we aimed to systematically review the literature to determine whether ABA or PRT methods in a robotic therapeutic context yield better outcomes for individuals with ASD, specifically in terms of approaching and accepting robots. A comprehensive search of electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar was conducted. Randomized control trials (RCT) and pre-post-test design investigations that assessed the impact of ABA vs. PRT approach <i>via</i> robot-mediated technology vs. human trainers on intervention outcomes of children with ASD were selected and included in this systematic review. Finally, 13 papers met the criteria for inclusion in the systematic review. Two independent reviewers extracted the associated data from each selected study according to the standardized data extraction form. Two reviewers also assessed the quality of each study independently using the Cochrane Back Review Scale and JBI tool for quasi-experimental studies. We categorized two general classifications of findings including ABA vs. PRT as well as robotic technology vs. human. In conclusion, the existing investigations on the effect of robotic assistive technology using ABA or PRT approach are promising particularly in therapeutic contexts with a more natural context and social flavor.","Shayestehfar Monir, Nakhostin-Ansari Amin, Jahandideh Pardis, Memari Saeideh, Geoffrey Louie Wing-Yue, Memari Amirhossein","Disability and rehabilitation.

"39153149","10.1007/S10803-024-06477-1","Feasibility and Tolerability of Daily Theta Burst Stimulation in Autistic Youth with Intellectual Disabilities and Minimally Speaking Status: A Pilot Double-Blind Randomized Sham-Controlled Trial.","2024-08-17","Scarce clinical trials involving autistic people with intellectual disability (ID) and minimally speaking (MS) status have been a substantial unmet research need in the field. Although earlier studies have demonstrated the feasibility and beneficial potentials of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in intellectually able autistic people, the feasibility and tolerability of applying rTMS in autistic people with ID/MS has never been studied. We conducted the world-first 4-week randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled pilot trial to investigate the feasibility, tolerability, and safety of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS, a variant of excitatory rTMS) over the left DLPFC in autistic youth with ID/MS. 25 autistic youth with ID/MS (aged 8-30 years) were randomized to a 20-session 4-week daily iTBS (n = 13) vs. sham stimulation (n = 12) with follow-up 4 and 8 weeks, respectively, after the last stimulation. A retention rate was 100% in our study. Adverse events of local pain (38%) and dizziness (8%) were only noted in the active group. All adverse events were mild and transient. There were no seizures, new behavioral problems, or other severe/serious adverse events noted. No participants dropped out due to adverse events. With a small sample size, we did not find any beneficial signal of DLPFC iTBS. Our pilot data suggest regular daily TBS treatment for four weeks is feasible, well tolerated and safe in autistic youth with ID/MS. Future randomized controlled trials with sufficiently powered samples are needed to investigate the beneficial potential of rTMS/TBS for autistic people with ID/MS.","Ni Hsing-Chang, Chen Yi-Lung, Lin

Propranolol, a beta-blocker, has accumulated much anecdotal evidence as a promising option. However, well-designed studies are rare, and the apprehension about cardiovascular side effects from large doses continues to exist. The aims of this study were (1) to demonstrate the feasibility of treating aggression with high-dose propranolol using telehealth study visits and (2) to document cardiac safety. This study utilized a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Dosing was titrated up in a flexible but stepwise fashion until therapeutic response was obtained or up to 200 mg tid. Following washout, those who were assigned propranolol were crossed over to placebo and vice versa. Six participants between the ages 12-19 participated. The primary outcome measures were the final Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale (CGI-I) and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Irritability (ABC-C/I) scores at 200 mg tid. The CGI-I indicated a 50% reduction in symptoms in the propranolol phase, while the ABC-I indicated a 37% reduction in comparison to placebo. The effect sizes ( r ) for the CGI-I and the ABC-C/I were large, -0.74 and -0.64, respectively. The average blood pressure was 122/68 during the placebo phase and 109/72 during the propranolol phase. All Holter monitor exams were unremarkable. These results suggest that propranolol is an effective option in decreasing aggression in individuals with ASD. As this was a small study, a larger clinical trial is needed.","London Eric B, Zimmerman-Bier Barbie L, Yoo J Helen, Gaffney Joseph W","Journal of clinical psychopharmacology","Humans, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Propranolol, Aggression, Male, Adolescent, Child, Adrenergic beta-Antagonists, Pilot Projects, Young Adult, Female, Treatment Outcome, Adult","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39174017","From the New York State Institute for Basic Research, Department of Psychology, Staten Island, NY.; Rutgers University Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and the Children's Health Institute, New Brunswick, NJ.",

This study examined the effect of telehealth delivery of a parent-mediated NDBI, Project ImPACT, on children's expressive language ability using a randomized control trial with intent-to-treat analysis. Sixty-four young autistic children and their primary caregiver were matched on age and developmental quotient and randomly assigned to receive 6 months of therapist-assisted Project ImPACT (i.e., telehealth coaching), self-directed Project ImPACT, or an active control. Parent-child interactions were recorded at intake and immediately post-treatment, and the children's expressive language skills were assessed at intake and a 9-month follow-up using standardized measures. Although there was no total effect of treatment group assignment on child outcomes, a serial mediation analysis revealed that therapist-assisted ImPACT had an indirect effect on children's expressive language ability at follow-up through their parents' use of the intervention strategies and their intentional communication immediately post-treatment. Findings support Project ImPACT's program theory and highlight the importance of coaching in achieving positive outcomes when delivered via telehealth.","Ingersoll Brooke, Frost Kyle M, Straiton

"39248107","10.1002/Aur.3222","Neurophysiological effects of a combined treatment of lovastatin and minocycline in patients with fragile X syndrome: Ancillary results of the LOVAMIX randomized clinical trial.","2024-09-01","Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the primary hereditary cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. It is characterized by exacerbated neuronal excitability, and its correction is considered an objective measure of treatment response in animal models, a marker albeit rarely used in clinical trials. Here, we used an extensive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) battery to assess the neurophysiological effects of a therapy combining two disease-modifying drugs, lovastatin (40 mg) and minocycline (100 mg), administered alone for 8 weeks and in combination for 12 weeks, in 19 patients (mean age of 23.58 ± 1.51) with FXS taking part in the LOVAmix trial. The TMS battery, which included the resting motor threshold, short-interval intracortical inhibition, long-interval intracortical inhibition, corticospinal silent period, and intracortical facilitation, was completed at baseline after 8 weeks of monotherapy (visit 2 of the clinical trial) and after 12 weeks of dual therapy (visit 4 of the clinical trial). Repeated measure ANOVAs were performed between baseline and visit 2 (monotherapy) and visit 3 (dual therapy) with interactions for which monotherapy the participants received when they began the clinical trial. Results showed that dual therapy was associated with reduced cortical excitability after 20 weeks. This was reflected by a significant increase in the resting-motor threshold after dual therapy compared to baseline. There was a tendency for enhanced short-intracortical inhibition, a marker of GABAa-mediated inhibition after 8 weeks of monotherapy compared to baseline. Together, these results suggest that a combined therapy of minocycline and lovastatin might act on the core neurophysiopathology of FXS. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02680379).","Morin-Parent Florence, Champigny Camille, Côté Samantha, Mohamad Teddy, Hasani Seyede Anis, Çaku Artuela, Corbin François, Lepage

"39306958","10.1016/J.Sleep.2024.09.001","A pilot randomised controlled trial of a telehealth-delivered brief 'Sleeping Sound Autism' intervention for autistic children.","2024-12-01","Access to behavioural sleep intervention is beneficial for autistic children, yet many families face barriers to access associated with location and time. Preliminary evidence supports telehealth-delivered sleep intervention. However, no studies have evaluated brief telehealth sleep intervention. To address this, we evaluated telehealth delivery of the brief behavioural Sleeping Sound Autism intervention, using a two-armed, parallel-group, non-blinded, pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) design (trial registration: ANZCTR12620001276943). Sixty-one families of autistic children without intellectual disability (5-12 years, 46% female) with caregiver-reported moderate-severe behavioural sleep problems participated Australia-wide, randomised to an intervention (n = 30) or treatment as usual control group (n = 31). Intervention group participants were invited to attend two video-conference telehealth sessions and one follow-up phone call with a trained clinician. Survey data was collected from caregivers at baseline and three- and six-months post-randomisation, to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy. Ten intervention group caregivers participated in end-of-study semi-structured interviews to explore their experiences. Forty-nine caregivers completed surveys. At baseline, 87% felt positive and 84% felt confident about participating via telehealth, and 75% believed the program would improve child sleep. At three-months, intervention group caregivers (n = 24) reported the usefulness (100%) of and preference for (71%) telehealth, and 95.8% would recommend this sleep program to other families. A significant group by time difference was observed in child sleep (Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire) with large effect sizes (d = 0.87-1.05), emotion and behaviour (Developmental Behavior Checklist 2) with moderate effect sizes (d = 0.40-0.57), and caregiver mental health (Kessler 10) with small to moderate effect sizes (d = 0.60-0.28), favouring the intervention group (n = 23). There were no significant group differences in child (Child Health Utility instrument) or caregiver (Assessment of Quality of Life) quality of life. However, there were individual differences in the clinical significance of improved child sleep. Qualitative data showed that whilst telehealth was convenient for caregivers, without attenuating the benefits of most key intervention features, not all children were able to engage effectively with the clinician via telehealth. This first pilot RCT of a brief telehealth behavioural sleep intervention for primary-school-aged autistic children suggests that telehealth delivery is acceptable, feasible and likely efficacious in improving sleep in the short-term.

"39342272","10.1186/S40359-024-02020-0","Study Protocol for a Cluster, Randomized, Controlled Community Effectiveness Trial of the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) Compared to Community Early Behavioral Intervention (EBI) in Community Programs serving Young Autistic Children: Partnering for Autism: Learning more to improve Services (PALMS).","2024-09-28","The rising number of children identified with autism has led to exponential growth in for-profit applied behavior analysis (ABA) agencies and the use of highly structured approaches that may not be developmentally appropriate for young children. Multiple clinical trials support naturalistic developmental behavior interventions (NDBIs) that integrate ABA and developmental science and are considered best practices for young autistic children. The Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) is a comprehensive NDBI shown to improve social communication outcomes for young autistic children in several controlled efficacy studies. However, effectiveness data regarding NDBI use in community-based agencies are limited. This study uses a community-partnered approach to test the effectiveness of ESDM compared to usual early behavioral intervention (EBI) for improving social communication and language in autistic children served by community agencies. This is a hybrid type 1 cluster-randomized controlled trial with 2 conditions: ESDM and EBI. In the intervention group, supervising providers will receive training in ESDM; in the control group, they will continue EBI as usual. We will enroll and randomize 100 supervisors (50 ESDM, 50 EBI) by region. Each supervisor enrolls 3 families of autistic children under age 5 (n = 300) and accompanying behavior technicians (n = 200). The primary outcome is child language and social communication at 6 and 12 months. Secondary outcomes include child adaptive behavior, caregiver use of ESDM strategies, and provider intervention fidelity. Child social motivation and caregiver fidelity will be tested as mediating variables. ESDM implementation determinants will be explored using mixed methods. This study will contribute novel knowledge on ESDM effectiveness, the variables that mediate and moderate child outcomes, and engagement of its mechanisms in community use. We expect results from this trial to increase community availability of this model and access to high-quality intervention for young autistic children, especially those who depend on publicly funded intervention services. Understanding implementation determinants will aid scale-up of effective models within communities. Clinicaltrials.gov identifier number NCT06005285. Registered on August 21, 2023.

"39357740","10.1016/J.Cct.2024.107704","Protocol of a randomized controlled trial into guided internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia in autistic adults (i-Sleep Autism).","2024-11-01","Sleep problems, especially insomnia, are prevalent among autistic adults, affecting about 60 %, and significantly impact their quality of life. Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (iCBT-I) could provide accessible and scalable treatment. Given the unique sensory- and information processing, and social challenges at play in autism, a tailored treatment approach may be essential to tackle sleep problems. Yet, interventions developed and tested specifically for autistic adults were scarce. Addressing this gap is crucial to meet the urgent need for effective insomnia treatments in this population. With this two-arm, parallel, superiority randomized controlled trial, we will assess the effectiveness of a guided iCBT-I intervention for adults (N = 160) with autism and insomnia (i-Sleep Autism). In co-creation, i-Sleep Autism has been adjusted from an existing intervention (i-Sleep). Inclusion criteria are: age ≥ 18, an ASD diagnosis, and at least sub-threshold insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index ≥10). Participants are randomly assigned to either i-Sleep Autism or an information only waitlist control condition (online psychoeducation and sleep hygiene). After 6 weeks, the control group receives the intervention. Insomnia severity is the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include pre-sleep arousal, general mental health, depression, anxiety, daily functioning, and quality of life. Assessments will occur at baseline, mid-intervention (3 weeks), post-intervention (6 weeks), and at 6-month follow-up (the intervention group). Linear mixed-effect regression models are employed to evaluate the effectiveness of i-Sleep Autism, alongside exploration of potential moderators and mediators. This trial can reveal whether autistic adults with insomnia benefit from a guided e-health intervention.

"39368459","10.1016/J.Brat.2024.104639","Internet-based, parent-led cognitive behavioral therapy for autistic youth with anxiety-related disorders: A randomized trial comparing email vs. telehealth support.","2024-12-01","This study tested two versions of parent-led, Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety among autistic youth; one that provided weekly email support (iCBT-Email), and one that provided alternating bi-weekly emails and video calls (iCBT-Video) across 12 weeks. It was expected that those in the iCBT-Video condition would complete more treatment content, which in turn would lead to more anxiety improvement. Fifty-seven autistic youth (7-15 years-old) with anxiety disorders were randomized to iCBT-Email or iCBT-Video. There were no significant differences in improvement in clinician-rated, child-reported, or parent-reported anxiety severity or functional impairment. Posttreatment response rates were 55% in iCBT-Email and 67% in iCBT-Video. Module completion predicted improved treatment outcome, though there was no difference in module completion across groups. Therapists spent an average of 16.29 min/family/week (SD = 7.11) in the iCBT-Email condition and 24.13 min/family/week (SD = 6.84) in the iCBT-Video condition. Email and telehealth-supported, parent-led iCBT both appear to be effective treatments for autistic youth with anxiety disorders that require reduced therapist effort. Future research should seek novel methods to enhance engagement with iCBT content.

"39375937","10.1002/Aur.3240","Comparative effectiveness trial: Modular behavior approach for young autistic children compared to comprehensive behavioral intervention.","2024-11-01","This 24-week single-blind trial tested a modular approach for young autistic children (MAYAC) that was delivered for fewer hours per week and modified based on child progress and parental input compared to comprehensive behavioral intervention treatment as usual (CBI, TAU). Participants were autistic children, ages 18-60 months of age. MAYAC was initially 5 h of intervention per week, one of which was parent training and the other four direct therapy focusing on social communication and engagement, but additional modules could be added for up to 10 h per week. Comprehensive behavior intervention was delivered for ≥15 h per week. Outcome measures included the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales; VABS, the Ohio Autism Clinical Improvement Scale - Autism Severity; OACIS - AS and the Pervasive Developmental Disorder Behavior Inventory - Parent; PDDBI-P. Implementation and parent satisfaction measures were also collected. Fifty-six children, mean age of 34 months, were randomized. Within-group analysis revealed significant improvements from baseline to week 24 for both MAYAC (p < 0.0001) and CBI, TAU (p < 0.0001) on the VABS. The noninferiority test was performed to test between group differences and MAYAC was not inferior to CBI, TAU on the VABS (p = 0.0144). On the OACIS - AS, 48.0% of MAYAC and 45.5% of CBI were treatment responders there were no significant changes on the PDDBI-P, for either group. Treatment fidelity was high for both groups (>95%) as was parent satisfaction. Findings from this small trial are promising and suggest MAYAC may be an alternative for some young autistic children and their families to CBI, TAU.","Anderson Cynthia, Hochheimer Samantha, Warren

"39378470",,"Psychoeducational and Behavioral Interventions in Autism Spectrum Disorder: is the ABA Method Really the Most Effective?","2024-09-01","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in communication, social interactions, and repetitive behaviors. Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is a prominent intervention aimed at modifying problem behaviors in individuals with ASD. ABA focuses on analyzing environmental contingencies and using operant conditioning to promote functional behaviors. Despite its widespread use, the effectiveness of ABA remains debated, with mixed scientific evidence. Some studies highlight its benefits, while others point out biases and limitations. Further research, including randomized controlled trials, is needed to determine the most effective interventions for ASD, considering the diverse needs of individuals and the potential biases in

However, no intrastimulation social cognition training for ASD has been developed so far. The objective of this two-armed, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial is to investigate the effects of tDCS combined with a newly developed intrastimulation social cognition training on adolescents with ASD. Twenty-two male adolescents with ASD were randomly assigned to receive 10 sessions of either anodal or sham tDCS at F3/right supraorbital region together with online intrastimulation training comprising basic and complex emotion recognition tasks. Using baseline magnetic resonance imaging data, individual electric field distributions were simulated, and brain activation patterns of the training tasks were analyzed. Additionally, questionnaires were administered at baseline and following the intervention. Compared to sham tDCS, anodal tDCS significantly improved dynamic emotion recognition over the course of the sessions. This task also showed the highest activations in face processing regions. Moreover, the improvement was associated with electric field density at the medial prefrontal cortex and social awareness in exploratory analyses. Both groups showed high tolerability and acceptability of tDCS, and significant improvement in overall ASD symptoms. Taken together, multisession tDCS improved dynamic emotion recognition in adolescents with ASD using a task that activates brain regions associated with the social brain network. The variability in the electric field might diminish tDCS effects and future studies should investigate individualized approaches.","Prillinger Karin, Amador de Lara Gabriel, Klöbl Manfred, Lanzenberger Rupert, Plener Paul L, Poustka Luise, Konicar Lilian, Radev Stefan T","Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics","Humans, Male, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation, Adolescent, Double-Blind Method, Emotions, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Recognition, Psychology, Child, Social Cognition","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39393982","Comprehensive Center for Clinical Neuroscience and Mental Health (C3NMH), Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria; Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria; Comprehensive Center for Pediatrics (CCP), Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria; Comprehensive Center for Clinical Neuroscience and Mental Health (C3NMH), Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Ulm, 89073 Ulm, Germany.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, University Hospital Heidelberg, 69115 Heidelberg, Germany.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria; Comprehensive Center for Pediatrics (CCP), Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria; Comprehensive Center for Clinical Neuroscience and Mental Health (C3NMH), Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Cognitive Science Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 12180 Troy, New York, USA; Center for Modeling, Simulation and Imaging in Medicine (CEMSIM), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 12180 Troy, New York, USA.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria; Comprehensive Center for Pediatrics (CCP), Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria; Comprehensive Center for Clinical Neuroscience and Mental Health (C3NMH), Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.

Applied behaviour analysis (ABA) and music therapy are recognised interventions for improving ASD symptoms. However, the specific benefits of parent-child music therapy and ABA for autistic children and their mothers remain uncertain. This study evaluated the effects of parent-child music therapy on preschool autistic children and their mothers. A randomised controlled trial was conducted with 100 mother-child pairs assigned to either the control group receiving ABA or the intervention group receiving both music therapy and ABA. Qualitative interviews were conducted post-intervention for 12 mothers. Children in the intervention group exhibited lower scores for ASD symptoms than those in the control group. Moreover, mothers in the intervention group demonstrated reduced dysfunctional parent-child interaction, lower overall parental stress, significantly improved family functioning, and increased levels of hope compared with those in the control group. Mothers held positive views regarding music therapy. Combining ABA with parent-child music therapy can alleviate ASD symptoms in children and reduce stress in mothers. Improved parent-child interaction and enhanced family functioning further support the benefits of this combined approach. Parent-child music therapy, combined with ABA demonstrated positive outcomes for autistic children, including reduced ASD symptoms, improved parent-child interaction, decreased parental stress, enhanced family functioning, and increased hope. These findings highlight the potential of incorporating music therapy as a valuable component in the comprehensive treatment of ASD.

Psychometric investigations have shown a multifactorial structure and some items have limited utility assessing symptom severity in children. To address these issues, we developed and evaluated optimized 10- and 20-item PANSS short-forms (PANSS10 and PANSS20) using patient-level clinical trial data. This study further assesses these optimized forms using independent clinical trial data. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> We examined patient-level data from a randomized pediatric schizophrenia trial comparing paliperidone ER to aripiprazole. Data were accessed through the Yale Open Data Access (YODA) secure platform. Analyses included confirmatory factor analyses, graded response models, ω score reliability, internal consistency, sensitivity to change, and criterion validity versus the Clinical Global Impressions of Severity (CGI-S). Bland-Altman analyses examined score calibration versus the 30-item PANSS and inclusion cut scores. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Participants (<i>N</i> = 288) were ages 12 to 17 years (<i>M</i> = 15.3, SD = 1.46; 66% male). Total scores for the PANSS10 and PANSS20 showed strong correlations with the 30-item PANSS (0.90 and 0.97, respectively). Average inter-item correlations were 0.10 and 0.14 and ω<sup>Total</sup> reliabilities were 0.74 and 0.85. Both PANSS10 and PANSS20 scores showed reliability >0.80-2.3 to 4.5 SD and -3.0 to 6.0 SD about mean symptom severity, respectively. Sensitivity to treatment was also similar (partial <i>eta</i> squared 0.23 and 0.22), as was correlation with CGI-S at baseline (0.45 and 0.48; not significantly different). The mean item-average discrepancy with the 30-item PANSS was 0.095 for PANSS10 and 0.033 for PANSS20. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> The optimized PANSS forms continue to show impressive reliability, validity, and calibration compared with the 30-item PANSS. Researchers should consider replacing the 30-item PANSS with the PANSS10 as a clinical outcome and screening measure due to its length and psychometric performance.","Langfus Joshua A, Youngstrom Eric A, Daniel David, Busner Joan, Findling Robert L","Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology","Humans, Child, Male, Reproducibility of Results, Adolescent, Female, Aripiprazole, Psychometrics, Antipsychotic Agents, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Schizophrenia, Paliperidone Palmitate, Severity of Illness Index","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39419042","Signant Health, Wayne, Pennsylvania, USA.; Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.",

A prospective study was conducted to select 86 children with HFA admitted to the hospital from February 2022 to February 2024. They were divided into two groups according to the random number table method, with 43 cases in each group. In this double-blind study, the control group was given LSP intervention training, and the observation group was given NFB intervention on the basis of the treatment used in the control group. Both groups were treated for 6 months. The scores of Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC), Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC), Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), and Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) were compared between the two groups before intervention and at 6 months after intervention. The relationship of PedsQL score with ABC, ATEC, and SRS scores was analyzed in children with HFA. After 6 months of intervention, the scores of ABC, ATEC, and SRS in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group, while the PedsQL score in the observation group was significantly higher than that in the control group (<i>P</i><0.05). The PedsQL score was negatively correlated with the ABC, ATEC, and SRS scores in children with HFA (<i>r</i>=-0.238, -0.381, -0.219 respectively; <i>P</i><0.001). NFB combined with LSP can effectively improve the clinical symptoms and social ability, control the development of the disease, and improve the quality of life in children with HFA.","Huang Ming-Xin,

"39510775","10.1136/Bmjopen-2023-081827","Feasibility and cross-cultural validation of an adapted social skills group training programme (KONTAKT<sup>TM</sup> CHILD) for Chinese autistic children: a waitlist RCT protocol.","2024-11-07","School-age autistic children commonly experience social communication and interaction challenges in their everyday lives. While international evidence suggests that social skills group training (SSGT) programmes can support autistic children, improving their psychosocial functioning, to date there is no standardised evidence-based SSGT tailored towards the needs of autistic children aged 8-12 years living in the Chinese Mainland. Therefore, the primary objective of this study will be to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a culturally adapted 16-session version of the social skills programme KONTAKT in Chinese autistic children. Additionally, preliminary efficacy and cost-effectiveness will be assessed to inform a future definitive trial. This study will employ a randomised, single-blinded, waitlist-controlled feasibility design with 36 Chinese autistic children aged 8-12 years with IQ over 70 referred to the Child Development and Behavior Center in Guangzhou, China. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the immediate training group or the delayed training group stratified by sex. Feasibility will be assessed using quantitative and qualitative data obtained from the KONTAKT CHILD participants, their parents and facilitators of the programme. Preliminary efficacy and cost-effectiveness are assessed via quantitative data obtained at five time points. The primary efficacy outcome is participants' improvement in social skills as measured by the Contextual Assessment of Social Skills. Other outcomes include parents and teachers' reports of participants' autistic traits and adaptive functioning, participants' self-report and projective tests for self-assertiveness and psychosocial functioning, and parent reports on parental reflective functioning and perceived school support. Common process factors and their effects on outcomes will also be explored. Cost-effectiveness will consider from both societal and healthcare perspectives. The current study protocol has been reviewed and ethics approval has been obtained from the Ethical Board Committee at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (II2023-119-01). The trial was pre-registered in Chinese Clinical Trials (ChiCTR2300072136) on 5 June 2023. The results of this trial will be actively disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. Any identifiable personal information will be anonymised to protect confidentiality. 2.0, 31 July 2024.

This brief report describes effects of AAI on acute HPA axis reactivity and regulation. Saliva was collected before, during, and after psychosocial intervention sessions with and without therapy dogs and later assayed for cortisol (ug/dL). Thirty-nine participants (n = 39) with ADHD, aged 7-9 years (79% male) provided saliva at 3 points during 90-minute sessions; (<i>i</i>) upon arrival, (<i>ii</i>) +20 minutes, and (<i>iii</i>) 15 minutes prior to departure, on 3 occasions across an 8-week intervention (weeks 1, 4, and 8). Cortisol slopes calculated within each session were compared across the intervention weeks to determine within subject and between group effect sizes. Spearman's correlations between baseline individual neurodevelopmental symptoms and in-session acute cortisol responses were also evaluated. No significant between group differences were observed in cortisol responsiveness at week-1. By week-4, in-session changes in cortisol were evident, with significantly greater decreases in the AAI group (Cohen's <i>d</i> = -.40). This pattern was also observed at week-8, with an even stronger effect-size (<i>d</i> = -0.60). Concurrent symptoms of autism were associated with the in-session acute cortisol response. Specifically, higher parent-reported symptom scores were associated with steeper decreases in cortisol across the session at week 1 (<i>r</i> = -0.42, <i>p <</i>.01) and week-8 (<i>r</i> = -0.34 <i>p</i> = .05). At week-8 this association was stronger in the AAI group (<i>r</i> = -0.53) versus TAU (<i>r</i> = -0.25), with Cohen's <i>q</i> = 0.413). AAI may influence acute HPA reactivity and regulation for children with ADHD. Concurrent symptoms of ADHD and autism may be related to individual differences in the nature of the effect. Implications of these findings for AAI as an alternative, or complementary intervention for ADHD are discussed.

"39565505","10.1007/S11596-024-2938-3","Wearable EEG Neurofeedback Based-on Machine Learning Algorithms for Children with Autism: A Randomized, Placebo-controlled Study.","2024-12-01","Behavioral interventions have been shown to ameliorate the electroencephalogram (EEG) dynamics underlying the behavioral symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), while studies have also demonstrated that mirror neuron mu rhythm-based EEG neurofeedback training improves the behavioral functioning of individuals with ASD. This study aimed to test the effects of a wearable mu rhythm neurofeedback training system based on machine learning algorithms for children with autism. A randomized, placebo-controlled study was carried out on 60 participants aged 3 to 6 years who were diagnosed with autism, at two center-based intervention sites. The neurofeedback group received active mu rhythm neurofeedback training, while the control group received a sham neurofeedback training. Other behavioral intervention programs were similar between the two groups. After 60 sessions of treatment, both groups showed significant improvements in several domains including language, social and problem behavior. The neurofeedback group showed significantly greater improvements in expressive language (P=0.013) and cognitive awareness (including joint attention, P=0.003) than did the placebo-controlled group. Artificial intelligence-powered wearable EEG neurofeedback, as a type of brain-computer interface application, is a promising assistive technology that can provide targeted intervention for the core brain mechanisms underlying ASD symptoms.","Wang Xian-Na, Zhang Tong, Han Bi-Cheng, Luo Wei-Wei, Liu Wen-Hui, Yang Zhao-Yi, Disi A, Sun Yue, Yang Jin-Chen","Current medical science","Humans, Neurofeedback, Child, Male, Female, Electroencephalography, Child, Preschool, Machine Learning, Wearable Electronic Devices, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Algorithms","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39565505","Qiangnao Keji (BrainCo) Ltd., Hangzhou, 310027, China. jinchen.yang@brainco.tech.; Capital Medical University School of Rehabilitation Medicine, Beijing, 100068, China.

"39591434","10.1371/Journal.Pone.0305013","Assessing plasticity in the primary sensory cortex and its relation with atypical tactile reactivity in autism: A TMS-EEG protocol.","2024-01-01","Atypical sensory reactivity is a cardinal presentation in autism. Within the tactile domain, atypical tactile reactivity (TR) is common, it emerges early, persists into adulthood, and impedes social interaction and daily functioning. Hence, atypical TR is a key target for biological intervention to improve outcomes. Brain mechanisms informing biological interventions for atypical TR remains elusive. We previously reported hyper-plasticity in the motor cortex in autistic adults and found that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), designed to strengthen inhibitory processes in the brain, reduced hyper-plasticity. Whether the primary sensory cortex (S1) is characterized by hyper-plasticity, which may underlie atypical TR in autism is unknown. We aim to test whether hyper-plasticity in the S1 underlies atypical TR in autism, and investigate if a single session of rTMS can safely reduce hyper-plasticity in S1 in autistic adults. Plasticity will be assessed in the left S1 with integrated paired associative stimulation and electroencephalography (PAS-EEG) paradigm in 32 autistic adults and 32 age-, sex-, and intelligence quotient-matched controls. Autistic participants will be further randomized (double-blind, 1:1) to receive a single-session of either sham or active 20 Hz bilateral rTMS over the S1 and the plasticity will be re-assessed over the left S1 on the same day. Atypical TR has been identified as one of the top clinical research priorities that can influence outcome in autistic population. The study findings can be highly valuable to further elucidate the mechanism underlying atypical TR, which in turn can help with developing a mechanism-driven intervention.","Kariminezhad Shohreh,

"39608635","10.1016/J.Jaac.2024.10.015","Umbrella Review and Meta-Analysis: The Efficacy of Nonpharmacological Interventions for Sleep Disturbances in Children and Adolescents.","2025-03-01","We conducted an umbrella review of systematic reviews (SRs), with or without meta-analysis (MA), of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing nonpharmacological sleep interventions for children and adolescents across various clinical populations. We searched multiple electronic databases up to January 24, 2024. Meta-analyzable data from RCTs in the retrieved SRs/MAs were pooled using Metaumbrella. Primary outcomes were subjective/objective child sleep parameters. Additional outcomes included child health/functioning and parental sleep/health. The quality of the MAs/SRs was assessed with Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR-2), and the certainty of evidence using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE). We included 93 SRs/MAs covering 393 RCTs, with 25 (17%, 39%, and 30%: high, moderate, and low quality) providing data for quantitative synthesis. Behavioral interventions, usually multicomponent including parent training, psychoeducation, and/or specific sleep therapy/strategies, showed beneficial effects on night waking, sleep duration, overall sleep disturbance, mood/depression, and maternal sleep quality (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.10-0.80) in participants with sleep problems without a formal sleep disorder diagnosis. For those with a formal diagnosis (mainly insomnia), benefits were found for night waking, sleep efficiency (subjective/actigraphically measured), and sleep onset latency (mean SMD = 0.49-0.97). Those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) improved in bedtime resistance, night waking, parasomnias, sleep anxiety, ADHD symptoms, sleep disturbance, and quality of life (mean SMD = 0.18-0.49). For those with autism, sleep disturbance improved (mean SMD = 0.70). However, all findings were of low to very low certainty of evidence. Among nonpharmacological interventions for sleep difficulties in youth, only behavioral interventions are supported by meta-analytic evidence, yet with small-to-moderate effect sizes and limited certainty of evidence. This ""umbrella review"" (a review of reviews) analyzed 93 systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials examining nonmedication sleep interventions for children and adolescents. The authors found that behavioral interventions, including parent training and psychoeducation, had positive effects on sleep issues like night waking, with effect sizes ranging from small to moderate. Improvements were also seen in children with ADHD and autism. However, the quality of the evidence for these benefits was rated as low to very low. This suggests that while behavioral approaches may help, more robust evidence is needed to confirm their benefits.

However, there is a lack of clinical research on the impact of metformin on irritability associated with autism. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of metformin as an adjuvant therapy with risperidone for managing irritability in children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This is a randomized, 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at the children's autism clinic of Roozbeh Hospital (Tehran, Iran) from March 2024 to May 2024. Participants were divided into two groups of risperidone plus metformin (500 mg per day) and risperidone plus placebo and were assessed at baseline, weeks 5 and 10 with the aberrant behavior checklist-community scale (ABC-C). A total of 55 patients were included in the final analysis. Irritability (primary outcome measure) sharply decreased in the metformin compared to the placebo group (<i>p</i> = 0.008). Among the other four subscales of ABC-C, the hyperactivity/noncompliance score showed a significant drop during the baseline-to-week-5 period (<i>p</i> = 0.021). In addition, inappropriate speech subscales decreased significantly from baseline-to-week 5 in the metformin compared to the placebo group (<i>p</i> = 0.045). No other significant finding was observed among ABC-C scores for lethargy/social withdrawal or stereotypic behavior subscales. Metformin demonstrated promising results in reducing irritability in ASD patients, which is in concordance with previous studies. However, further studies are required before any broad clinical recommendation.","Bazrafshan Zahra, Mohammadi Parsa, Hasanzadeh Alireza, Sanjari Moghaddam Mohammad, Kabiri Maryam, Sanjari Moghaddam Hossein, Abdolghaffari Amir Hossein, Mohammadi Mohammad-Reza, Akhondzadeh Shahin","Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)","Humans, Metformin, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Double-Blind Method, Irritable Mood, Male, Female, Risperidone, Child, Child, Preschool, Drug Therapy, Combination, Antipsychotic Agents, Iran, Treatment Outcome, Hypoglycemic Agents","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39676223","Psychiatric Research Center, Roozbeh Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Toxicology and Pharmacology, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.; Arnold and Marie Schwartz College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Long Island University, New York, NY, USA.",
"39703999","10.1111/Jcpp.14091","Annual Research Review: Micronutrients and their role in the treatment of paediatric mental illness.","2025-04-01","The aim of this narrative review is to summarize evidence relating the importance of nutrient intake from diet and supplementation for paediatric mental health. We begin by reviewing several mechanisms by which nutrients maximize brain health, including enabling metabolic reactions to occur, supporting mitochondrial function, reducing inflammation and assisting with detoxification. Circumstances that may contribute to an individual requiring additional nutrients beyond what are available in the diet, such as consumption of nutritionally depleted food, individual differences in biological need, long-term medication use and gut-brain health needs are then reviewed. These factors underpin the importance of tackling deficiencies relative to individual metabolic requirements with a broad spectrum of micronutrients, as opposed to a single nutrient approach, to address personal metabolic needs and/or environmentally induced nutrient depletions. The evidence for treating psychological symptoms with supplementary micronutrients is presented, summarizing research using broad-spectrum micronutrients in the treatment of mental health issues including aggression, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and emotional dysregulation, often with medium between-group effect sizes compared with placebo, with clinically meaningful changes. The breadth and consistency of the findings highlight the importance of receiving a complete foundation of nutrients to optimize brain health; however, the small number of studies identifies the importance of future work to replicate these preliminary findings. Documented safety in 8-week randomized controlled trials with open-label extensions up to 16 weeks and longer-term follow-up for 1.5-5 years in smaller samples provide reassurance that this treatment approach does not result in serious adverse events. We provide recommendations for future research including consistency in micronutrient interventions, scalable delivery models, effectiveness and implementation studies and the need to investigate these interventions in the prevention and management of less-studied childhood psychiatric conditions.","Rucklidge Julia J, Bruton Alisha, Welsh Alanna, Ast Hayleigh, Johnstone Jeanette M","Journal of

"39709442","10.1186/S13229-024-00635-Z","Impact of chronic intranasal oxytocin administration on face expression processing in autistic children: a randomized controlled trial using fMRI.","2024-12-21","Difficulties with (non-verbal) social communication, including facial expression processing, constitute a hallmark of autism. Intranasal administration of oxytocin has been considered a potential therapeutic option for improving social difficulties in autism, either by enhancing the salience of social cues or by reducing the social stress and anxiety experienced in social encounters. We recorded fMRI brain activity while presenting neutral, fearful and scrambled faces, to compare the neural face processing signature of autistic children (n = 58) with that of matched non-autistic controls (n = 38). Next, in the autistic children group, we implemented this fMRI face processing task in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose oxytocin clinical trial, to evaluate the impact of four-week repeated oxytocin administration (24 IU daily dose) on brain activity in face processing regions. No significant diagnostic-group differences were identified between autistic versus non-autistic children with regard to neural face processing. Furthermore, no significant treatment effects were found in the oxytocin clinical trial. However, exploratory analyses (uncorrected for multiple comparisons) demonstrated decreases in brain activity in the left superior temporal sulcus (STS) and inferior frontal region in the oxytocin compared to the placebo group, and change-from-baseline analyses in the oxytocin group revealed significantly reduced neural activity in the core face-processing network (STS, inferior occipital, and posterior fusiform), as well as in amygdala and inferior frontal region. These findings suggest an attenuating effect of multiple-dose oxytocin administration on neural face processing, potentially supporting the anxiolytic account of oxytocin.","Moerkerke Matthijs, Daniels Nicky, Van der Donck Stephanie, Tang Tiffany, Prinsen Jellina, Yargholi Elahe', Steyaert Jean, Alaerts Kaat, Boets Bart","Molecular autism","Humans, Oxytocin, Administration, Intranasal, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Autistic Disorder, Child, Female, Facial Expression, Double-Blind Method, Brain, Facial Recognition, Adolescent","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39709442","Department of Brain and Cognition, Faculty of Psychology & Educational Sciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.; Department of Neurosciences, Center for Developmental Psychiatry, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.; Department of Neurosciences, Center for Developmental Psychiatry, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium. matthijs.moerkerke@kuleuven.be.; Leuven Autism Research (LAuRes), KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.",

This study aimed to evaluate pentoxifylline as a therapeutic agent for improving negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Chronic schizophrenia outpatients experiencing significant negative symptoms were randomly allocated to receive pentoxifylline 400 mg or matched placebo every 12 hours for 8 weeks. All patients were clinically stable as they had received risperidone for at least 2 months, which was continued. The participants were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale, and side effect checklist. The patients' baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups. There was a significant time-treatment interaction effect on PANSS negative subscale scores (ηP2=0.075), with the pentoxifylline group showing significantly greater reductions until weeks 4 (Cohen d = 0.512) and 8 (Cohen d = 0.622). Also, this group showed a significantly better response by week 8. Other PANSS scores, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores, Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale scores, and side effect frequencies were comparable between the groups. Pentoxifylline showed a nonsignificant higher remission of 37.1% compared with 14.7% in the placebo group. Pentoxifylline was safely and tolerably beneficial for the primary negative symptoms of chronic schizophrenia.","Shamabadi Ahmad, Rafiei-Tabatabaei Elham-Sadat, Kazemzadeh Kimia, Farahmand Kimia, Fallahpour Bita, Khodaei Ardakani Mohammad-Reza, Akhondzadeh Shahin","The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology","Humans, Pentoxifylline, Schizophrenia, Double-Blind Method, Male, Female, Risperidone, Adult, Antipsychotic Agents, Drug Therapy, Combination, Middle Aged, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult, Schizophrenic Psychology","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39716387","Department of Psychiatry, Razi Hospital, University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Psychiatric Research Center, Roozbeh Psychiatric Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.",
"39729835","10.1016/J.Clinsp.2024.100566","Behavioral therapies for the treatment of autism spectrum disorder: A systematic review.","2025-01-01","Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopment spectrum characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interpersonal interaction, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, interest, or activities. The appropriate screening and diagnosis must be realized to improve the children's prognosis. Moreover, appropriate treatments are necessary to promote better social integration and development. In this scenario, this systematic review aims to evaluate the impacts of behavioral therapies applied in healthcare settings for patients with ASD. This systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines. The databases MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL (Cochrane), and Lilacs were accessed, and gray and manual searches were performed. The search strategy was created with terms referring to autism and behavioral therapy. The studies were assessed qualitatively. Randomized clinical trials and observational studies demonstrated improvements in cognitive and verbal components of patients who received behavioral therapies in therapeutic settings. These results indicate a positive impact of both cognitive-behavioral therapy and ESDM on the development of patients' skills. Among the cognitive-behavioral therapies, the one based on the MASSI protocol did not impact the reduction of anxious symptoms. As for cognitive-behavioral therapy, one study demonstrated that the Behavioral Intervention for Anxiety in Children with Autism (BIACA), when compared to the Coping Cat protocol, improves cognition and reduces anxiety symptoms. Despite these results, further randomized clinical trials comparing behavioral therapies with one another are needed. In the context of behavioral therapy within a healthcare setting, the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) showed improvements in the cognitive, verbal, and social aspects of the evaluated patients. Improvement in scores sometimes is achieved independently of the group and related to the time of interventions.","Santos Clara Lucato Dos, Barreto Indyanara Inacio, Silva Ana Carolina Furian da,

This randomized, controlled trial involved 38 children with ADHD and 42 children with ASD, aged 5-16 years, who received probiotics (Lactiplantibacillus plantarum and Levilactobacillus brevis 109/cfu/daily) or placebo for 12 weeks. Parent-reported symptoms were assessed using Conners' 3rd-Ed and the Social Responsiveness Scale Test, 2nd-Ed (SRS-2), and children completed the Conners Continuous Performance Test, 3rd-Ed (CPT 3) or Conners Kiddie CPT, 2nd-Ed (K-CPT 2). Executive functions, quality of life and sleep patterns were also parent-assessed. Intention-to-treat analyses, controlling for sociodemographic and nutritional covariates, revealed no significant inter-group differences in parent-reported or neuropsychological data after the probiotic intervention. However, age-stratified analyses showed improved hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms in younger children with ASD (Cohen's d = 1.245) and ADHD (Cohen's d = 0.692). Intra-group analyses supported these findings in the aforementioned age and intervention group for both diagnoses. An improvement in impulsivity for children with ASD was also observed in the intra-group analysis of the CPT commissions scores (probiotic: p = 0.001, Cohen's d = -1.216; placebo: p = 0.013, Cohen's d = -0.721). A better comfort score (quality of life) was shown in children with ASD (probiotic: p = 0.010, Cohen's d = 0.722; placebo: p = 0.099, Cohen's d = 0.456). The probiotics used, may improve hyperactivity-impulsivity in children with ASD or/and ADHD and quality of life in children with ASD.

Presently, oxytocin nasal spray has shown significant potential in the treatment of stress-related neuropsychiatric diseases. However, there are few reports on the use of oxytocin nasal spray in postoperative ASD, a condition that can potentially develop into a high-risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorder. This study aims to investigate the effect of pretreatment with oxytocin nasal spray on postoperative ASD in patients with accidental trauma and fracture to provide new clinical insights for the prevention of postoperative ASD. This study is a single-centre, double-blind, randomised controlled clinical trial. The trial aims to recruit 328 patients with accidental traumatic fractures who underwent surgical treatment. Participants will be randomly categorised into two groups: a control group (0.9% normal saline nasal spray, 1 mL) and an oxytocin group (oxytocin nasal spray, 1 mL/40 IU) at a ratio of 1:1 using the random number table method. The primary outcome is the incidence of ASD on postoperative days 1-3. Secondary outcomes include patient resilience, anxiety, depression and pain scores on postoperative days 1-3. The exploratory results include the concentrations of stress response indicators such as malondialdehyde, cortisol and superoxide dismutase in the saliva before the first intervention and on days 1-3 after surgery. The trial was approved by the clinical research ethics committee of the General Hospital of the Western Theater Command (identifier: 2024EC3-ky014). The findings of this trial will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal and in national or international paediatric research to guide future practice.

"39861928","10.1177/02698811241309621","Toward effective oxytocin interventions in autism: Overcoming challenges and harnessing opportunities.","2025-03-01","Intranasal administration of oxytocin is emerging as a potential pharmacological option for mitigating social difficulties and regulating stress in autism spectrum disorder. However, initial single-dose and multiple-dose trials showed mixed results, with some demonstrating improvements in social and repetitive behavior and others showing no benefit over placebo. This perspective aims to elucidate factors contributing to this variability and to highlight pitfalls and opportunities in the field. We identified two major factors: design-related elements and individual participant characteristics. Pertaining to design-related elements, optimal dosing regimens have yet to be established, but appear to favor moderate intervention durations (i.e., 4-6 weeks) with intermittent and intermediate dosing (i.e., 24-32 IU every other day). Also, the context of the intervention seems crucial, as enhanced outcomes are mainly observed when oxytocin administration is paired with a socially stimulating and supporting environment. In addition, more adequate outcome measures have to be established to effectively assess oxytocin's impact, including behavioral scales and objective biophysiological markers tapping into stress and neurophysiological regulation. Future research should also account for individual participant differences in biological sex, developmental stage and cognitive and adaptive functioning, and incorporate (epi)genetic screening to identify responders. Overall, refining study designs and personalizing intervention protocols are essential for optimizing oxytocin's prosocial and anxiolytic effect in autism.","Ricchiuti Grazia, Tuerlinckx Elise,

In recent years, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been applied in interventions for ASD, often targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). However, studies investigating anodal and cathodal tDCS interventions have reported differing outcomes. Therefore, this study aimed to compare and analyze the effects of these two stimulations through a randomized controlled trial, utilizing both behavioral assessments and EEG proxy markers capable of characterizing the brain's excitatory-inhibitory balance. This study recruited a total of 24 children with ASD (20 males and 4 females; mean age ± SD: 5.5 ± 1.2 years), who were randomly divided into two groups receiving either anodal or cathodal tDCS targeting the DLPFC. The stimulation intensity was set at 1 mA, administered five times per week for a total of 20 sessions. Behavioral intervention outcomes were assessed using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and the Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC). Additionally, the study evaluated the effects of tDCS on the brain's excitatory-inhibitory balance by analyzing corrected periodic alpha oscillation power and bandwidth, as well as non-periodic exponent and offset derived from EEG data. Following anodal tDCS intervention, results from the SRS scale indicated a decrease in overall scores, with significant differences observed in social communication and social motivation among children. On the ABC scale, overall scores also decreased, with significant differences noted in sensory behavior, social relating, body and object use, and language and communication skills. Non-periodic exponent and offsets increased following anodal tDCS stimulation, whereas they decreased after cathodal tDCS stimulation. Regarding alpha oscillation power, there was a significant increase following anodal tDCS and a significant decrease following cathodal tDCS. In terms of alpha oscillation bandwidth, there was a reduction following anodal tDCS and an increase following cathodal tDCS. Further correlation analysis revealed that in children who received anodal tDCS intervention, non-periodic exponent showed correlations with behaviors such as social communication. Our study results demonstrated that anodal and cathodal tDCS targeting the left DLPFC had distinct effects on the behavior and excitatory-inhibitory balance of children with ASD. Anodal tDCS intervention appeared to have a more positive impact compared to cathodal intervention. However, the sample size was small, and we focused solely on the effects of tDCS, with our experimental design perhaps not being able to generalize to all external manipulations of excitability in our study. In future research, we will continue to improve the experiments to address these limitations.","Kang Jiannan, Wu Juanmei, Huang Xinping, Mao Wenqin, Li Xiaoli","IBRO neuroscience reports",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39896718","Child Rehabilitation Division, Ningbo Rehabilitation Hospital, Ningbo, China.; State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Beijing, China.",

Growing evidence suggests that alterations in brain networks may contribute to ASD symptoms. The cerebellum, with its widespread connections to the cortex, has emerged as a potential key player in ASD. Non-invasive neuromodulation techniques, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) offer a promising avenue for modulating brain activity and potentially alleviating ASD symptoms. In addition, preclinical studies in rodents further emphasize the therapeutic effect of cerebellar stimulation to target autism-related symptoms. This article reviews both clinical and preclinical studies aiming to modulate cerebellar circuits to improve symptoms of ASD. We found ten relevant studies assessing the effect of cerebellar neuromodulation in human and preclinical models. Posterior cerebellar tDCS represented the most frequent neuromodulation method and suggested that cerebellar tDCS can lead to improvements in symptoms of ASD and restore cerebellar connectivity in individuals with ASD. In neurotypical participants, there is evidence that cerebellar tDCS can enhance social cognitive abilities. These results are in line with preclinical studies, suggesting that chemogenetic stimulation can modulate cerebellar circuits involved in ASD and improve related behaviors. Further research is needed to establish standardized protocols, assess long-term effects, and investigate the underlying mechanisms of cerebellar stimulation. We examine research questions that need to be addressed before launching large scale randomized clinical trials.","Elandaloussi Yannis, Dufrenne Océane, Lefebvre Aline, Houenou Josselin, Senova Suhan,

"39960783","10.1097/Dbp.0000000000001334","Glutathione, Vitamin C, and Cysteine Use in Autistic Children With Disruptive Behavior: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Crossover Pilot Study.",,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by social communication differences and restricted interests. One proposed biologic mechanism underlying ASD is oxidative stress, leading to the clinical use of glutathione based on anecdotal reports of improved behavior in autistic children. In this pilot study, we tested this observation using a randomized clinical trial format to collect preliminary data on glutathione safety and efficacy. Glutathione and glutathione in combination with vitamin C and N-acetylcysteine (Trio) were tested. Both treatments were administered in double-blind placebo-controlled randomized crossover studies. In total, 24 children between the ages of 5 and 16 years with ASD and severe behavior disorders were randomized to receive weekly intravenous injections of either placebo or 1 of the 2 interventions (glutathione or Trio) for 8 weeks. After a 1-week washout period, participants were crossed over for the subsequent 8 weeks. Behavioral measures and plasma levels of glutathione were obtained at baseline, during the washout period, and at the end of the study. No differences between treatment groups in behavioral or biologic measures were found. No significant adverse side effects attributable to the treatments were observed. Small improvements in specific glutathione and behavioral measures occurred over the study period for all groups. Treatment with glutathione or glutathione in combination with vitamin C and N-acetylcysteine did not result in improvements in behavior or biologic measures. The positive trends over the course of the study were likely due to the placebo effect or decreased anxiety associated with the study routine.","Williams Patricia Gail, Sears Lonnie, Watson Walter H,

"39989401","10.1002/Aur.70013","Parent Outcomes from a Randomized Controlled Trial Investigating a Modular Behavioral Intervention for Young Autistic Children.","2025-03-01","We assessed parent stress and competence outcomes from participation in a randomized controlled trial of a modular behavioral intervention (Modular Approach for Young Autistic Children; MAYAC) compared to a treatment-as-usual comprehensive behavioral intervention (CBI). Throughout their participation, parents of military families were included in their child's treatment (e.g., identifying goals, learning strategies to support their child) and reported on their feelings of stress using the Parenting Stress Index-4, Short Form (PSI-4), as well as their feelings of satisfaction and efficacy as a parent on the Parenting Sense of Competence (PSOC) scale. A linear mixed model evaluated the differences in stress and competence from baseline to each assessment period through follow-up. There were no significant differences between groups in stress or competence ratings; however, there were within-group changes in both treatment arms over the course of the trial. In both groups, parent stress decreased, and competence increased over time, continuing to suggest that behavioral analytic intervention for young children with autism can promote positive parent outcomes.

Therapies specifically targeting RBs have been underexplored despite advances in understanding their neurobiological basis. This study aims to evaluate whether high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) can reduce dysfunctional RBs in autistic children and investigate whether improvements differ between lower-order and higher-order RBs based on the brain regions stimulated. The study entails a multi-session, sham-controlled, site-controlled, double-blind, and between-subjects design. The study will include participants with an ASD diagnosis (aged 8-13 years; IQ ≥ 70), who will undergo the HD-tDCS intervention for 10 sessions. Participants will be randomly assigned to three conditions: (1) Pre-Motor Active Group (active HD-tDCS over pre-SMA cortex); (2) Frontal Active Group (active HD-tDCS over dlPFC); (3) Placebo Control Group. In the active HD-tDCS conditions, the current will be delivered through a 4 × 1 montage; small circular electrodes will be used with the cathode placed centrally with a current intensity of 0.5 mA for a total of 20 min (30 s ramp up/down) per session. Participants during the sham condition will undergo the same procedures as those in the both active conditions actual placement of electrodes, and turning on the HD-tDCS equipment (30 s). The assessment will be completed at baseline (T0), immediately after the end of the intervention (T1) and 3 months after the end of the intervention (T2). The primary outcome measure will be the Total Score of the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised. The secondary outcomes measures will comprise ASD symptoms, sensory processing pattern, emotional/behavioral problems, sleep functioning, parental stress, neuropsychological features and High-Density EEG connectivity. We hypothesize that active HD-tDCS will lead to significant reduction in the total score of the primary outcome compared to Sham Group, with site-specific effects on lower-order and higher-order RBs. HD-tDCS is an easy-to-deliver, time-efficient, neurobiologically-driven intervention that could be performed as add-on to reduce the time of conventional therapy for ASD. Given the inherent limitations of specific interventions for RBs, tDCS represents an important ""third"" treatment arm to address the burden of interventions for ASD.

However, in prior trials, autistic individuals with co-occurring intellectual disability (ID) have largely been overlooked, despite their high prevalence, poorer outcome, and the enhanced need but reduced availability of therapeutic interventions. Prior studies have also overlooked the importance of standardizing the context in which oxytocin is administered, rendering outcomes from prior trials inconclusive. To meet these limitations, we propose a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial investigating the effects of intermittent multiple-dose intranasal oxytocin administration (4 weeks, 24 IU 3x/week), administered within a standardized psychosocial stimulating context at special need schools, in 80 children with autism and co-occurring ID (4-13 years old). Clinical-behavioral as well as stress-regulatory effects of oxytocin will be evaluated using the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC), the Brief Observation of Social Communication Change (BOSCC) expert rating scale, and measurements of high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), a validated index of parasympathetic autonomic nervous system activity. To assess the possibility of retention and/or late-emerging effects, outcomes will be assessed immediately after the administration regime, and at two follow-up sessions, four-weeks and six months after administration. Significant clinical-behavioral improvements on the ATEC and BOSCC, and significantly higher parasympathetic HF-HRV power in the oxytocin compared to the placebo group would confirm beneficial clinical-behavioral and stress-regulatory effects of oxytocin in autistic children with co-occurring ID. This would also corroborate the use of intermittent dosing schemes in combination with concomitant psychosocial stimulation. The trial was registered on the 9th of December 2022 at the European Clinical Trial Registry (EudraCT 2022-002423-36) and on 20th of September the trial was transferred to the EU Clinical Trial Register (EU CT 2024-513436-14).","Ricchiuti G, Taillieu A, Tuerlinckx E, Prinsen J, Debbaut E, Steyaert J, Boets B, Alaerts Kaat","BMC psychiatry","Humans, Oxytocin, Child, Double-Blind Method, Intellectual Disability, Child, Preschool, Adolescent, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Male, Female, Stress, Psychological, Administration, Intranasal, Autistic Disorder, Social Behavior","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40033311","Neuromodulation Laboratory, Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, KU Leuven, Tervuursevest 101, box 1501, 3001, Leuven, Belgium.; Neuromodulation Laboratory, Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, KU Leuven, Tervuursevest 101, box 1501, 3001, Leuven, Belgium. kaat.alaerts@kuleuven.be.; Leuven Autism Research (LAuRes), KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.",

Previous research indicates that ASD without intellectual impairment is associated with underactivity and reduced functional connectivity of the brain's mentalizing pathway, to which the right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ) serves as an important entry point and hub. In this study, we aim to utilize functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to localize activation maxima in the rTPJ and other regions involved in social cognition to generate individualized targets for neuro-navigated, intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) in order to modulate brain activity in a region centrally engaged in social information processing. In this single-blind, randomized, between-subject neuroimaging-guided brain stimulation study we plan to recruit 52 participants with prediagnosed ASD and 52 controls without ASD aged between 18 and 65 years. Participants will be classified into two groups and will randomly receive one session of either verum- or sham-iTBS. Effects will be assessed by using well-established experimental tasks that interrogate social behaviour, but also use computational modelling to investigate brain stimulation effects at this level. This study aims to use personalized, non-invasive brain stimulation to alter social information processing in adults with and without high-functioning ASD, which has not been studied before with a similar protocol or a sample size of this magnitude. By doing so in combination with behavioural and computational tasks, this study has the potential to provide new mechanistic insights into the workings of the social brain.

"40170032","10.1186/S12887-025-05587-8","A hybrid type I randomized effectiveness-implementation trial of a Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Intervention in the Part C early intervention system: study protocol.","2025-04-01","Participation in Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBI) is associated with significant improvements in functioning for toddlers with, and showing early signs of, autism spectrum disorder. The Part C Early Intervention (EI) system, which is publicly funded and available in all U.S. states, offers an optimal infrastructure through which toddlers can receive NDBIs. This study seeks to assess the effectiveness and fit of one NDBI, Caregiver Implemented Reciprocal Imitation Teaching (CI-RIT), within the Part C EI system. This hybrid type 1 effectiveness/implementation trial uses a multi-site randomized control design to simultaneously test effectiveness and collect implementation data on CI-RIT in the Part C EI system across four states: Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan and Washington. Participants include EI providers (target n = 160) who are randomized to either CI-RIT or treatment as usual (TAU), and child/caregiver dyads on their caseloads (target n = 440). Primary effectiveness outcomes focus on (1) child social communication, joint attention, motor imitation; and (2) caregiver responsivity, implementation fidelity of RIT, and self-efficacy, which are all measured at baseline and then 4-months and 9-months after baseline. Implementation outcomes include CI-RIT modifications, treatment acceptability, fidelity of CI-RIT coaching, and RIT session completion. This study represents a critical effort to transport an evidence-based NDBI, CI-RIT, into a national service delivery setting, the Part C EI system. The large, multi-site nature of the trial provides the opportunity to address critical questions about training and intervention effectiveness, which will, in turn, optimize and support CI-RIT implementation at scale. The trial protocol is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05114538; Registration date: 10/28/2021).","Wainer Allison L, Edmunds Sarah R, Carter Alice S, Stone Wendy L, Sheldrick R Christopher, Broder-Fingert Sarabeth, Stern Yael S, Harrington Ellie, V Ibanez Lisa, Ingersoll Brooke","BMC pediatrics","Humans, Early Intervention, Educational, Child, Preschool, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Infant, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, United States","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40170032","Department of Psychology, Michigan State University, 316 Physics Rd., Room 105B, East Lansing, MI, 48824, USA.; Department of Psychology, University of Washington, Guthrie Hall Box 351525, Seattle, WA, 98195, USA.; Department of Psychology, University of Massachusetts Boston, 100 Morrissey Boulevard, Boston, MA, 02125, USA.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Rush University Medical Center, 1645 W.

Our study aimed to compare gut microbiota composition between these disorders and evaluate the effect of probiotic supplementation. We conducted a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 80 children aged 5-14 years (39 with ADHD, 41 with ASD). Baseline and post-intervention fecal samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing to identify changes in gut microbiota composition. We identified 22 taxa differentiating ADHD and ASD (AUC = 0.939), characterised by increased presence of Clostridia, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae in ADHD, and Bacteroides, Bacilli and Actinobacteria in ASD. These differences remained after accounting for potential confounders. ASD children receiving probiotics had significant increases in Chao 1, Fisher's alpha, and Shannon indices whereas no significant differences in α and β-diversity were found in ADHD. In ADHD, bacteria with potential adverse effects were under-represented. In ASD, the abundance of Eggerthellaceae, and other taxa associated with gastrointestinal problems and anxiety was decreased. Variations in gut microbiota may influence responses in ADHD and ASD. Probiotic supplementation favorably altered gut microbiota composition, offering insights for future therapeutic strategies targeting the microbiome in neurodevelopmental disorders. Recent research underscores the role of gut microbiota in ADHD and ASD, indicating that diet can significantly influence microbiota composition and potentially manage these neurodevelopmental disorders. This study reveals distinct differences in gut microbiota composition between children with ADHD and ASD and demonstrates that probiotic supplementation can modulate specific microbial genera in each disorder. These findings pave the way for the development of innovative microbiome-targeted therapies, offering a new avenue for the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders. Understanding this relationship is crucial for designing future interventions.","Novau-Ferré Nil, Papandreou Christopher, Rojo-Marticella Meritxell, Canals-Sans Josefa, Bulló Mònica","Research in developmental disabilities",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40184961","Nutrition and Metabolic Health Research Group (NuMeH).

There is currently no reference treatment or specific pharmacological treatment recommendation on the management of sleep disturbances in children and adolescents suffering from PTSD, despite the fact that they have a significant effect on daytime functioning and overall mental health of children as well as on family's health and quality of life. In this respect, paediatric prolonged-release melatonin (PedPRM) has shown significant beneficial effects on insomnia disorders in children with autism spectrum disorders and positive effects on anxiety and depressive symptomatology. Our study will be the first randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of PedPRM melatonin on sleep disorders in children and adolescents with PTSD, as well as on PTSD symptoms, associated daytime functioning and overall mental health in these children and their caregivers.<b>Methods/design</b>: The MelatoSOM-Kids-PTSD study (French national hospital-based clinical research programme) will be a multi-centre prospective double-blind placebo-controlled parallel group clinical trial investigating the efficacy of paediatric prolonged-release melatonin to alleviate sleep disturbances in children and adolescents with PTSD (120 participants recruited over a 24-month period). The experimental group will be treated with active prolonged-release melatonin over 13 weeks (PedPRM). The control group will receive a placebo. The primary endpoint will be the difference in sleep diary derived total sleep time after 13 weeks of treatment in the PedPRM group versus placebo group. Secondary endpoints will be the differences in objective sleep quality parameters and daytime functioning before and after treatment, in children with PTSD and their caregivers.<b>Discussion</b>: This paper describes the MelatoSOM-Kids-PTSD protocol, which will evaluate the effectiveness of melatonin, a treatment that has already demonstrated an excellent benefit-risk ratio in the paediatric population over 4 years.","Rolling Julie, Reynaud Eve, Mengin Amaury C, Zanfonato Thomas, Bourgin Patrice, Schroder Carmen M","European journal of psychotraumatology","Adolescent, Child, Female, Humans, Male, Delayed-Action Preparations, Double-Blind Method, Melatonin, Prospective Studies, Quality of Life, Sleep Wake Disorders, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic, Treatment Outcome, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40243149","Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Strasbourg University Hospitals, Strasbourg, France.; Regional Center for Psychotrauma Great East, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France.; Sleep Disorders Center, International Research Center for ChronoSomnology, Strasbourg University Hospitals, Strasbourg, France.",

This multicenter, double-blind, 2-armed, sham-controlled randomized clinical trial, conducted from May 1, 2022, through November 30, 2023, assessed children aged 3 to 14 years with ASD at 8 medical centers in China. Participants underwent daily 20-minute sessions of active tPCS (0.7 mA) or sham tPCS (brief 0.7 mA ramp-up and ramp-down) for 20 sessions over 4 weeks with anode over the right cerebellar hemisphere and cathode over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (12.56-cm2-circular, 4-cm-diameter circular electrodes). Each day after tPCS, all participants received 1 hour of standard therapy. Social functioning was assessed using the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included the Autism Behavior Checklist and the Childhood Sleep Habits Questionnaire. A total of 312 participants (155 in the active group and 157 in the sham group; 248 [79.5%] boys; mean [SD] age, 5.1 [1.6] years; 276 [88.5%] aged 3-6 years and 36 [11.5%] aged 7-14 years) completed the trial. After 20 sessions, the mean Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist total score improved by 4.13 points (5.8%) in the sham tPCS group and 7.17 points (10.7%) in the active tPCS group. Analysis of covariance showed significantly greater improvement in the active tPCS group (difference, -3.50; 95% CI, -5.56 to -1.43; P < .001). Both treatments were well tolerated. In this randomized clinical trial of prefrontal-cerebellar tPCS in children aged 3 to 14 years with ASD, 20 sessions over 4 weeks improved social functioning and sleep.

In a study of 61 aggressive school-age children diagnosed as undersocialized, aggressive conduct disorder, a subsample of 21 children received lithium. Saliva lithium levels aided in monitoring side effects, and in 15 of the 21 children simultaneous saliva and serum lithium levels were done. These were highly correlated (r = 0.83) and the saliva to serum ratio was 2.53 across subjects. The results indicate that future work with larger numbers of children should study the ratio of saliva to serum lithium levels. Adult studies have shown that there is too great a variability in saliva to serum lithium level ratios to support the use of a fixed saliva to serum lithium ratio. This may not be the case in children. Seventeen children from the lithium subsample experienced 41 lithium-related side effects. Most children suffered side effects on relatively high doses of lithium, and those few who experienced side effects on low dosage had saliva lithium levels that were proportionately high. However, it remains unclear whether saliva lithium can be used to monitor side effects.","Perry R, Campbell M, Grega D M, Anderson L","Journal of clinical psychopharmacology","Child, Child Behavior Disorders, Child, Preschool, Double-Blind Method, Haloperidol, Humans, Kinetics, Lithium, Placebos, Random Allocation, Saliva","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6470191",,

Valproate appears useful for the treatment of these target symptoms in several disorders, and carbamazepine has been found effective for such symptoms in borderline personality disorder. We therefore conducted a preliminary open-label trial of valproate in borderline personality disorder. Eleven patients who met DSM-III-R criteria for borderline personality disorder were entered into an 8-week study of valproate. Exclusion criteria included current major depression or major medical disorder. All patients were in psychotherapy at least once a week for a minimum of 8 weeks prior to starting medication. Valproate was increased as tolerated to reach blood levels of 50 to 100 micrograms/mL. Clinician- and self-rated scales were completed each week. Three patients did not complete the study. Of completers, 4 of 8 patients were responders (""much less"" or ""less"") on clinician-rated change scores for overall pathology and for mood. Three of 8 patients were responders on change scores for anxiety, anger, impulsivity, and rejection sensitivity. There was a significant (p = .03) decrease in total Symptom Checklist-90 scores between the start and end of the trial.

In addition, differences in learning the extinction rates systematically varied with age thus suggesting a developmental conditioning abnormality in autism. The observed pattern of eye-blink conditioning may indicate that persons with autism have the ability to rapidly associate paired stimuli but, depending on processing of certain contextual information, have impairments in modulating the timing and topography of the learned responses.

This hypothesis has now received strong support and is currently based on three types of arguments: (1) similarity between autistic symptomatology and abnormal behaviors induced in young animals by injections of exogenous opioids, such as increasing social aloofness and decreasing social vocalization; (2) direct biochemical evidence of abnormalities of peripheral endogenous opioids being reported in autism and (3) therapeutic effects of the long lasting opioid receptor blocking agent naltrexone in autism. In this article, we give description of open and double-blind studies of naltrexone in autism. Naltrexone has been tested in several open studies. We performed an open trial with naltrexone in 2 autistic girls, displaying serious self-injurious behavior, reduced crying and a marked preference for salty and spicy foods, symptoms that could be related to a dysfunction of the opioid system. With dosages of 1 mg/kg/day, we observed an immediate reduction of hyperactivity, self-injurious behavior and aggressiveness, while attention improved. In addition, social behaviors, smiling, social seeking behaviors and play interactions increased (Leboyer, Bouvard et Dugas, 1988). Campbell et al.

Modest clinical benefits were achieved with both PLC and NTX, with marginally better overall results following NTX, and degree of improvement appeared to be related to plasma chemical profiles. Massively elevated levels of beta-endorphin were observed in all children with assays using C-terminal antibody but not with an N-terminal antibody assay. In addition, 70% of the children exhibited abnormally low levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone, and smaller subsets exhibited elevated norepinephrine (60%), arginine-vasopressin (50%), and serotonin (20%). The best clinical responders exhibited the clearest normalization of the elevated plasma chemistries, especially in C-terminal-beta-endorphin and serotonin. There was some evidence of therapeutic carry-over effects in both clinical and biochemical measures in those children who received NTX before PLC. The results suggest that NTX only benefits a subgroup of autistic children, who may be identified by the presence of certain plasma abnormalities.

The present experiment assessed collateral effects of two very different parent training paradigms during unstructured dinnertime interactions in the family setting. One paradigm focused on teaching individual target behaviors (ITB) serially, and the other focused on a recently developed naturalistic paradigm that teaches the pivotal responses (PRT) of motivation and responsivity to multiple cues. Two groups of families were randomly assigned to each of the parent training conditions. Pretraining and post-parent-training videotapes of dinnertime interactions were scored in a random order across four interactional scales (level of happiness, interest, stress, and style of communication). Results obtained for the four interactional scales showed that the families in both conditions initially scored in the neutral range, and the ITB training paradigm produced no significant influence on the interactions from pretraining to posttraining. In contrast, however the PRT parent training paradigm resulted in the families showing positive interactions on all four scales, with the parent-child interactions rated as happier, the parents more interested in the interaction, the interaction less stressful, and the communication style as more positive.","Koegel R L, Bimbela A, Schreibman L","Journal of autism and developmental disorders","Autistic Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Child, Child, Preschool, Combined Modality Therapy, Family, Family Therapy, Female, Humans, Male, Motivation, Parents, Personality Assessment, Social Environment, Socialization, Treatment Outcome","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8792265","Counseling/Clinical/School Psychology Program, Graduate School of Education, University of California, Santa Barbara 93106-9490, USA.",

Twelve autistic patients ranging from 7 to 15 years, diagnosed according to DSM-III-R, entered a double-blind crossover study with NAL at the doses of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mg/kg every 48 hours. The behavioural evaluation was conducted using the specific BSE and CARS rating scales NAL treatment produced a significant reduction of the autistic symptomatology in seven (""responders"") out of 12 children. The behavioural improvement was accompanied by alterations in the distribution of the major lymphocyte subsets, with a significant increase of the T-helper-inducers (CD4+CD8-) and a significant reduction of the T-cytotoxic-suppressor (CD4-CD8+) resulting in a normalization of the CD4/CD8 ratio. Changes in natural killer cells and activity were inversely related to plasma beta-endorphin levels.

Cerebrospinal fluid inositol has been reported as decreased in depression. A double-blind controlled trial of 12 g daily of inositol in 28 depressed patients for four weeks was performed. Significant overall benefit for inositol compared to placebo was found at week 4 on the Hamilton Depression Scale. No changes were noted in hematology, kidney or liver function. Since many antidepressants are effective in panic disorder, twenty-one patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia completed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, four week, random-assignment crossover treatment trial of inositol 12 g per day. Frequency and severity of panic attacks and severity of agoraphobia declined significantly with inositol compared to placebo. Side-effects were minimal. Since serotonin re-uptake inhibitors benefit obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and inositol is reported to reverse desensitization of serotonin receptors, thirteen patients with OCD completed a double-blind controlled crossover trial of 18 g inositol or placebo for six weeks each. Inositol significantly reduced scores of OCD symptoms compared with placebo. A controlled double-blind crossover trial of 12 g daily of inositol for a month in twelve anergic schizophrenic patients, did not show any beneficial effects. A double-blind controlled crossover trial of 6 g of inositol daily vs. glucose for one month each was carried out in eleven Alzheimer patients, with on clearly significant therapeutic effects. Antidepressant drugs have been reported to improve attention deficit disorder (ADDH) with hyperactivity symptomatology. We studied oral inositol in children with ADDH in a double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled manner. Eleven children, mean age 8.9 +/- 3.6 years were enrolled in an eight week trial of inositol or placebo at a dose of 200 mg/kg body weight. Results show a trend for aggravation of the syndrome with myo-inositol as compared to placebo. Recent studies suggest that serotonin re-uptake inhibitors are helpful in at least some symptoms of autism. However a controlled double-blind crossover trial of inositol 200 mg/kg per day showed no benefit in nine children with autism. Cholinergic agonists have been reported to ameliorate electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)-induced memory impairment. Inositol metabolism is involved in the second messenger system for several muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Inositol 6 g daily was given in a crossover-double-blind manner for five days before the fifth or sixth ECT to a series of twelve patients, without effect.

Accelerating research interest in the role of antecedents reveals that a large array of stimulus variables can influence the rate of problem behavior. Indeed, the variety of these stimuli is so great that it is sometimes possible to overlook specific stimulus variables during initial assessment. The present study shows that a failure to identify these very specific (idiosyncratic) stimulus variables is serious because their presence can systematically alter the outcomes of functional analyses that are designed to assess the motivation of problem behavior.

Open-label reports suggest that the serotonin2A-dopamine D2 antagonist risperidone may be safe and effective in reducing the interfering symptoms of patients with autism. Thirty-one adults (age [mean+/-SD], 28.1+/-7.3 years) with autistic disorder (n=17) or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (n=14) participated in a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of risperidone. Patients treated with placebo subsequently received a 12-week open-label trial of risperidone. For persons completing the study, 8 (57%) of 14 patients treated with risperidone were categorized as responders (daily dose [mean+/-SD], 2.9+/-1.4 mg) compared with none of 16 in the placebo group (P<.002). Risperidone was superior to placebo in reducing repetitive behavior (P<.001), aggression (P<.001), anxiety or nervousness (P<.02), depression (P<.03), irritability (P<.01), and the overall behavioral symptoms of autism (P<.02). Objective, measurable change in social behavior and language did not occur. Nine (60%) of 15 patients who received treatment with open-label risperidone following the double-blind placebo phase responded. Other than mild, transient sedation, risperidone was well tolerated, with no evidence of extrapyramidal effects, cardiac events, or seizures. Risperidone is more effective than placebo in the short-term treatment of symptoms of autism in adults.","McDougle C J, Holmes J P, Carlson D C, Pelton G H, Cohen D J, Price L H","Archives of general psychiatry","Adolescent, Adult, Age Factors, Aggression, Antipsychotic Agents, Autistic Disorder, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Placebos, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Risperidone, Severity of Illness Index, Treatment Outcome, Weight Gain","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9672054","Department of Psychiatry, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202-5200, USA. cmcdougl@iumc.iupui.edu",

Twenty-four participants with ASD following civilian trauma were given 5 sessions of either cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or supportive counseling (SC) within 2 weeks of their trauma. Fewer participants in CBT (8%) than in SC (83%) met criteria for PTSD at posttreatment. There were also fewer cases of PTSD in the CBT condition (17%) than in the SC condition (67%) 6 months posttrauma. There were greater statistically and clinically significant reductions in intrusive, avoidance, and depressive symptomatology among the CBT participants than among the SC participants. This study represents the 1st demonstration of successful treatment of ASD with CBT and its efficacy in preventing chronic PTSD.","Bryant R A, Harvey A G, Dang S T, Sackville T, Basten C","Journal of consulting and clinical psychology","Accidents, Acute Disease, Adult, Analysis of Variance, Chi-Square Distribution, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Counseling, Female, Humans, Life Change Events, Longitudinal Studies, Male, Middle Aged, Social Support, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic, Stress, Psychological, Survivors, Treatment Outcome","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9803707","School of Psychology, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia. r.bryant@unsw.edu.au",
