"35","Modular Approach for Young Autistic Children (MAYAC)",,"Parent stress and competence","Parenting Stress Index-4 (PSI-4) and Parenting Sense of Competence (PSOC)","We assessed parent stress and competence outcomes from participation in a randomized controlled trial of a modular behavioral intervention (Modular Approach for Young Autistic Children; MAYAC) compared to a treatment-as-usual comprehensive behavioral intervention (CBI). Throughout their participation, parents of military families were included in their child's treatment (e.g., identifying goals, learning strategies to support their child) and reported on their feelings of stress using the Parenting Stress Index-4, Short Form (PSI-4), as well as their feelings of satisfaction and efficacy as a parent on the Parenting Sense of Competence (PSOC) scale. A linear mixed model evaluated the differences in stress and competence from baseline to each assessment period through follow-up. There were no significant differences between groups in stress or competence ratings; however, there were within-group changes in both treatment arms over the course of the trial. In both groups, parent stress decreased, and competence increased over time, continuing to suggest that behavioral analytic intervention for young children with autism can promote positive parent outcomes.

"38","Oxytocin (intranasal)",,"Social and repetitive behaviors","Intranasal administration of oxytocin is emerging as a potential pharmacological option for mitigating social difficulties and regulating stress in autism spectrum disorder. However, initial single-dose and multiple-dose trials showed mixed results, with some demonstrating improvements in social and repetitive behavior and others showing no benefit over placebo. This perspective aims to elucidate factors contributing to this variability and to highlight pitfalls and opportunities in the field. We identified two major factors: design-related elements and individual participant characteristics. Pertaining to design-related elements, optimal dosing regimens have yet to be established, but appear to favor moderate intervention durations (i.e., 4-6 weeks) with intermittent and intermediate dosing (i.e., 24-32 IU every other day). Also, the context of the intervention seems crucial, as enhanced outcomes are mainly observed when oxytocin administration is paired with a socially stimulating and supporting environment. In addition, more adequate outcome measures have to be established to effectively assess oxytocin's impact, including behavioral scales and objective biophysiological markers tapping into stress and neurophysiological regulation. Future research should also account for individual participant differences in biological sex, developmental stage and cognitive and adaptive functioning, and incorporate (epi)genetic screening to identify responders. Overall, refining study designs and personalizing intervention protocols are essential for optimizing oxytocin's prosocial and anxiolytic effect in autism. ",,"88"

This study examined the effect of telehealth delivery of a parent-mediated NDBI, Project ImPACT, on children's expressive language ability using a randomized control trial with intent-to-treat analysis. Sixty-four young autistic children and their primary caregiver were matched on age and developmental quotient and randomly assigned to receive 6 months of therapist-assisted Project ImPACT (i.e., telehealth coaching), self-directed Project ImPACT, or an active control. Parent-child interactions were recorded at intake and immediately post-treatment, and the children's expressive language skills were assessed at intake and a 9-month follow-up using standardized measures. Although there was no total effect of treatment group assignment on child outcomes, a serial mediation analysis revealed that therapist-assisted ImPACT had an indirect effect on children's expressive language ability at follow-up through their parents' use of the intervention strategies and their intentional communication immediately post-treatment. Findings support Project ImPACT's program theory and highlight the importance of coaching in achieving positive outcomes when delivered via telehealth.

There is currently no treatment for ASD for providing significant improvement in core symptoms. Recent studies suggest, however, that ASD is associated with gut dysbiosis, indicating that modulation of gut microbiota in children with ASD may thus reduce the manifestation of ASD symptoms. The aim of this pilot study (prospective randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled) was to evaluate efficacy of the biological response modifier Juvenil in modulating the microbiome of children with ASD and, in particular, whether Juvenil is able to alleviate the symptoms of ASD. In total, 20 children with ASD and 12 neurotypical children were included in our study. Supplementation of ASD children lasted for three months. To confirm Juvenil's impact on the gut microbiome, stool samples were collected from all children and the microbiome's composition was analyzed. This pilot study demonstrated that the gut microbiome of ASD children differed significantly from that of healthy controls and was converted by Juvenil supplementation toward a more neurotypical microbiome that positively modulated children's autism symptoms.

"71","Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback (HRVB)",,"Adolescents with autism","Adolescents with autism present lower levels of cardiac vagal modulation. It was hypothesized that Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback (HRVB) increases cardiac vagal modulation in adolescents with autism, resulting in positive effects on physiological and psychosocial parameters. It was also hypothesized that home-based HRVB training is feasible. In a single-blind, randomized sham-controlled pilot trial, adolescents with autism performed supervised HRVB (n = 24) or sham training (n = 20). Subsequently, half of the adolescents received HRVB training at home, whereas the other subset did not practice. Physiological, cortisol and behavioral data were collected during stress-provoking assessments before and after each training period. Supervised HRVB resulted in a late increase in cardiac vagal modulation in adolescents with autism. Heart rate increased and cortisol decreased significantly immediately after supervised HRVB, but none of these effects remained after follow-up. Following supervised HRVB, no significant change in psychosocial functioning was found. Home-based HRVB was feasible, adolescents reported lower symptoms of stress, but a significant decrease in compliance rate was found. HRVB is feasible and effective in adolescents with autism given the late-emerging increases in cardiac vagal modulation and decrease in stress symptoms. Replicating this study with a larger sample and further exploration of the working mechanisms of HRVB are recommended. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04628715. ",,"315"
