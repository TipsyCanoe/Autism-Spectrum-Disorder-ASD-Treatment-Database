"38744742","Accelerated Theta Burst Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Refractory Depression in Autism Spectrum Disorder.","2025-03-01","Blank Elizabeth, Gilbert Donald L, Wu Steve W, Larsh Travis, Elmaghraby Rana, Liu Rui, Smith Elizabeth, Westerkamp Grace, Liu Yanchen, Horn Paul S, Greenstein Ethan, Sweeney John A, Erickson Craig A, Pedapati Ernest V","Journal of autism and developmental disorders","Major depressive disorder (MDD) disproportionately affects those living with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and is associated with significant impairment and treatment recidivism. We studied the use of accelerated theta burst stimulation (ATBS) for the treatment of refractory MDD in ASD (3 treatments daily x 10 days). This prospective open-label 12-week trial included 10 subjects with a mean age of 21.5 years, randomized to receive unilateral or bilateral stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. One participant dropped out of the study due to intolerability. In both treatment arms, depressive symptoms, scored on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores, diminished substantially. At 12 weeks post-treatment, full remission was sustained in 5 subjects and partial remission in 3 subjects. Treatment with ATBS, regardless of the site of stimulation, was associated with a significant, substantial, and sustained improvement in depressive symptomatology via the primary outcome measure, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Additional secondary measures, including self-report depression scales, fluid cognition, and sleep quality, also showed significant improvement. No serious adverse events occurred during the study. Mild transient headaches were infrequently reported, which are expected side effects of ATBS. Overall, ATBS treatment was highly effective and well-tolerated in individuals with ASD and co-occurring MDD. The findings support the need for a larger, sham-controlled randomized controlled trial to further evaluate efficacy of ATBS in this population.","Humans, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Autism

"38664754","Comparison of the efficacy of parent-mediated NDBIs on developmental skills in children with ASD and fidelity in parents: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.","2024-04-25","Ouyang Yuling, Feng Junyan, Wang Tiantian, Xue Yang, Mohamed Zakaria Ahmed, Jia Feiyong","BMC pediatrics","Recently, studies on behavioral interventions for autism have gained popularity. Naturalistic Developmental Behavior Interventions (NDBIs) are among the most effective, evidence-based, and widely used behavior interventions for autism. However, no research has been conducted on which of the several NDBI methods is most effective for parents and children with autism spectrum disorders. Therefore, we conducted a network meta-analysis to compare the specific effects of each type of parental-mediated NDBI on children's developmental skills and parent fidelity. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Medline, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), CINAHL, and Wanfang databases were searched from inception to August 30, 2023. A total of 32 randomized controlled trial studies that examined the efficacy of different NDBIs were included. Parents of children with ASD who received Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT) reported significant improvements in their children's social skills (SUCRA, 74.1%), language skills (SUCRA, 88.3%), and parenting fidelity (SUCRA, 99.5%). Moreover, parents who received Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) reported significant improvements in their children's language (SMD = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.79) and motor skills (SMD = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.79). In terms of the efficacy of improving parent fidelity, the results showed that the Improving Parents as Communication Teachers (ImPACT) intervention significantly improved parent fidelity when compared with the treatment-as-usual group (TAU) (SMD = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.39, 1.42) and the parental education intervention (PEI) (SMD = 1.10, 95% CI:0.28, 1.91).There was a difference in parent fidelity among parents who received PRT(SMD = 3.53, 95% CI: 2.26, 4.79) or ESDM(SMD = 1.42, 95% CI: 0.76, 2.09) training compared with PEI. In conclusion, this study revealed that parents can achieve high fidelity with the ImPACT intervention, and it can serve as an early first step for children newly diagnosed with ASD. It also showed that parent-mediated ESDM is effective in improving language and motor skills for children with ASD and can be used as part of the second stage of parent training. Parent-mediated PRT can also be used as a third stage of parent training with sufficient training intensity to further improve language, social, and motor skills.","Humans, Autism Spectrum Disorder,

"40170032","A hybrid type I randomized effectiveness-implementation trial of a Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Intervention in the Part C early intervention system: study protocol.","2025-04-01","Wainer Allison L, Edmunds Sarah R, Carter Alice S, Stone Wendy L, Sheldrick R Christopher, Broder-Fingert Sarabeth, Stern Yael S, Harrington Ellie, V Ibanez Lisa, Ingersoll Brooke","BMC pediatrics","Participation in Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBI) is associated with significant improvements in functioning for toddlers with, and showing early signs of, autism spectrum disorder. The Part C Early Intervention (EI) system, which is publicly funded and available in all U.S. states, offers an optimal infrastructure through which toddlers can receive NDBIs. This study seeks to assess the effectiveness and fit of one NDBI, Caregiver Implemented Reciprocal Imitation Teaching (CI-RIT), within the Part C EI system. This hybrid type 1 effectiveness/implementation trial uses a multi-site randomized control design to simultaneously test effectiveness and collect implementation data on CI-RIT in the Part C EI system across four states: Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan and Washington. Participants include EI providers (target n = 160) who are randomized to either CI-RIT or treatment as usual (TAU), and child/caregiver dyads on their caseloads (target n = 440). Primary effectiveness outcomes focus on (1) child social communication, joint attention, motor imitation; and (2) caregiver responsivity, implementation fidelity of RIT, and self-efficacy, which are all measured at baseline and then 4-months and 9-months after baseline. Implementation outcomes include CI-RIT modifications, treatment acceptability, fidelity of CI-RIT coaching, and RIT session completion. This study represents a critical effort to transport an evidence-based NDBI, CI-RIT, into a national service delivery setting, the Part C EI system. The large, multi-site nature of the trial provides the opportunity to address critical questions about training and intervention effectiveness, which will, in turn, optimize and support CI-RIT implementation at scale. The trial protocol is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05114538; Registration date: 10/28/2021).","Humans, Early Intervention, Educational, Child, Preschool, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Infant, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, United States","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40170032","Department of Psychology, Michigan State University, 316 Physics Rd., Room 105B, East Lansing, MI, 48824, USA.; Department of Psychology, University of Washington, Guthrie Hall Box 351525, Seattle, WA, 98195, USA.; Department of Psychology, University of Massachusetts Boston, 100 Morrissey Boulevard, Boston, MA, 02125, USA.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Rush University Medical Center, 1645 W.

"39861928","Toward effective oxytocin interventions in autism: Overcoming challenges and harnessing opportunities.","2025-03-01","Ricchiuti Grazia, Tuerlinckx Elise, Taillieu Aymara, Prinsen Jellina, Steyaert Jean, Boets Bart, Alaerts Kaat","Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)","Intranasal administration of oxytocin is emerging as a potential pharmacological option for mitigating social difficulties and regulating stress in autism spectrum disorder. However, initial single-dose and multiple-dose trials showed mixed results, with some demonstrating improvements in social and repetitive behavior and others showing no benefit over placebo. This perspective aims to elucidate factors contributing to this variability and to highlight pitfalls and opportunities in the field. We identified two major factors: design-related elements and individual participant characteristics. Pertaining to design-related elements, optimal dosing regimens have yet to be established, but appear to favor moderate intervention durations (i.e., 4-6 weeks) with intermittent and intermediate dosing (i.e., 24-32 IU every other day). Also, the context of the intervention seems crucial, as enhanced outcomes are mainly observed when oxytocin administration is paired with a socially stimulating and supporting environment. In addition, more adequate outcome measures have to be established to effectively assess oxytocin's impact, including behavioral scales and objective biophysiological markers tapping into stress and neurophysiological regulation. Future research should also account for individual participant differences in biological sex, developmental stage and cognitive and adaptive functioning, and incorporate (epi)genetic screening to identify responders. Overall, refining study designs and personalizing intervention protocols are essential for optimizing oxytocin's prosocial and anxiolytic effect in autism.","Oxytocin, Humans, Administration,

"40133861","Using personalised brain stimulation to modulate social cognition in adults with autism-spectrum-disorder: protocol for a randomised single-blind rTMS study.","2025-03-25","Brouzou Katia Ourania, Kamp Daniel, Hensel Lukas, Lüdtke Jana, Lahnakoski Juha M, Dukart Juergen, Mikus Nace, Mathys Christoph, Eickhoff Simon B, Schilbach Leonhard","BMC psychiatry","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments of social interaction and communication as well as repetitive, stereotyped behaviour. Previous research indicates that ASD without intellectual impairment is associated with underactivity and reduced functional connectivity of the brain's mentalizing pathway, to which the right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ) serves as an important entry point and hub. In this study, we aim to utilize functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to localize activation maxima in the rTPJ and other regions involved in social cognition to generate individualized targets for neuro-navigated, intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) in order to modulate brain activity in a region centrally engaged in social information processing. In this single-blind, randomized, between-subject neuroimaging-guided brain stimulation study we plan to recruit 52 participants with prediagnosed ASD and 52 controls without ASD aged between 18 and 65 years. Participants will be classified into two groups and will randomly receive one session of either verum- or sham-iTBS. Effects will be assessed by using well-established experimental tasks that interrogate social behaviour, but also use computational modelling to investigate brain stimulation effects at this level. This study aims to use personalized, non-invasive brain stimulation to alter social information processing in adults with and without high-functioning ASD, which has not been studied before with a similar protocol or a sample size of this magnitude. By doing so in combination with behavioural and computational tasks, this study has the potential to provide new mechanistic insights into the workings of the social brain.

"38941690","Effect of immersive virtual reality-based training on cognitive, social, and emotional skills in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.","2024-08-01","Mittal Palka, Bhadania Mahati, Tondak Navya, Ajmera Priyansh, Yadav Sapna, Kukreti Aditya, Kalra Sheetal, Ajmera Puneeta","Research in developmental disabilities","Virtual Reality (VR) based diagnostic and therapeutic interventions have opened up new possibilities for addressing the challenges in identifying and treating individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials to investigate the impact of Immersive VR techniques on the cognitive, social, and emotional skills of under-18 children and adolescents with ASD. Four databases were systematically searched as per ""Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses"" guidelines and assessed six RCTs for further analysis. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess the methodological quality of the studies. Pooled results favoured VR and reported significant differences between experimental and control groups concerning social skills (SMD:1.43; 95 % CI: 0.01-2.84; P: 0.05), emotional skills (SMD: 2.45; 95 % CI: 0.21-4.18; P: 0.03) and cognitive skills. VR offers an array of benefits that make it a promising tool for children and adolescents with ASD to improve their cognitive, social and emotional skills in a safe and supportive setting. However, accessibility, affordability, customization, and cost are also significant aspects to consider when developing and implementing VR-based interventions for ASD.","Humans, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Adolescent, Child, Social Skills, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Cognition, Emotions, Virtual Reality, Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38941690","School of Allied Health Sciences & Management, Delhi Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research University, New Delhi, India.; School of Physiotherapy, Delhi Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research University, New Delhi, India.; K.K.

"39608635","Umbrella Review and Meta-Analysis: The Efficacy of Nonpharmacological Interventions for Sleep Disturbances in Children and Adolescents.","2025-03-01","Hornsey Samantha J, Gosling Corentin J, Jurek Lucie, Nourredine Mikail, Telesia Laurence, Solmi Marco, Butt Isabel, Greenwell Kate, Muller Ingrid, Hill Catherine M, Cortese Samuele,  ","Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry","We conducted an umbrella review of systematic reviews (SRs), with or without meta-analysis (MA), of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing nonpharmacological sleep interventions for children and adolescents across various clinical populations. We searched multiple electronic databases up to January 24, 2024. Meta-analyzable data from RCTs in the retrieved SRs/MAs were pooled using Metaumbrella. Primary outcomes were subjective/objective child sleep parameters. Additional outcomes included child health/functioning and parental sleep/health. The quality of the MAs/SRs was assessed with Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR-2), and the certainty of evidence using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE). We included 93 SRs/MAs covering 393 RCTs, with 25 (17%, 39%, and 30%: high, moderate, and low quality) providing data for quantitative synthesis. Behavioral interventions, usually multicomponent including parent training, psychoeducation, and/or specific sleep therapy/strategies, showed beneficial effects on night waking, sleep duration, overall sleep disturbance, mood/depression, and maternal sleep quality (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.10-0.80) in participants with sleep problems without a formal sleep disorder diagnosis. For those with a formal diagnosis (mainly insomnia), benefits were found for night waking, sleep efficiency (subjective/actigraphically measured), and sleep onset latency (mean SMD = 0.49-0.97). Those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) improved in bedtime resistance, night waking, parasomnias, sleep anxiety, ADHD symptoms, sleep disturbance, and quality of life (mean SMD = 0.18-0.49). For those with autism, sleep disturbance improved (mean SMD = 0.70). However, all findings were of low to very low certainty of evidence. Among nonpharmacological interventions for sleep difficulties in youth, only behavioral interventions are supported by meta-analytic evidence, yet with small-to-moderate effect sizes and limited certainty of evidence. This ""umbrella review"" (a review of reviews) analyzed 93 systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials examining nonmedication sleep interventions for children and adolescents. The authors found that behavioral interventions, including parent training and psychoeducation, had positive effects on sleep issues like night waking, with effect sizes ranging from small to moderate. Improvements were also seen in children with ADHD and autism. However, the quality of the evidence for these benefits was rated as low to very low. This suggests that while behavioral approaches may help, more robust evidence is needed to confirm their benefits.

"39591434","Assessing plasticity in the primary sensory cortex and its relation with atypical tactile reactivity in autism: A TMS-EEG protocol.","2024-01-01","Kariminezhad Shohreh, Zomorrodi Reza, Zrenner Christoph, Blumberger Daniel M, Ameis Stephanie H, Lin Hsiang-Yuan, Lai Meng-Chuan, Rajji Tarek K, Lunsky Yona, Sanches Marcos, Desarkar Pushpal","PloS one","Atypical sensory reactivity is a cardinal presentation in autism. Within the tactile domain, atypical tactile reactivity (TR) is common, it emerges early, persists into adulthood, and impedes social interaction and daily functioning. Hence, atypical TR is a key target for biological intervention to improve outcomes. Brain mechanisms informing biological interventions for atypical TR remains elusive. We previously reported hyper-plasticity in the motor cortex in autistic adults and found that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), designed to strengthen inhibitory processes in the brain, reduced hyper-plasticity. Whether the primary sensory cortex (S1) is characterized by hyper-plasticity, which may underlie atypical TR in autism is unknown. We aim to test whether hyper-plasticity in the S1 underlies atypical TR in autism, and investigate if a single session of rTMS can safely reduce hyper-plasticity in S1 in autistic adults. Plasticity will be assessed in the left S1 with integrated paired associative stimulation and electroencephalography (PAS-EEG) paradigm in 32 autistic adults and 32 age-, sex-, and intelligence quotient-matched controls. Autistic participants will be further randomized (double-blind, 1:1) to receive a single-session of either sham or active 20 Hz bilateral rTMS over the S1 and the plasticity will be re-assessed over the left S1 on the same day. Atypical TR has been identified as one of the top clinical research priorities that can influence outcome in autistic population. The study findings can be highly valuable to further elucidate the mechanism underlying atypical TR, which in turn can help with developing a mechanism-driven intervention.","Adolescent, Adult,

"39378470","Psychoeducational and Behavioral Interventions in Autism Spectrum Disorder: is the ABA Method Really the Most Effective?","2024-09-01","Lepri Alessandro","Psychiatria Danubina","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in communication, social interactions, and repetitive behaviors. Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is a prominent intervention aimed at modifying problem behaviors in individuals with ASD. ABA focuses on analyzing environmental contingencies and using operant conditioning to promote functional behaviors. Despite its widespread use, the effectiveness of ABA remains debated, with mixed scientific evidence. Some studies highlight its benefits, while others point out biases and limitations. Further research, including randomized controlled trials, is needed to determine the most effective interventions for ASD, considering the diverse needs of individuals and the potential biases in

"39375937","Comparative effectiveness trial: Modular behavior approach for young autistic children compared to comprehensive behavioral intervention.","2024-11-01","Anderson Cynthia, Hochheimer Samantha, Warren Zachary, Butter Eric, Hyman Susan L, Wang Hongyue, Wallace Lisa, Levato Lynne, Martin Ryan, Stephenson Kevin G, Norris Megan, Jacqueline Wynn, Smith Tristram, Johnson Cynthia R","Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research","This 24-week single-blind trial tested a modular approach for young autistic children (MAYAC) that was delivered for fewer hours per week and modified based on child progress and parental input compared to comprehensive behavioral intervention treatment as usual (CBI, TAU). Participants were autistic children, ages 18-60 months of age. MAYAC was initially 5 h of intervention per week, one of which was parent training and the other four direct therapy focusing on social communication and engagement, but additional modules could be added for up to 10 h per week. Comprehensive behavior intervention was delivered for ≥15 h per week. Outcome measures included the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales; VABS, the Ohio Autism Clinical Improvement Scale - Autism Severity; OACIS - AS and the Pervasive Developmental Disorder Behavior Inventory - Parent; PDDBI-P. Implementation and parent satisfaction measures were also collected. Fifty-six children, mean age of 34 months, were randomized. Within-group analysis revealed significant improvements from baseline to week 24 for both MAYAC (p < 0.0001) and CBI, TAU (p < 0.0001) on the VABS. The noninferiority test was performed to test between group differences and MAYAC was not inferior to CBI, TAU on the VABS (p = 0.0144). On the OACIS - AS, 48.0% of MAYAC and 45.5% of CBI were treatment responders there were no significant changes on the PDDBI-P, for either group. Treatment fidelity was high for both groups (>95%) as was parent satisfaction. Findings from this small trial are promising and suggest MAYAC may be an alternative for some young autistic children and their families to CBI, TAU.","Humans, Male, Female, Behavior Therapy, Child,

"39368459","Internet-based, parent-led cognitive behavioral therapy for autistic youth with anxiety-related disorders: A randomized trial comparing email vs. telehealth support.","2024-12-01","Guzick Andrew G, Schneider Sophie C, Kook Minjee, Greenberg Rebecca, Perozo-Garcia Amanda, Lee Morgan P, Garcia Jessica, Onyeka Ogechi Cynthia, Riddle David B, Storch Eric A","Behaviour research and therapy","This study tested two versions of parent-led, Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety among autistic youth; one that provided weekly email support (iCBT-Email), and one that provided alternating bi-weekly emails and video calls (iCBT-Video) across 12 weeks. It was expected that those in the iCBT-Video condition would complete more treatment content, which in turn would lead to more anxiety improvement. Fifty-seven autistic youth (7-15 years-old) with anxiety disorders were randomized to iCBT-Email or iCBT-Video. There were no significant differences in improvement in clinician-rated, child-reported, or parent-reported anxiety severity or functional impairment. Posttreatment response rates were 55% in iCBT-Email and 67% in iCBT-Video. Module completion predicted improved treatment outcome, though there was no difference in module completion across groups. Therapists spent an average of 16.29 min/family/week (SD = 7.11) in the iCBT-Email condition and 24.13 min/family/week (SD = 6.84) in the iCBT-Video condition. Email and telehealth-supported, parent-led iCBT both appear to be effective treatments for autistic youth with anxiety disorders that require reduced therapist effort. Future research should seek novel methods to enhance engagement with iCBT content.

"39357740","Protocol of a randomized controlled trial into guided internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia in autistic adults (i-Sleep Autism).","2024-11-01","Spaargaren Kirsten L, Begeer Sander M, Greaves-Lord Kirstin, Riper Heleen, van Straten Annemieke","Contemporary clinical trials","Sleep problems, especially insomnia, are prevalent among autistic adults, affecting about 60 %, and significantly impact their quality of life. Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (iCBT-I) could provide accessible and scalable treatment. Given the unique sensory- and information processing, and social challenges at play in autism, a tailored treatment approach may be essential to tackle sleep problems. Yet, interventions developed and tested specifically for autistic adults were scarce. Addressing this gap is crucial to meet the urgent need for effective insomnia treatments in this population. With this two-arm, parallel, superiority randomized controlled trial, we will assess the effectiveness of a guided iCBT-I intervention for adults (N = 160) with autism and insomnia (i-Sleep Autism). In co-creation, i-Sleep Autism has been adjusted from an existing intervention (i-Sleep). Inclusion criteria are: age ≥ 18, an ASD diagnosis, and at least sub-threshold insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index ≥10). Participants are randomly assigned to either i-Sleep Autism or an information only waitlist control condition (online psychoeducation and sleep hygiene). After 6 weeks, the control group receives the intervention. Insomnia severity is the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include pre-sleep arousal, general mental health, depression, anxiety, daily functioning, and quality of life. Assessments will occur at baseline, mid-intervention (3 weeks), post-intervention (6 weeks), and at 6-month follow-up (the intervention group). Linear mixed-effect regression models are employed to evaluate the effectiveness of i-Sleep Autism, alongside exploration of potential moderators and mediators. This trial can reveal whether autistic adults with insomnia benefit from a guided e-health intervention.

"39342272","Study Protocol for a Cluster, Randomized, Controlled Community Effectiveness Trial of the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) Compared to Community Early Behavioral Intervention (EBI) in Community Programs serving Young Autistic Children: Partnering for Autism: Learning more to improve Services (PALMS).","2024-09-28","Stahmer Aubyn C, Dufek Sarah, Rogers Sally J, Iosif Ana-Maria","BMC psychology","The rising number of children identified with autism has led to exponential growth in for-profit applied behavior analysis (ABA) agencies and the use of highly structured approaches that may not be developmentally appropriate for young children. Multiple clinical trials support naturalistic developmental behavior interventions (NDBIs) that integrate ABA and developmental science and are considered best practices for young autistic children. The Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) is a comprehensive NDBI shown to improve social communication outcomes for young autistic children in several controlled efficacy studies. However, effectiveness data regarding NDBI use in community-based agencies are limited. This study uses a community-partnered approach to test the effectiveness of ESDM compared to usual early behavioral intervention (EBI) for improving social communication and language in autistic children served by community agencies. This is a hybrid type 1 cluster-randomized controlled trial with 2 conditions: ESDM and EBI. In the intervention group, supervising providers will receive training in ESDM; in the control group, they will continue EBI as usual. We will enroll and randomize 100 supervisors (50 ESDM, 50 EBI) by region. Each supervisor enrolls 3 families of autistic children under age 5 (n = 300) and accompanying behavior technicians (n = 200). The primary outcome is child language and social communication at 6 and 12 months. Secondary outcomes include child adaptive behavior, caregiver use of ESDM strategies, and provider intervention fidelity. Child social motivation and caregiver fidelity will be tested as mediating variables. ESDM implementation determinants will be explored using mixed methods. This study will contribute novel knowledge on ESDM effectiveness, the variables that mediate and moderate child outcomes, and engagement of its mechanisms in community use. We expect results from this trial to increase community availability of this model and access to high-quality intervention for young autistic children, especially those who depend on publicly funded intervention services. Understanding implementation determinants will aid scale-up of effective models within communities. Clinicaltrials.gov identifier number NCT06005285. Registered on August 21, 2023.

"39306958","A pilot randomised controlled trial of a telehealth-delivered brief 'Sleeping Sound Autism' intervention for autistic children.","2024-12-01","Lewis Samantha, Rinehart Nicole, Mantilla Ana, Alvares Gail, Hiscock Harriet, Marks Deborah, Papadopoulos Nicole","Sleep medicine","Access to behavioural sleep intervention is beneficial for autistic children, yet many families face barriers to access associated with location and time. Preliminary evidence supports telehealth-delivered sleep intervention. However, no studies have evaluated brief telehealth sleep intervention. To address this, we evaluated telehealth delivery of the brief behavioural Sleeping Sound Autism intervention, using a two-armed, parallel-group, non-blinded, pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) design (trial registration: ANZCTR12620001276943). Sixty-one families of autistic children without intellectual disability (5-12 years, 46% female) with caregiver-reported moderate-severe behavioural sleep problems participated Australia-wide, randomised to an intervention (n = 30) or treatment as usual control group (n = 31). Intervention group participants were invited to attend two video-conference telehealth sessions and one follow-up phone call with a trained clinician. Survey data was collected from caregivers at baseline and three- and six-months post-randomisation, to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy. Ten intervention group caregivers participated in end-of-study semi-structured interviews to explore their experiences. Forty-nine caregivers completed surveys. At baseline, 87% felt positive and 84% felt confident about participating via telehealth, and 75% believed the program would improve child sleep. At three-months, intervention group caregivers (n = 24) reported the usefulness (100%) of and preference for (71%) telehealth, and 95.8% would recommend this sleep program to other families. A significant group by time difference was observed in child sleep (Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire) with large effect sizes (d = 0.87-1.05), emotion and behaviour (Developmental Behavior Checklist 2) with moderate effect sizes (d = 0.40-0.57), and caregiver mental health (Kessler 10) with small to moderate effect sizes (d = 0.60-0.28), favouring the intervention group (n = 23). There were no significant group differences in child (Child Health Utility instrument) or caregiver (Assessment of Quality of Life) quality of life. However, there were individual differences in the clinical significance of improved child sleep. Qualitative data showed that whilst telehealth was convenient for caregivers, without attenuating the benefits of most key intervention features, not all children were able to engage effectively with the clinician via telehealth. This first pilot RCT of a brief telehealth behavioural sleep intervention for primary-school-aged autistic children suggests that telehealth delivery is acceptable, feasible and likely efficacious in improving sleep in the short-term. Providing families with ongoing choice of mode of delivery (telehealth/in-person) and examining the person-environment fit of telehealth for autistic children is important.","Humans, Female, Male, Telemedicine, Pilot Projects, Child, Caregivers, Child, Preschool, Autistic Disorder, Australia, Sleep Wake Disorders, Surveys and Questionnaires, Behavior Therapy","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39306958","Royal Children's Hospital, 50 Flemington Road, Parkville, Victoria, 3052, Australia.; Monash Krongold Clinic, Faculty of Education, Monash University, Wellington Road, Clayton, Victoria, 3168, Australia; School of Psychological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Nursing, and Health Sciences, Monash University, 18 Innovation Walk, Clayton, Victoria, 3800, Australia.; School of Educational Psychology and Counselling, Faculty of Education, Monash University, 19 Ancora Imparo Way, Clayton, Victoria, 3800, Australia; School of Psychological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Nursing, and Health Sciences, Monash University, 18 Innovation Walk, Clayton, Victoria, 3800, Australia.; Murdoch Children's Research Institute, 50 Flemington Road, Parkville, Victoria, 3052, Australia; Department of Paediatrics, University of Melbourne, Grattan Street, Parkville, Victoria, 3010, Australia; Royal Children's Hospital, 50 Flemington Road, Parkville, Victoria, 3052, Australia.; The Kids Research Institute Australia, The University of Western Australia, Nedlands, Western Australia, 6007, Australia.; School of Educational Psychology and Counselling, Faculty of Education, Monash University, 19 Ancora Imparo Way, Clayton, Victoria, 3800, Australia; Monash Krongold Clinic, Faculty of Education, Monash University, Wellington Road, Clayton, Victoria, 3168, Australia.; School of Educational Psychology and Counselling, Faculty of Education, Monash University, 19 Ancora Imparo Way, Clayton, Victoria, 3800, Australia; Monash Krongold Clinic, Faculty of Education, Monash University, Wellington Road, Clayton, Victoria, 3168, Australia; School of Psychological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Nursing, and Health Sciences, Monash University, 18 Innovation Walk, Clayton, Victoria, 3800, Australia.

"39248107","Neurophysiological effects of a combined treatment of lovastatin and minocycline in patients with fragile X syndrome: Ancillary results of the LOVAMIX randomized clinical trial.","2024-09-01","Morin-Parent Florence, Champigny Camille, Côté Samantha, Mohamad Teddy, Hasani Seyede Anis, Çaku Artuela, Corbin François, Lepage Jean-François","Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research","Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the primary hereditary cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. It is characterized by exacerbated neuronal excitability, and its correction is considered an objective measure of treatment response in animal models, a marker albeit rarely used in clinical trials. Here, we used an extensive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) battery to assess the neurophysiological effects of a therapy combining two disease-modifying drugs, lovastatin (40 mg) and minocycline (100 mg), administered alone for 8 weeks and in combination for 12 weeks, in 19 patients (mean age of 23.58 ± 1.51) with FXS taking part in the LOVAmix trial. The TMS battery, which included the resting motor threshold, short-interval intracortical inhibition, long-interval intracortical inhibition, corticospinal silent period, and intracortical facilitation, was completed at baseline after 8 weeks of monotherapy (visit 2 of the clinical trial) and after 12 weeks of dual therapy (visit 4 of the clinical trial). Repeated measure ANOVAs were performed between baseline and visit 2 (monotherapy) and visit 3 (dual therapy) with interactions for which monotherapy the participants received when they began the clinical trial. Results showed that dual therapy was associated with reduced cortical excitability after 20 weeks. This was reflected by a significant increase in the resting-motor threshold after dual therapy compared to baseline. There was a tendency for enhanced short-intracortical inhibition, a marker of GABAa-mediated inhibition after 8 weeks of monotherapy compared to baseline. Together, these results suggest that a combined therapy of minocycline and lovastatin might act on the core neurophysiopathology of FXS. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02680379).","Humans, Lovastatin, Fragile X Syndrome, Minocycline, Male, Female, Young Adult, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Adult, Drug Therapy,

"37963634","Autism intervention meta-analysis of early childhood studies (Project AIM): updated systematic review and secondary analysis.","2023-11-14","Sandbank Micheal, Bottema-Beutel Kristen, Crowley LaPoint Shannon, Feldman Jacob I, Barrett D Jonah, Caldwell Nicolette, Dunham Kacie, Crank Jenna, Albarran Suzanne, Woynaroski Tiffany","BMJ (Clinical research ed.)","To summarize the breadth and quality of evidence supporting commonly recommended early childhood autism interventions and their estimated effects on developmental outcomes. Updated systematic review and meta-analysis (autism intervention meta-analysis; Project AIM). A search was conducted in November 2021 (updating a search done in November 2017) of the following databases and registers: Academic Search Complete, CINAHL Plus with full text, Education Source, Educational Administration Abstracts, ERIC, Medline, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, PsycINFO, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, and SocINDEX with full text, <i>Trials</i>, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Any controlled group study testing the effects of any non-pharmacological intervention on any outcome in young autistic children younger than 8 years. Newly identified studies were integrated into the previous dataset and were coded for participant, intervention, and outcome characteristics. Interventions were categorized by type of approach (such as behavioral, developmental, naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention, and technology based), and outcomes were categorized by domain (such as social communication, adaptive behavior, play, and language). Risks of bias were evaluated following guidance from Cochrane. Effects were estimated for all intervention and outcome types with sufficient contributing data, stratified by risk of bias, using robust variance estimation to account for intercorrelation of effects within studies and subgroups. The search yielded 289 reports of 252 studies, representing 13 304 participants and effects for 3291 outcomes. When contributing effects were restricted to those from randomized controlled trials, significant summary effects were estimated for behavioral interventions on social emotional or challenging behavior outcomes (Hedges' g=0.58, 95% confidence interval 0.11 to 1.06; P=0.02), developmental interventions on social communication (0.28, 0.12 to 0.44; P=0.003); naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions on adaptive behavior (0.23, 0.02 to 0.43; P=0.03), language (0.16, 0.01 to 0.31; P=0.04), play (0.19, 0.02 to 0.36; P=0.03), social communication (0.35, 0.23 to 0.47; P<0.001), and measures of diagnostic characteristics of autism (0.38, 0.17 to 0.59; P=0.002); and technology based interventions on social communication (0.33, 0.02 to 0.64; P=0.04) and social emotional or challenging behavior outcomes (0.57, 0.04 to 1.09; P=0.04). When effects were further restricted to exclude caregiver or teacher report outcomes, significant effects were estimated only for developmental interventions on social communication (0.31, 0.13 to 0.49; P=0.003) and naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions on social communication (0.36, 0.23 to 0.49; P<0.001) and measures of diagnostic characteristics of autism (0.44, 0.20 to 0.68; P=0.002). When effects were then restricted to exclude those at high risk of detection bias, only one significant summary effect was estimated-naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions on measures of diagnostic characteristics of autism (0.30, 0.03 to 0.57; P=0.03). Adverse events were poorly monitored, but possibly common. The available evidence on interventions to support young autistic children has approximately doubled in four years. Some evidence from randomized controlled trials shows that behavioral interventions improve caregiver perception of challenging behavior and child social emotional functioning, and that technology based interventions support proximal improvements in specific social communication and social emotional skills. Evidence also shows that developmental interventions improve social communication in interactions with caregivers, and naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions improve core challenges associated with autism, particularly difficulties with social communication. However, potential benefits of these interventions cannot be weighed against the potential for adverse effects owing to inadequate monitoring and reporting.","Child, Humans, Child, Preschool, Autistic

"37943121","The devil is in the details: Advancing our collective understanding of naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions.","2024-01-01","Shire Stephanie","Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research","Given the growing body of randomized trials examining various Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Intervention (NDBI) approaches, a dialog has emerged exploring the overlap in strategies across NDBIs to create single measures that propose to capture core strategies across the interventions. This commentary will ask readers to consider the current state of the science, the potential value of looking not only for similarities but also for differences across approaches, and present five scientific next steps to advance our collective understanding of the NDBIs including: (a) operationalizing intervention strategies and outcomes, (b) expansion of the effectiveness evidence base and begin testing implementation strategies for individual NDBIs, (c) rigorous testing of core intervention components and the mechanism of each intervention, (d) personalization, and (e) supporting

"37703248","The mechanism and effectiveness of mindfulness-based intervention for reducing the psychological distress of parents of children with autism spectrum disorder: A protocol of randomized control trial of ecological momentary intervention and assessment.","2023-01-01","Wang Qi, Ng Siu-Man, Zhou Xiaochen","PloS one","Existing studies have unequivocally demonstrated that parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience various stressful daily life events and suffer from psychological distress. Mindfulness level is found to be an effective buffer between parents' appraisal of stress life events and psychological distress. However, the mechanism behind the function of mindfulness is unclear, and traditional mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) in experimental settings is not tailored to personal real-life needs. This study proposes to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the effectiveness of MBI delivered by ecological momentary intervention (EMI) and assessed by ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in changing participants' cognitive appraisal of stressful life events and thus reducing the psychological distress of parents of children with ASD. The proposed study will recruit 670 parents of children with ASD and randomly assign them to the intervention and control groups (335 in each group). Participants in the intervention group will install the EMI/A app on their smartphones. In the app, participants can receive practice prompts daily, browse and practice different mindfulness exercises in the intervention library at any time, talk to a virtual counselor (chatbot) when feeling stressed, complete EMA on the cognitive appraisal of life events, and receive the log of change of psychological status daily. Participants in the control group will only receive audio-based standardized mindfulness practice instructions three times per week. The effects of MBI will be assessed based on the EMA data, right after the intervention and at the 2-month follow-up. The primary outcome will be participants' psychological distress measured by the depression anxiety stress scale. The secondary outcomes will include participants' subjective well-being, measured by the satisfaction with life scale, and level of resilience, measured by the psychological empowerment scale. Multilevel structural equational modelling will be applied to examine the pathways of the relationship between daily life events, cognitive appraisal, and psychological distress. The potential benefit of the proposed study is to increase the psychological well-being of parents of children with ASD, and the method may extend to participants suffering from other psychological issues in the future. Trial registration: This trial has been registered on clinicaltrials.gov with the ID of NCT05746468.","Humans, Child, Mindfulness, Psychological Distress, Emotions, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Parents,

We examined whether a combination of the Awareness and Care for My Autistic Traits (ACAT) program and treatment-as-usual is more effective than only treatment-as-usual in increasing the understanding of autistic attributes, reducing treatment stigma, and improving mental health and social adaptation among autistic adolescents and their parents/guardians. Forty-nine adolescents and their parents/guardians were randomly assigned to either a combination of ACAT and treatment-as-usual or only treatment-as-usual. The combined group received six weekly 100-minute ACAT sessions, while the treatment-as-usual group received no additional intervention. The primary outcome was the change in understanding of autistic attributes (Autism Knowledge Quiz-Child), administered from pre- to post-intervention. The secondary outcomes included the change in Autism Knowledge Quiz-Parent, reduced treatment stigma, and improved mental health and social adaptation among autistic adolescents and their parents/guardians. A primary outcome measure scale was scored by assessors who were blind to the group assignment. The combined group (both autistic adolescents and their parents/guardians) showed an increase in Autism Knowledge Quiz scores compared to those in the treatment-as-usual group. Autistic adolescents in the combined group also demonstrated a decrease in treatment-related stigma and an improvement in general mental health compared to those in the treatment-as-usual group, while there were no group differences in the change in social adaptation. For parents/guardians, there were no group differences in the change in treatment-related stigma, general mental health, adaptive skills, or attitudes toward their children. The ACAT program could be an effective treatment modality to increase the understanding of autistic attributes among both autistic adolescents and their parents/guardians. The ACAT program positively affects self-understanding, reduces treatment stigma, and stabilizes behavioral issues for autistic adolescents as a part of mental health measures, but it does not effectively reduce treatment barriers or improve mental health for parents/guardians. Further research should consider whether additional support for parents/guardians could be beneficial. The study was registered in UMIN (UMIN000029851, 06/01/2018).","Humans, Adolescent, Autistic Disorder, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Communication, Mental Health,

"37616029","Effects of a Nonwearable Digital Therapeutic Intervention on Preschoolers With Autism Spectrum Disorder in China: Open-Label Randomized Controlled Trial.","2023-08-24","Chu Liting, Shen Li, Ma Chenhuan, Chen Jinjin, Tian Yuan, Zhang Chuncao, Gong Zilan, Li Mengfan, Wang Chengjie, Pan Lizhu, Zhu Peiying, Wu Danmai, Wang Yu, Yu Guangjun","Journal of medical Internet research","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that can cause difficulty with communication and social interactions as well as complicated family dynamics. Digital health interventions can reduce treatment costs and promote healthy lifestyle changes. These therapies can be adjunctive or replace traditional treatments. However, issues with cooperation and compliance prevent preschool patients with ASD from applying these tools. In this open-label, randomized controlled trial, we developed a nonwearable digital therapy called virtual reality-incorporated cognitive behavioral therapy (VR-CBT). The aim of this study was to assess the adjunctive function of VR-CBT by comparing the effects of VR-CBT plus learning style profile (LSP) intervention with those of LSP-only intervention in preschool children with ASD. This trial was performed in China on 78 preschool children (age 3-6 years, IQ>70) diagnosed with ASD who were randomized to receive a 20-week VR-CBT plus LSP intervention (intervention group, 39/78, 50%) or LSP intervention only (control group, 39/78, 50%). The primary outcome was the change of scores from baseline to week 20, assessed by using the parent-rated Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC). Secondary outcomes included the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS-IV), and behavioral performance data (accuracy and reaction time) in go/no-go tasks. All primary and secondary outcomes were analyzed in the intention-to-treat population. After the intervention, there was an intervention effect on total ABC (β=-5.528; P<.001) and CARS scores (β=-1.365; P=.02). A similar trend was observed in the ABC subscales: sensory (β=-1.133; P=.047), relating (β=-1.512; P=.03), body and object use (β=-1.211; P=.03), and social and self-help (β=-1.593; P=.03). The intervention also showed statistically significant effects in improving behavioral performance (go/no-go task, accuracy, β=2.923; P=.04). Moreover, a significant improvement of ADHD hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms was observed in 53 children with comorbid ADHD based on ADHD-RS-IV (β=-1.269; P=.02). No statistically significant intervention effect was detected in the language subscale of ABC (β=-.080; P=.83). Intervention group girls had larger improvements in ABC subscales, that is, sensory and body and object use and in the CARS score and accuracy of go/no-go task (all P<.05) than the control group girls. Statistically significant intervention effects could be observed in hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms in the intervention group boys with comorbid ADHD compared with those in the control group boys (β=-1.333; P=.03). We found potentially positive effects of nonwearable digital therapy plus LSP on core symptoms associated with ASD, leading to a modest improvement in the function of sensory, motor, and response inhibition, while reducing impulsivity and hyperactivity in preschoolers with both ASD and ADHD. VR-CBT was found to be an effective and feasible adjunctive digital tool.

"37061694","VR-SOAP, a modular virtual reality treatment for improving social activities and participation of young people with psychosis: a study protocol for a single-blind multi-centre randomized controlled trial.","2023-04-15","Meins Ivo Alexander, Muijsson-Bouwman Dauw Catharina, Nijman Saskia Anne, Greaves-Lord Kirstin, Veling Wim, Pijnenborg Gerdina Hendrika Maria, van der Stouwe Elisabeth Christine Dorothée","Trials","Young people with a psychotic disorder have the same social goals as their healthy peers, but their social networks are smaller, they participate less often in leisure activities and are less successful in work and education. Causes of these problems are multifaceted, but culminate in difficulties with interacting in daily life social situations. Current treatments have only moderate effects on social functioning and often target one specific domain. Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to improve the treatment of social interaction difficulties. We developed a modular VR treatment for social functioning and participation (VR-SOAP). In this study, the effect of this intervention will be investigated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). A total of 116 participants (age 18-40) with a DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorder and problems with social functioning will be recruited from mental healthcare institutes in the Netherlands. Participants will be randomized to the experimental condition (VR-SOAP) or active VR control condition (VRelax). VR-SOAP consists of 14 sessions and 5 modules addressing causes of impaired social functioning: four optional modules (1-4) and one fixed module (5). Vrelax consists of 14 sessions that entail psychoeducation, stress management, relaxation techniques, and the exploration of relaxing environments in VR. Primary outcomes are quantity and quality of social contacts, leisure activities and social participation, measured with the experience sampling method (ESM). Secondary outcomes are psychiatric symptoms, social behaviour, social cognition, self-esteem, self-stigma and paranoid thoughts. Treatment effects will be compared at pre-treatment (baseline), post-treatment and at 6-month follow-up. If VR-SOAP proves to be effective, it provides therapists with a much-needed tool to improve social functioning of young adults with a psychotic disorder. Additionally, since the treatment consists of multiple modules targeting different transdiagnostic factors, this trial might provide input for new treatments to improve social functioning in a range of symptoms and disorders, e.g. mood, autism spectrum and anxiety disorders. On the 10th of November 2021, this trial was registered prospectively in the Dutch Trial Register as NL9784 .","Young Adult, Humans, Adolescent, Adult, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Treatment Outcome,

We randomly assigned adults with ASD to MBSR or social support/education (SE). They completed questionnaires that assessed depression, anxiety, mindfulness traits, autistic traits and executive functioning abilities as well as a self-reflection functional MRI task. We used repeated-measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to evaluate behavioural changes. To identify task-specific connectivity changes, we performed a generalized psychophysiological interactions (gPPI) functional connectivity (FC) analysis on regions of interest (ROIs; insula, amygdala, cingulum and prefrontal cortex [PFC]). We used Pearson correlations to explore brain-behaviour relationships. Our final sample included 78 adults with ASD - 39 who received MBSR and 39 who received SE. Mindfulness-based stress reduction uniquely improved executive functioning abilities and increased mindfulness traits, whereas both MBSR and SE groups showed reductions in depression, anxiety and autistic traits. Decreases specific to MBSR in insula-thalamus FC were associated with anxiety reduction and increased mindfulness traits, including the trait ""nonjudgment;"" MBSR-specific decreases in PFC-posterior cingulate connectivity correlated with improved working memory. Both groups showed decreased amygdala-sensorimotor and medial-lateral PFC connectivity, which corresponded with reduced depression. Larger sample sizes and neuropsychological evaluations are needed to replicate and extend these findings. Together, our findings suggest that MBSR and SE are similarly efficacious for depression, anxiety and autistic traits, whereas MBSR produced additional salutary effects related to executive functioning and mindfulness traits. Findings from gPPI identified shared and distinct therapeutic neural mechanisms, implicating the default mode and salience networks. Our results mark an early step toward the development of personalized medicine for psychiatric symptoms in ASD and offer novel neural targets for future neurostimulation research.

"35501967","Citalopram Did Not Significantly Improve Anxiety in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder Undergoing Treatment for Core Symptoms: Secondary Analysis of a Trial to Reduce Repetitive Behaviors.","2022-05-01","Simonoff Emily, Mowlem Florence, Pearson Oliver, Anagnostou Evdokia, Donnelly Craig, Hollander Eric, King Bryan H, McCracken James T, Scahill Lawrence, Sikich Linmarie, Pickles Andrew","Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology","<b><i>Objective:</i></b> Anxiety disorders are among the most common co-occurring conditions in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Despite their prevalence and impact, there are no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed at evaluating the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for anxiolysis in this population, who may have a different biological basis for anxiety. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Secondary analyses of the STAART double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT of citalopram in children with ASD examined whether citalopram reduced anxiety measured on the parent-reported Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory-4 (CASI-4) as the primary outcome. An intention-to-treat analysis involving all 149 participants used multiple imputations for missing data and included baseline stratification factors of age group and site, among others. We prespecified as clinically significant a 33% reduction in anxiety in citalopram versus placebo, coinciding with 80% power. We tested whether communicative ability on the Vineland Communication score moderated treatment effect and explored whether initial anxiety was associated with greater adverse events, which could impact on dose titration and achieving optimal dose. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Both groups showed substantial reduction in anxiety. Citalopram was associated with a nonsignificant 16.5% greater reduction (observed coefficient = -0.181, bootstrap standard error = 0.126, <i>p</i> = 0.151, confidence interval = -0.428 to 0.066). Anxiety reports were significantly lower in children with reduced communicative ability, but communicative ability did not moderate the treatment effect (interaction <i>p</i> = 0.294). Initial anxiety levels were not associated with increased adverse effects (interaction <i>p</i>s 0.162-0.954). <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Citalopram did not statistically significantly improve anxiety in children with ASD. Clinicians should be cautious in their use of SSRIs for this indication. There remains a need for well-powered clinical trials testing the efficacy of SSRIs among autistic children with anxiety disorders.","Adolescent, Anxiety, Anxiety Disorders, Autism Spectrum Disorder,

"36510817","Acceptance and commitment therapy for autistic adults: A randomized controlled pilot study in a psychiatric outpatient setting.","2023-07-01","Pahnke Johan, Jansson-Fröjmark Markus, Andersson Gerhard, Bjureberg Johan, Jokinen Jussi, Bohman Benjamin, Lundgren Tobias","Autism : the international journal of research and practice","Autistic adults are often stressed and feel depressed or anxious. However, mental health programs that are suited for autistic adults are few. Acceptance and commitment therapy is a psychotherapy method that seems to help people feel better, although not thoroughly evaluated in autistic individuals. In this study, 20 autistic adults had 14 weeks of acceptance and commitment therapy group treatment suited for autism (NeuroACT), while 19 autistic adults had ordinary care. The acceptance and commitment therapy group treatment program seemed logical and reasonable to the participants. Also, when comparing the participants in the NeuroACT group with those in the ordinary care group, the NeuroACT participants reported less stress and higher quality of life. Compared to the ordinary care group, they could also manage distressing thoughts better, perceived themselves as more flexible, and did not avoid stressful situations as much as before. However, there was no significant difference between the groups in depression, anxiety, sleep problems, social aspects of autism, everyday functioning, or executive challenges. Slightly more NeuroACT participants did not finish the treatment than ordinary care participants. In conclusion, the NeuroACT program may be a treatment for autistic adults who feel stressed and have reduced quality of life.

"36417403","Preliminary efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy on emotion regulation in adults with autism spectrum disorder: A pilot randomized waitlist-controlled study.","2022-01-01","Kuroda Miho, Kawakubo Yuki, Kamio Yoko, Yamasue Hidenori, Kono Toshiaki, Nonaka Maiko, Matsuda Natsumi, Kataoka Muneko, Wakabayashi Akio, Yokoyama Kazuhito, Kano Yukiko, Kuwabara Hitoshi","PloS one","Previous studies have demonstrated the clinical utility of cognitive-behavioral therapy in improving emotion regulation in children on the autism spectrum. However, no studies have elucidated the clinical utility of cognitive-behavioral therapy in improving emotion regulation in autistic adults. The aim of the present pilot study was to explore the preliminary clinical utility of a group-based cognitive-behavioral therapy program designed to address emotion regulation skills in autistic adults. We conducted a clinical trial based on a previously reported protocol; 31 participants were randomly allocated to the intervention group and 29 to the waitlist control group. The intervention group underwent an 8-week program of cognitive-behavioral therapy sessions. Two participants from the intervention group withdrew from the study, leaving 29 participants (93.5%) in the group. Compared with the waitlist group, the cognitive-behavioral therapy group exhibited significantly greater pre-to-post (Week 0-8) intervention score improvements on the attitude scale of the autism spectrum disorder knowledge and attitude quiz (t = 2.21, p = 0.03, d = 0.59) and the difficulty describing feelings scale of the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (t = -2.07, p = 0.04, d = -0.57) in addition to pre-to-follow-up (Week 0-16) score improvements on the emotion-oriented scale of the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (t = -2.14, p = 0.04, d = -0.59). Our study thus provides preliminary evidence of the efficacy of the group-based cognitive-behavioral therapy program on emotion regulation in autistic adults, thereby supporting further evaluation of the effectiveness of the cognitive-behavioral therapy program in the context of a larger randomized clinical trial. However, the modest and inconsistent effects underscore the importance of continued efforts to improve the cognitive-behavioral therapy program beyond current standards.","Child, Adult, Humans, Autism

"36245883","Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for insomnia in patients with autism spectrum disorder: Study protocol for a randomized, double-blind, and sham-controlled clinical trial.","2022-01-01","Jiao Jian, Tan Lu, Zhang Ye, Li Taomei, Tang Xiangdong","Frontiers in psychiatry","Insomnia is the most common comorbidity in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and seriously affects their rehabilitation and prognosis. Thus, an intervention targeting insomnia in ASD seems warranted. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a potentially effective treatment for improving sleep quality and optimizing sleep structure, has already been demonstrated to alleviate insomnia symptoms and sleep disturbance in different neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions. This trial aims to investigate the effects of rTMS on insomnia in patients with ASD. This study is designed to be a double-blind, randomized, and sham-controlled trial with a target sample size of 30 participants (aged 3-13 years) diagnosed with ASD comorbid with insomnia. The intervention phase will comprise 20 sessions of rTMS or sham rTMS applied over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) within four consecutive weeks. The effect of rTMS on insomnia and other symptoms of ASD will be investigated through home-PSG (two consecutive overnights), sleep diary, CSHQ, CARS, ABC, SRS, RBS-R, and metabolomics analysis at baseline and posttreatment. A follow-up assessment 1 month after the intervention will examine the long-term effects. The results of this study may address an important knowledge gap and may provide evidence for the use of rTMS to treat insomnia in ASD. Furthermore, it will elucidate the potential mechanism and link between sleep disorders and clinical symptoms.

"39056514","Applications and efficacy of radically open dialectical behavior therapy (RO DBT): A systematic review of the literature.","2024-11-01","Hatoum Amaani H, Burton Amy L","Journal of clinical psychology","Radically open dialectical behaviour therapy (RO DBT) is a transdiagnostic treatment, originally developed as a variant of dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT), that emerged as a novel treatment approach for those presenting with excessive or maladaptive overcontrol. Despite RO DBT's growing popularity among clinicians as a treatment for chronic depression, personality disorders and eating disorders, to date, no systematic review has been conducted to summarise the evidence on this therapy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to systematically review the literature to provide a current and comprehensive summary of the available evidence on the clinical applications and efficacy of RO DBT. Articles were included if they were original research studies that described the use of RO DBT in the treatment of any psychological disorder, condition or symptom, published in the English language in a peer-reviewed journal. Four electronic databases were searched, and screening, selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction were all conducted by two independent reviewers. Fourteen articles were included in this review, including two qualitative articles, one case study, five case series studies, four quasi-experimental studies, and two articles describing one randomized control trial. Findings indicated there is emerging evidence for the use of RO DBT in both adolescents and adults, for disorders characterized by excessive self-control, such as anorexia nervosa and autism, as well as for treatment-resistant depression. While RO DBT shows promise as a treatment for disorders of overcontrol, further research is needed.

Some studies have shown that substances derived from Cannabis sativa improve the quality of life of children with ASD without causing serious adverse effects, thus providing an alternative therapeutic option. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a cannabis extract rich in cannabidiol (CBD) in children with ASD. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 60 children, aged from 5 to 11 years, were selected and divided into two groups: the treatment group, which received the CBD-rich cannabis extract, and the control group, which received the placebo. They both used their respective products for a period of 12 weeks. Statistical analysis was done by two-factor mixed analysis of variance (two-way ANOVA). Significant results were found for social interaction (F1,116 = 14.13, p = 0.0002), anxiety (F1,116 = 5.99, p = 0.016), psychomotor agitation (F1,116 = 9.22, p = 0.003), number of meals a day (F1,116 = 4.11, p = 0.04), and concentration (F1,48 = 6.75, p = 0.01), the last of which was only significant in mild ASD cases. Regarding safety, it was found that only three children in the treatment group (9.7%) had adverse effects, namely dizziness, insomnia, colic, and weight gain. CBD-rich cannabis extract was found to improve one of the diagnostic criteria for ASD (social interaction), as well as features that often co-exist with ASD, and to have few serious adverse effects.","Child, Humans, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Cannabidiol, Cannabis, Double-Blind Method, Plant Extracts, Quality of Life, Child, Preschool","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35617670","Departamento de Fonoaudiologia, UFPB, João Pessoa, PB, Brazil.; Departamento de Estatística, UFPB, João Pessoa, PB, Brazil.; Programa de Pós-Graduação em Neurociência Cognitiva e Comportamento, Departamento de Psicologia, Universidade Federal da Paraíba (UFPB), João Pessoa, PB, Brazil.; Sociedade Brasileira de Estudos da Cannabis Sativa (SBEC), São Paulo, SP, Brazil.; Sociedade Brasileira de Estudos da Cannabis Sativa (SBEC), São Paulo, SP, Brazil.

"35582893","Early intervention for very young children with or at high likelihood for autism spectrum disorder: An overview of reviews.","2022-09-01","Franz Lauren, Goodwin Cara D, Rieder Amber, Matheis Maya, Damiano Diane L","Developmental medicine and child neurology","To identify which interventions are supported by evidence and the quality of that evidence in very young children with or at high likelihood for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to improve child outcomes. We conducted an overview of reviews to synthesize early intervention literature for very young children with or at high likelihood for ASD. Cochrane guidance on how to perform overviews of reviews was followed. Comprehensive searches of databases were conducted for systematic reviews and meta-analyses between January 2009 and December 2020. Review data were extracted and summarized and methodological quality was assessed. Primary randomized controlled trial evidence was summarized and risk of bias assessed. This overview of reviews was not registered. From 762 records, 78 full texts were reviewed and seven systematic reviews and meta-analyses with 63 unique studies were identified. Several interventional approaches (naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention, and developmental and behavioral interventions) improved child developmental outcomes. Heterogeneity in design, intervention and control group, dose, delivery agent, and measurement approach was noted. Inconsistent methodological quality and potential biases were identified. While many early interventional approaches have an impact on child outcomes, study heterogeneity and quality had an impact on our ability to draw firm conclusions regarding which treatments are most effective. Advances in trial methodology and design, and increasing attention to mitigating measurement bias, will advance the quality of the ASD early intervention evidence base. Naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions, as well as developmental and behavioral interventions, improve child outcomes in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). If only randomized controlled trials are considered, guidelines for early intensive behavioral intervention in younger children should be revisited. The greatest intervention impacts were on proximal, intervention-specific outcomes. Inadequacies in the quality of the early ASD intervention evidence base were observed.","Autism Spectrum Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Child, Child Development, Child, Preschool, Early Intervention,

"38816827","Utility of a virtual small group cognitive behaviour program for autistic children during the pandemic: evidence from a community-based implementation study.","2024-05-30","Lee Vivian, Vashi Nisha, Roudbarani Flora, Modica Paula Tablon, Pouyandeh Ava, Sellitto Teresa, Ibrahim Alaa, Ameis Stephanie H, Elkader Alex, Gray Kylie M, Kerns Connor M, Lai Meng-Chuan, Lake Johanna, Thomson Kendra, Weiss Jonathan A","BMC health services research","Autistic children often experience socioemotional difficulties relating to emotion regulation and mental health problems. Supports for autistic children involve the use of adapted interventions that target emotion regulation and social skills, alongside mental health symptoms. The Secret Agent Society Small Group (SAS: SG), an adapted cognitive behavioural program, has demonstrated efficacy through lab-delivered randomized control trials. However, research is still needed on its effectiveness when delivered by publicly funded, community-based autism providers under real-world ecologically valid conditions, especially within the context of a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted access to community-based supports and services for autistic children, and programs have adapted their services to online platforms. However, questions remain about the feasibility and clinical utility of evidence-based interventions and services delivered virtually in community-based settings. The 9-week SAS: SG program was delivered virtually by seven community-based autism service providers during 2020-2021. The program included the use of computer-based games, role-playing tasks, and home missions. Caregivers completed surveys at three timepoints: pre-, post-intervention, and after a 3-month follow-up session. Surveys assessed caregivers' perception of the program's acceptability and level of satisfaction, as well as their child's social and emotional regulation skills and related mental health challenges. A total of 77 caregivers (94% gender identity females; Mean = 42.1 years, SD = 6.5 years) and their children (79% gender identity males; Mean = 9.9 years, SD = 1.3 years) completed the SAS: SG program. Caregivers agreed that the program was acceptable (95%) and were highly satisfied (90%). Caregivers reported significant reduction in their child's emotion reactivity from pre- to post-intervention (-1.78 (95% CI, -3.20 to -0.29), p = 0.01, d = 0.36), that continued to decrease after the 3-month booster session (-1.75 (95% CI, -3.34 to -0.16), p = 0.02, d = 0.33). Similarly, improvements in anxiety symptoms were observed (3.05 (95% CI, 0.72 to 5.36), p = 0.006, d = 0.39). As online delivery of interventions for autistic children remains popular past the pandemic, our findings shed light on future considerations for community-based services, including therapists and agency leaders, on how best to tailor and optimally deliver virtually based programming. This study has been registered with ISRCTN Registry (ISRCTN98068608) on 15/09/2023.

"39989401","Parent Outcomes from a Randomized Controlled Trial Investigating a Modular Behavioral Intervention for Young Autistic Children.","2025-03-01","Levato Lynne, Hochheimer Samantha, Wang Hongyue, Wallace Lisa, Hyman Susan, Anderson Cynthia, Warren Zachary, Butter Eric, Martin Ryan, Lee Evon, Smith Tristram, Johnson Cynthia","Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research","We assessed parent stress and competence outcomes from participation in a randomized controlled trial of a modular behavioral intervention (Modular Approach for Young Autistic Children; MAYAC) compared to a treatment-as-usual comprehensive behavioral intervention (CBI). Throughout their participation, parents of military families were included in their child's treatment (e.g., identifying goals, learning strategies to support their child) and reported on their feelings of stress using the Parenting Stress Index-4, Short Form (PSI-4), as well as their feelings of satisfaction and efficacy as a parent on the Parenting Sense of Competence (PSOC) scale. A linear mixed model evaluated the differences in stress and competence from baseline to each assessment period through follow-up. There were no significant differences between groups in stress or competence ratings; however, there were within-group changes in both treatment arms over the course of the trial. In both groups, parent stress decreased, and competence increased over time, continuing to suggest that behavioral analytic intervention for young children with autism can promote positive parent outcomes.

"39960783","Glutathione, Vitamin C, and Cysteine Use in Autistic Children With Disruptive Behavior: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Crossover Pilot Study.",,"Williams Patricia Gail, Sears Lonnie, Watson Walter H, Gunaratnam Bakeerathan, Feygin Yana, Wright Stephen P, Sullivan Janice E","Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by social communication differences and restricted interests. One proposed biologic mechanism underlying ASD is oxidative stress, leading to the clinical use of glutathione based on anecdotal reports of improved behavior in autistic children. In this pilot study, we tested this observation using a randomized clinical trial format to collect preliminary data on glutathione safety and efficacy. Glutathione and glutathione in combination with vitamin C and N-acetylcysteine (Trio) were tested. Both treatments were administered in double-blind placebo-controlled randomized crossover studies. In total, 24 children between the ages of 5 and 16 years with ASD and severe behavior disorders were randomized to receive weekly intravenous injections of either placebo or 1 of the 2 interventions (glutathione or Trio) for 8 weeks. After a 1-week washout period, participants were crossed over for the subsequent 8 weeks. Behavioral measures and plasma levels of glutathione were obtained at baseline, during the washout period, and at the end of the study. No differences between treatment groups in behavioral or biologic measures were found. No significant adverse side effects attributable to the treatments were observed. Small improvements in specific glutathione and behavioral measures occurred over the study period for all groups. Treatment with glutathione or glutathione in combination with vitamin C and N-acetylcysteine did not result in improvements in behavior or biologic measures. The positive trends over the course of the study were likely due to the placebo effect or decreased anxiety associated with the study routine.","Humans, Child, Ascorbic Acid, Pilot Projects,

"39937336","Cerebellar Neuromodulation in Autism Spectrum Disorders and Social Cognition: Insights from Animal and Human Studies.","2025-02-12","Elandaloussi Yannis, Dufrenne Océane, Lefebvre Aline, Houenou Josselin, Senova Suhan, Laidi Charles","Cerebellum (London, England)","Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by social atypicalities and repetitive behaviors. Growing evidence suggests that alterations in brain networks may contribute to ASD symptoms. The cerebellum, with its widespread connections to the cortex, has emerged as a potential key player in ASD. Non-invasive neuromodulation techniques, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) offer a promising avenue for modulating brain activity and potentially alleviating ASD symptoms. In addition, preclinical studies in rodents further emphasize the therapeutic effect of cerebellar stimulation to target autism-related symptoms. This article reviews both clinical and preclinical studies aiming to modulate cerebellar circuits to improve symptoms of ASD. We found ten relevant studies assessing the effect of cerebellar neuromodulation in human and preclinical models. Posterior cerebellar tDCS represented the most frequent neuromodulation method and suggested that cerebellar tDCS can lead to improvements in symptoms of ASD and restore cerebellar connectivity in individuals with ASD. In neurotypical participants, there is evidence that cerebellar tDCS can enhance social cognitive abilities. These results are in line with preclinical studies, suggesting that chemogenetic stimulation can modulate cerebellar circuits involved in ASD and improve related behaviors. Further research is needed to establish standardized protocols, assess long-term effects, and investigate the underlying mechanisms of cerebellar stimulation. We examine research questions that need to be addressed before launching large scale randomized clinical trials.","Autism Spectrum Disorder, Humans, Cerebellum, Animals, Transcranial Direct Current

"39729835","Behavioral therapies for the treatment of autism spectrum disorder: A systematic review.","2025-01-01","Santos Clara Lucato Dos, Barreto Indyanara Inacio, Silva Ana Carolina Furian da, Soriano Juliana Firmino Batista, Castro Jeferson de Lima Silva, Tristão Luca Schiliró, Bernardo Wanderley Marques","Clinics (Sao Paulo, Brazil)","Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopment spectrum characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interpersonal interaction, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, interest, or activities. The appropriate screening and diagnosis must be realized to improve the children's prognosis. Moreover, appropriate treatments are necessary to promote better social integration and development. In this scenario, this systematic review aims to evaluate the impacts of behavioral therapies applied in healthcare settings for patients with ASD. This systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines. The databases MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL (Cochrane), and Lilacs were accessed, and gray and manual searches were performed. The search strategy was created with terms referring to autism and behavioral therapy. The studies were assessed qualitatively. Randomized clinical trials and observational studies demonstrated improvements in cognitive and verbal components of patients who received behavioral therapies in therapeutic settings. These results indicate a positive impact of both cognitive-behavioral therapy and ESDM on the development of patients' skills. Among the cognitive-behavioral therapies, the one based on the MASSI protocol did not impact the reduction of anxious symptoms. As for cognitive-behavioral therapy, one study demonstrated that the Behavioral Intervention for Anxiety in Children with Autism (BIACA), when compared to the Coping Cat protocol, improves cognition and reduces anxiety symptoms. Despite these results, further randomized clinical trials comparing behavioral therapies with one another are needed. In the context of behavioral therapy within a healthcare setting, the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) showed improvements in the cognitive, verbal, and social aspects of the evaluated patients. Improvement in scores sometimes is achieved independently of the group and related to the time of interventions.","Humans, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy,

"39703999","Annual Research Review: Micronutrients and their role in the treatment of paediatric mental illness.","2025-04-01","Rucklidge Julia J, Bruton Alisha, Welsh Alanna, Ast Hayleigh, Johnstone Jeanette M","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","The aim of this narrative review is to summarize evidence relating the importance of nutrient intake from diet and supplementation for paediatric mental health. We begin by reviewing several mechanisms by which nutrients maximize brain health, including enabling metabolic reactions to occur, supporting mitochondrial function, reducing inflammation and assisting with detoxification. Circumstances that may contribute to an individual requiring additional nutrients beyond what are available in the diet, such as consumption of nutritionally depleted food, individual differences in biological need, long-term medication use and gut-brain health needs are then reviewed. These factors underpin the importance of tackling deficiencies relative to individual metabolic requirements with a broad spectrum of micronutrients, as opposed to a single nutrient approach, to address personal metabolic needs and/or environmentally induced nutrient depletions. The evidence for treating psychological symptoms with supplementary micronutrients is presented, summarizing research using broad-spectrum micronutrients in the treatment of mental health issues including aggression, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and emotional dysregulation, often with medium between-group effect sizes compared with placebo, with clinically meaningful changes. The breadth and consistency of the findings highlight the importance of receiving a complete foundation of nutrients to optimize brain health; however, the small number of studies identifies the importance of future work to replicate these preliminary findings. Documented safety in 8-week randomized controlled trials with open-label extensions up to 16 weeks and longer-term follow-up for 1.5-5 years in smaller samples provide reassurance that this treatment approach does not result in serious adverse events. We provide recommendations for future research including consistency in micronutrient interventions, scalable delivery models, effectiveness and implementation studies and the need to investigate these interventions in the prevention and management of less-studied childhood psychiatric conditions.","Humans, Micronutrients, Child, Mental Disorders, Dietary

"39565505","Wearable EEG Neurofeedback Based-on Machine Learning Algorithms for Children with Autism: A Randomized, Placebo-controlled Study.","2024-12-01","Wang Xian-Na, Zhang Tong, Han Bi-Cheng, Luo Wei-Wei, Liu Wen-Hui, Yang Zhao-Yi, Disi A, Sun Yue, Yang Jin-Chen","Current medical science","Behavioral interventions have been shown to ameliorate the electroencephalogram (EEG) dynamics underlying the behavioral symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), while studies have also demonstrated that mirror neuron mu rhythm-based EEG neurofeedback training improves the behavioral functioning of individuals with ASD. This study aimed to test the effects of a wearable mu rhythm neurofeedback training system based on machine learning algorithms for children with autism. A randomized, placebo-controlled study was carried out on 60 participants aged 3 to 6 years who were diagnosed with autism, at two center-based intervention sites. The neurofeedback group received active mu rhythm neurofeedback training, while the control group received a sham neurofeedback training. Other behavioral intervention programs were similar between the two groups. After 60 sessions of treatment, both groups showed significant improvements in several domains including language, social and problem behavior. The neurofeedback group showed significantly greater improvements in expressive language (P=0.013) and cognitive awareness (including joint attention, P=0.003) than did the placebo-controlled group. Artificial intelligence-powered wearable EEG neurofeedback, as a type of brain-computer interface application, is a promising assistive technology that can provide targeted intervention for the core brain mechanisms underlying ASD symptoms.","Humans, Neurofeedback, Child, Male, Female, Electroencephalography, Child, Preschool, Machine Learning, Wearable Electronic Devices, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Algorithms","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39565505","Qiangnao Keji (BrainCo) Ltd., Hangzhou, 310027, China. jinchen.yang@brainco.tech.; Capital Medical University School of Rehabilitation Medicine, Beijing, 100068, China.

"39512897","Acute salivary cortisol response in children with ADHD during psychosocial intervention with and without therapy dogs.","2024-01-01","Schuck Sabrina E B, Zeiler Cassie N, Stehli Annamarie, Steinhoff Lydia A, Stokes Rachel Y, Jeffrey Sara E, Granger Douglas Alan","Frontiers in psychiatry","Children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) participated in a randomized clinical trial comparing animal-assisted intervention (AAI) to psychosocial treatment as usual (TAU). This brief report describes effects of AAI on acute HPA axis reactivity and regulation. Saliva was collected before, during, and after psychosocial intervention sessions with and without therapy dogs and later assayed for cortisol (ug/dL). Thirty-nine participants (n = 39) with ADHD, aged 7-9 years (79% male) provided saliva at 3 points during 90-minute sessions; (<i>i</i>) upon arrival, (<i>ii</i>) +20 minutes, and (<i>iii</i>) 15 minutes prior to departure, on 3 occasions across an 8-week intervention (weeks 1, 4, and 8). Cortisol slopes calculated within each session were compared across the intervention weeks to determine within subject and between group effect sizes. Spearman's correlations between baseline individual neurodevelopmental symptoms and in-session acute cortisol responses were also evaluated. No significant between group differences were observed in cortisol responsiveness at week-1. By week-4, in-session changes in cortisol were evident, with significantly greater decreases in the AAI group (Cohen's <i>d</i> = -.40). This pattern was also observed at week-8, with an even stronger effect-size (<i>d</i> = -0.60). Concurrent symptoms of autism were associated with the in-session acute cortisol response. Specifically, higher parent-reported symptom scores were associated with steeper decreases in cortisol across the session at week 1 (<i>r</i> = -0.42, <i>p <</i>.01) and week-8 (<i>r</i> = -0.34 <i>p</i> = .05). At week-8 this association was stronger in the AAI group (<i>r</i> = -0.53) versus TAU (<i>r</i> = -0.25), with Cohen's <i>q</i> = 0.413). AAI may influence acute HPA reactivity and regulation for children with ADHD. Concurrent symptoms of ADHD and autism may be related to individual differences in the nature of the effect. Implications of these findings for AAI as an alternative, or complementary intervention for ADHD are discussed.

"39510775","Feasibility and cross-cultural validation of an adapted social skills group training programme (KONTAKT<sup>TM</sup> CHILD) for Chinese autistic children: a waitlist RCT protocol.","2024-11-07","Lao Uchong, Zhu Huilin, Liang Fengjing, Bai Wuxia, Yin Peipei, Huang Xiaoqian, Girdler Sonya, Bölte Sven, Zou Xiaobing","BMJ open","School-age autistic children commonly experience social communication and interaction challenges in their everyday lives. While international evidence suggests that social skills group training (SSGT) programmes can support autistic children, improving their psychosocial functioning, to date there is no standardised evidence-based SSGT tailored towards the needs of autistic children aged 8-12 years living in the Chinese Mainland. Therefore, the primary objective of this study will be to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a culturally adapted 16-session version of the social skills programme KONTAKT in Chinese autistic children. Additionally, preliminary efficacy and cost-effectiveness will be assessed to inform a future definitive trial. This study will employ a randomised, single-blinded, waitlist-controlled feasibility design with 36 Chinese autistic children aged 8-12 years with IQ over 70 referred to the Child Development and Behavior Center in Guangzhou, China. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the immediate training group or the delayed training group stratified by sex. Feasibility will be assessed using quantitative and qualitative data obtained from the KONTAKT CHILD participants, their parents and facilitators of the programme. Preliminary efficacy and cost-effectiveness are assessed via quantitative data obtained at five time points. The primary efficacy outcome is participants' improvement in social skills as measured by the Contextual Assessment of Social Skills. Other outcomes include parents and teachers' reports of participants' autistic traits and adaptive functioning, participants' self-report and projective tests for self-assertiveness and psychosocial functioning, and parent reports on parental reflective functioning and perceived school support. Common process factors and their effects on outcomes will also be explored. Cost-effectiveness will consider from both societal and healthcare perspectives. The current study protocol has been reviewed and ethics approval has been obtained from the Ethical Board Committee at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (II2023-119-01). The trial was pre-registered in Chinese Clinical Trials (ChiCTR2300072136) on 5 June 2023. The results of this trial will be actively disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. Any identifiable personal information will be anonymised to protect confidentiality. 2.0, 31 July 2024.

"39467676","[A prospective randomized controlled study of neurofeedback combined with learning style profile intervention training in children with high-functioning autism].","2024-10-15","Huang Ming-Xin, Yu Qing, Li Yuan-Yuan","Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics","To explore the application of neurofeedback (NFB) combined with learning style profile (LSP) intervention training in children with high-functioning autism (HFA). A prospective study was conducted to select 86 children with HFA admitted to the hospital from February 2022 to February 2024. They were divided into two groups according to the random number table method, with 43 cases in each group. In this double-blind study, the control group was given LSP intervention training, and the observation group was given NFB intervention on the basis of the treatment used in the control group. Both groups were treated for 6 months. The scores of Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC), Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC), Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), and Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) were compared between the two groups before intervention and at 6 months after intervention. The relationship of PedsQL score with ABC, ATEC, and SRS scores was analyzed in children with HFA. After 6 months of intervention, the scores of ABC, ATEC, and SRS in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group, while the PedsQL score in the observation group was significantly higher than that in the control group (<i>P</i><0.05). The PedsQL score was negatively correlated with the ABC, ATEC, and SRS scores in children with HFA (<i>r</i>=-0.238, -0.381, -0.219 respectively; <i>P</i><0.001). NFB combined with LSP can effectively improve the clinical symptoms and social ability, control the development of the disease, and improve the quality of life in children with HFA.","Humans, Female,

"39415148","Effects of Mozart-Orff parent-child music therapy among mothers and their preschool children with autism spectrum disorder: A mixed-methods randomised controlled trial.","2024-10-16","He Yingshuang, Wong Arkers, Zhang Yuhong, Lin Jinling, Li Hao, Zhao Bingyue, Chen Tingting, Huang Shuixiu, Hu Rongfang, Liu Guihua","BMC pediatrics","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) negatively impacts mental health, particularly in mothers of autistic children who experience heightened stress. Applied behaviour analysis (ABA) and music therapy are recognised interventions for improving ASD symptoms. However, the specific benefits of parent-child music therapy and ABA for autistic children and their mothers remain uncertain. This study evaluated the effects of parent-child music therapy on preschool autistic children and their mothers. A randomised controlled trial was conducted with 100 mother-child pairs assigned to either the control group receiving ABA or the intervention group receiving both music therapy and ABA. Qualitative interviews were conducted post-intervention for 12 mothers. Children in the intervention group exhibited lower scores for ASD symptoms than those in the control group. Moreover, mothers in the intervention group demonstrated reduced dysfunctional parent-child interaction, lower overall parental stress, significantly improved family functioning, and increased levels of hope compared with those in the control group. Mothers held positive views regarding music therapy. Combining ABA with parent-child music therapy can alleviate ASD symptoms in children and reduce stress in mothers. Improved parent-child interaction and enhanced family functioning further support the benefits of this combined approach. Parent-child music therapy, combined with ABA demonstrated positive outcomes for autistic children, including reduced ASD symptoms, improved parent-child interaction, decreased parental stress, enhanced family functioning, and increased hope. These findings highlight the potential of incorporating music therapy as a valuable component in the comprehensive treatment of ASD.

"39233512","Telehealth coaching in Project ImPACT indirectly affects children's expressive language ability through parent intervention strategy use and child intentional communication: An RCT.","2024-10-01","Ingersoll Brooke, Frost Kyle M, Straiton Diondra, Ramos Anamiguel Pomales, Casagrande Karis","Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research","Parent-mediated, naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions (NDBIs) are a promising approach for supporting social communication development in young autistic children. This study examined the effect of telehealth delivery of a parent-mediated NDBI, Project ImPACT, on children's expressive language ability using a randomized control trial with intent-to-treat analysis. Sixty-four young autistic children and their primary caregiver were matched on age and developmental quotient and randomly assigned to receive 6 months of therapist-assisted Project ImPACT (i.e., telehealth coaching), self-directed Project ImPACT, or an active control. Parent-child interactions were recorded at intake and immediately post-treatment, and the children's expressive language skills were assessed at intake and a 9-month follow-up using standardized measures. Although there was no total effect of treatment group assignment on child outcomes, a serial mediation analysis revealed that therapist-assisted ImPACT had an indirect effect on children's expressive language ability at follow-up through their parents' use of the intervention strategies and their intentional communication immediately post-treatment. Findings support Project ImPACT's program theory and highlight the importance of coaching in achieving positive outcomes when delivered via telehealth.","Humans, Male, Female, Child, Preschool,

"39153149","Feasibility and Tolerability of Daily Theta Burst Stimulation in Autistic Youth with Intellectual Disabilities and Minimally Speaking Status: A Pilot Double-Blind Randomized Sham-Controlled Trial.","2024-08-17","Ni Hsing-Chang, Chen Yi-Lung, Lin Hsiang-Yuan","Journal of autism and developmental disorders","Scarce clinical trials involving autistic people with intellectual disability (ID) and minimally speaking (MS) status have been a substantial unmet research need in the field. Although earlier studies have demonstrated the feasibility and beneficial potentials of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in intellectually able autistic people, the feasibility and tolerability of applying rTMS in autistic people with ID/MS has never been studied. We conducted the world-first 4-week randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled pilot trial to investigate the feasibility, tolerability, and safety of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS, a variant of excitatory rTMS) over the left DLPFC in autistic youth with ID/MS. 25 autistic youth with ID/MS (aged 8-30 years) were randomized to a 20-session 4-week daily iTBS (n = 13) vs. sham stimulation (n = 12) with follow-up 4 and 8 weeks, respectively, after the last stimulation. A retention rate was 100% in our study. Adverse events of local pain (38%) and dizziness (8%) were only noted in the active group. All adverse events were mild and transient. There were no seizures, new behavioral problems, or other severe/serious adverse events noted. No participants dropped out due to adverse events. With a small sample size, we did not find any beneficial signal of DLPFC iTBS. Our pilot data suggest regular daily TBS treatment for four weeks is feasible, well tolerated and safe in autistic youth with ID/MS. Future randomized controlled trials with sufficiently powered samples are needed to investigate the beneficial potential of rTMS/TBS for autistic people with

"39066520","Pivotal response treatment and applied behavior analysis interventions for autism spectrum disorder delivered by human vs robotic agents: a systematic review of literature.","2025-02-01","Shayestehfar Monir, Nakhostin-Ansari Amin, Jahandideh Pardis, Memari Saeideh, Geoffrey Louie Wing-Yue, Memari Amirhossein","Disability and rehabilitation. Assistive technology","Robotic technology-aided instruction and interventions have been designed to support both Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) and Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT) interventions for children with ASD. However, to the best of our knowledge, this field has not been systematically reviewed. Thus, we aimed to systematically review the literature to determine whether ABA or PRT methods in a robotic therapeutic context yield better outcomes for individuals with ASD, specifically in terms of approaching and accepting robots. A comprehensive search of electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar was conducted. Randomized control trials (RCT) and pre-post-test design investigations that assessed the impact of ABA vs. PRT approach <i>via</i> robot-mediated technology vs. human trainers on intervention outcomes of children with ASD were selected and included in this systematic review. Finally, 13 papers met the criteria for inclusion in the systematic review. Two independent reviewers extracted the associated data from each selected study according to the standardized data extraction form. Two reviewers also assessed the quality of each study independently using the Cochrane Back Review Scale and JBI tool for quasi-experimental studies. We categorized two general classifications of findings including ABA vs. PRT as well as robotic technology vs. human. In conclusion, the existing investigations on the effect of robotic assistive technology using ABA or PRT approach are promising particularly in therapeutic contexts with a more natural context and

"39062003","Safety, Tolerability, and EEG-Based Target Engagement of STP1 (PDE3,4 Inhibitor and NKCC1 Antagonist) in a Randomized Clinical Trial in a Subgroup of Patients with ASD.","2024-06-27","Erickson Craig A, Perez-Cano Laura, Pedapati Ernest V, Painbeni Eric, Bonfils Gregory, Schmitt Lauren M, Sachs Hannah, Nelson Meredith, De Stefano Lisa, Westerkamp Grace, de Souza Adriano L S, Pohl Oliver, Laufer Offir, Issachar Gil, Blaettler Thomas, Hyvelin Jean-Marc, Durham Lynn A","Biomedicines","This study aimed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of STP1, a combination of ibudilast and bumetanide, tailored for the treatment of a clinically and biologically defined subgroup of patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), namely ASD Phenotype 1 (ASD-Phen1). We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase 1b study with two 14-day treatment phases (registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT04644003). Nine ASD-Phen1 patients were administered STP1, while three received a placebo. We assessed safety and tolerability, along with electrophysiological markers, such as EEG, Auditory Habituation, and Auditory Chirp Synchronization, to better understand STP1's mechanism of action. Additionally, we used several clinical scales to measure treatment outcomes. The results showed that STP1 was well-tolerated, with electrophysiological markers indicating a significant and dose-related reduction of gamma power in the whole brain and in brain areas associated with executive function and memory. Treatment with STP1 also increased alpha 2 power in frontal and occipital regions and improved habituation and neural synchronization to auditory chirps. Although numerical improvements were observed in several clinical scales, they did not reach statistical significance. Overall, this study suggests that STP1 is well-tolerated in ASD-Phen1 patients and shows indirect target engagement in ASD brain regions of interest.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39062003","Drug Development Unit (DDU), STALICLA SA, Campus Biotech Innovation Park, Avenue de Sécheron 15, 1202 Geneva, Switzerland.; Discovery and

"39056559","Eye movements desensitization and reprocessing with finger movements and Elite mobile health software on guilt feeling of parents of children with autism: A randomized trial.","2025-02-01","Rashidi Hadi, Sadeghian Efat, Shamsaei Farshid, Tapak Leili, Seyedi Mahdieh","Journal of psychiatric and mental health nursing","WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Taking care of an autistic child at home can be tough for parents. They struggle to balance caring for their child and other tasks. This can affect their emotional well-being and cause guilt and other psychological problems. WHAT DOES THE PAPER ADD TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing with finger movements can reduce guilt in parents of autistic children. Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing with Elite mobile health software movements can reduce guilt in parents of autistic children. The bilateral eye stimulation method using finger movements has a more sustained impact than the Elite app's bilateral stimulation method. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Healthcare providers are encouraged to learn Eye Movements Desensitization and Reprocessing. Healthcare providers are encouraged to use these methods to help with psychological issues in children with autism. Psychiatric nurses are encouraged to utilize this treatment approach for parents of children with autism, as well as to help alleviate feelings of guilt more broadly. INTRODUCTION: Caring for an autistic child at home can be challenging for parents, as it can make it difficult to balance their responsibilities. This imbalance can negatively affect the emotional well-being of the caregiver and lead to feelings of guilt. While this is a known issue, there may be gaps in knowledge specific to Iran. In this study, a new method was introduced to address this issue. This study aimed to examine the impact of desensitization with eye movements and reprocessing (EMDR) on reducing parental guilt among autistic children's families. We aim to examine the effectiveness of two different treatment methods. This study involved 90 parents (60 mothers, 30 fathers) of autistic children randomly assigned to either an experimental or control group. The two experimental groups received a 45-min intervention session once a week for 3 weeks, while the control group did not receive any intervention. Data on feelings of guilt was collected using a questionnaire. After 30 days, both groups took a follow-up test. The data were analysed using statistical software. This study found that there were significant differences in guilt feelings among different groups of EMDR therapy and a control group. Specifically, no significant differences were observed in the mean guilt scores between the experimental and control groups at the pre-intervention stage (p > .05). However, the experimental groups exhibited significantly lower mean guilt scores immediately after the intervention and 1 month later than the control group (p < .05). Immediately after the intervention and 1 month later, no significant differences were observed between the two experimental groups (p > .05). The findings of this study demonstrate the efficacy of desensitization treatment using eye movements and reprocessing in reducing feelings of guilt among autistic children's parents. In the follow-up phase, it seems that the two-way stimulation method with finger movements is more effective than Elite software in terms of the continuity of the effect. Healthcare providers are encouraged to learn and use these methods to help prevent and treat psychological issues in autistic children.","Humans, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing, Parents,

"38999736","Modulation of Gut Microbiome and Autism Symptoms of ASD Children Supplemented with Biological Response Modifier: A Randomized, Double-Blinded, Placebo-Controlled Pilot Study.","2024-06-21","Hrnciarova Jela, Kubelkova Klara, Bostik Vanda, Rychlik Ivan, Karasova Daniela, Babak Vladimir, Datkova Magdalena, Simackova Katerina, Macela Ales","Nutrients","The etiology and mechanisms of autism and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are not yet fully understood. There is currently no treatment for ASD for providing significant improvement in core symptoms. Recent studies suggest, however, that ASD is associated with gut dysbiosis, indicating that modulation of gut microbiota in children with ASD may thus reduce the manifestation of ASD symptoms. The aim of this pilot study (prospective randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled) was to evaluate efficacy of the biological response modifier Juvenil in modulating the microbiome of children with ASD and, in particular, whether Juvenil is able to alleviate the symptoms of ASD. In total, 20 children with ASD and 12 neurotypical children were included in our study. Supplementation of ASD children lasted for three months. To confirm Juvenil's impact on the gut microbiome, stool samples were collected from all children and the microbiome's composition was analyzed. This pilot study demonstrated that the gut microbiome of ASD children differed significantly from that of healthy controls and was converted by Juvenil supplementation toward a more neurotypical microbiome that positively modulated children's autism symptoms.","Humans, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Pilot Projects, Double-Blind Method, Male, Female, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Dietary

"38991740","Using Restricted Interests in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder: Results From a Preliminary Randomized Controlled Trial.","2024-07-11","Birtwell Kirstin, Goldin Rachel, Saro Hannah, McDougle Christopher, Horick Nora, Ravichandran Caitlin, Nowinski Lisa","Journal of cognitive psychotherapy","Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit significant deficits in social communication and emotion regulation skills. While cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) applications appear promising, trials to date have largely excluded social communication skill development and have not been designed to include a wider range of emotional challenges. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to pilot a uniquely modified CBT program targeting emotion regulation, including social communication training, and explicitly focusing on the child's areas of circumscribed interest in order to teach skills and promote generalization. Forty participants were randomly assigned to either the CBT group or a waitlist control (WLC) group, resulting in 20 school-aged children in each group. The treatment approach was determined to be feasible and acceptable, and therapy engagement and attendance were reasonably high. Caregivers expressed high satisfaction with the program, qualitatively citing gains in skills such as social problem-solving, emotion identification, and identifying and processing cognitive distortions. The primary outcome of postintervention changes was not significantly different between the groups (CBT vs. WLC). The mean Social Skills Improvement System score decreased by 0.44 points (95% confidence interval [CI]: -5.04, 4.15) in the CBT group and increased by 0.41 points (95% CI: -4.23, 5.04) in the WLC group, and the postintervention changes were not significantly different between the groups (difference: -0.85; 95% CI: -7.29, 5.60; <i>p</i> = .79). The estimated rate of emotional dysregulation episodes decreased by a factor of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.57, 1.56) in the CBT group and increased by a factor of 1.07 (95% CI: 0.51, 2.24) for WLC (<i>p</i> = .74). Among those who reported emotional dysregulation episodes, the mean duration decreased by 1.39 minutes (95% CI: -3.90, 6.67) less for CBT than waitlist (<i>p</i> = .60). Although satisfaction, acceptability, and emotional dysregulation outcome results from this preliminary CBT treatment for ASD are promising, sample size and measurement limitations will be important considerations to inform future trials.","Humans, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Child, Male, Female, Social Skills, Emotional Regulation, Pilot

We carried out a systematic review for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding NIBS for reducing autistic symptoms (INPLASY202370003). Sixteen articles (N = 709) met the inclusion criteria for network meta-analysis. Effect sizes were reported as standardized mean differences (SMDs) or odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Fourteen active NIBS interventions, including transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and transcranial pulse stimulation were analyzed. Only anodal tDCS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex paired with cathodal tDCS over an extracephalic location (atDCS_F3 + ctDCS_E) significantly improved autistic symptoms compared to sham controls (SMD = - 1.40, 95 %CIs = - 2.67 to - 0.14). None of the NIBS interventions markedly improved social-communication symptoms or restricted/repetitive behaviors in autistic participants. Moreover, no active NIBS interventions exhibited significant dropout rate differences compared to sham controls, and no serious adverse events were reported for any intervention.","Humans, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Network Meta-Analysis, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38981573","Department of Psychiatry, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

"38979764","Feasibility study of a parent-driven intervention for youth with Down syndrome.","2024-09-01","Stone-Heaberlin M, Blackburn A, Hoffman E K, Esbensen A J","Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR","Children with Down syndrome present with behavioural and emotional difficulties, including noncompliance, rule-breaking, emotion dysregulation and delays in executive functioning. Few behavioural interventions have been designed specifically for children with Down syndrome. The Research Units in Behavioral Intervention (RUBI) Parent Training for Disruptive Behaviors is a structured empirically supported parent training programme developed for caregivers of children with autism. This feasibility trial explored the feasibility and acceptability of an abbreviated RUBI intervention with caregivers of children with Down syndrome and identified promising outcome measures to target in future larger clinical trials. A double-blind randomised feasibility pilot clinical trial allocated participants to a behavioural intervention (BEH) or educational (EDU) group. BEH and EDU consisted of five individual sessions over the course of 5 to 8 weeks. Measures were administered to 20 caregivers and their youth with Down syndrome at three time points. Both BEH and EDU were rated as feasible with high parental adherence and acceptable with high treatment satisfaction. Both BEH and EDU demonstrated decreased externalising behaviours, irritability and hyperactivity and improved behavioural regulation in executive functioning over time. No impact was noted on caregiver functioning. The feasibility trial has strong findings regarding feasibility and satisfaction and has promising findings regarding the selection of measures for future trials testing an adapted RUBI programme and an education programme to reduce behavioural challenges in children with Down syndrome. Larger scale clinical trials are needed to confirm promising findings of these feasible treatments.","Humans, Down Syndrome, Feasibility Studies, Male, Female, Child, Pilot Projects, Adolescent,

"38926739","Effectiveness of a positive psychology and mindfulness-based app on mental health for parents of children with a neurodevelopmental disorder: study protocol of a pragmatic international randomized controlled trial.","2024-06-26","Tönis Kim J M, Drossaert Constance H C, Ten Klooster Peter M, Schaer Marie, Bourgeron Thomas, Buitelaar Jan K, Sadaka Yair, Freitag Christine M, Lapidus Keren Mayer, Chiocchetti Andreas G, Staal Wouter G, Bohlmeijer Ernst T","Trials","Parents of children with a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) experience more stress than parents of typically developing children. In a cocreation process with experts and parents, a low-threshold application that uses exercises based on the principles of positive psychology and mindfulness was developed. This application, called ""Adappt,"" aims at enhancing the ability to adapt of the parents and caregivers of children with NDDs and at supporting their mental health. This protocol describes the evaluation study of the effectiveness of Adappt, its core working mechanisms and user experiences. A pragmatic international multicenter randomized controlled trial will compare the effectiveness of Adappt with a (delayed) waitlist control condition. At least 212 parents or primary caregivers of children younger than 18 years diagnosed with or suspected of a NDD will be randomly assigned to the intervention or waitlist control condition. Participants are excluded if they have severe anxiety or depression levels or are in treatment for mental health issues. Measures will be collected online at baseline, post-intervention (1 month after baseline), and 4 and 7 months after baseline. The primary outcome is the improvement in generic sense of ability to adapt as measured with the Generic Sense of Ability to Adapt Scale (GSAAS; (Front Psychol 14:985408, 2023)) at 4-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes are mental well-being, (parental) distress, and client satisfaction with ""Adappt."" Results of this study will contribute to knowledge on the effectiveness of a low-threshold application for parents of children with a NDD in multiple countries. If the application is found to be effective in improving mental health, recommendations will be made for implementation in health care. This study is registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT06248762) on February 8, 2024, and the Open Science Framework ( https://osf.io/5znqv ).","Humans, Mindfulness, Parents, Mental Health,

"38719439","Examining variability in Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Intervention strategy use in caregivers of children with autism spectrum disorders.","2025-01-01","Brown Hallie, Swain Deanna, Kim Hye Won, Rogers Sally, Estes Annette, Kasari Connie, Lord Catherine, Kim So Hyun","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBIs) for young children with autism spectrum disorder commonly involve caregiver-mediated approaches. However, to date, there is limited research on how caregivers' skills change, and, in turn, impact child outcomes. We evaluated the NDBI strategy use of 191 caregivers prior to participation in NDBIs (or control groups) across multiple randomized controlled trials, using the Measure of NDBI Strategy Implementation, Caregiver Change (MONSI-CC). Clustering analyses were used to examine caregiver variability in NDBI strategy use at intervention entry. Generalized Linear Mixed Models were used to examine changes in caregiver strategy use over the course of intervention and its impact on changes in children's social communication. Using clustering analysis, we found that caregivers' baseline skills fit four profiles: limited, emerging, variable, and consistent/high, with few demographic factors distinguishing these groups. Caregivers starting with limited or emerging skills improved in their strategy use with intervention. Caregivers starting with more skills (consistent/high or variable) maintained higher skills over intervention. Children of caregivers in these groups who received target NDBIs improved in their social communication skills. Results suggested that caregiver skills improve through participation in NDBIs and may directly contribute to their children's outcomes, although more research on mediating factors is needed. Individualized approaches for caregivers and their children starting with differing skill profiles at intervention entry may be warranted.","Humans, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Caregivers, Male, Female,

However, studies investigating maternal selenium in relation to child neurodevelopmental disorders are scarce. 719 mother-child pairs from the prospective population-based Odense Child Cohort study in Denmark were included. Three selenium biomarkers, i.e. concentrations of serum selenium, selenoprotein P (SELENOP), and activity of glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3), along with serum copper, zinc and iron were measured in early third trimester (at 28.9+/-0.8 weeks of pregnancy). ADHD and ASD traits in children were assessed systematically using the established Child Behaviour Checklist at 5 years of age, based on a Danish reference cohort with cut-off at 90th percentile. Multivariable regression models adjusted for biologically relevant confounders were applied. 155 of 719 (21.6 %) children had ASD traits and 59 of 719 (8.2 %) children had traits of ADHD at 5 years of age. In crude and adjusted models, all three selenium biomarkers associated inversely with ADHD traits. For ADHD, fully adjusted OR for 10 μg/L increment in selenium was 0.76 (95 % CI 0.60, 0.94), for one mg/L increment in SELENOP was 0.73 (0.56, 0.95), and for 10 U/L increment in GPx3 was 0.93 (0.87,1.00). Maternal total selenium was inversely associated with child ASD traits, OR per 10 μg/L increment was 0.85 (0.74, 0,98). SELENOP and GPx3 were not associated with ASD traits. The associations were specific to selenium, as other trace elements such as copper, zinc, or iron were not associated with the outcomes. The results provide coherent evidence for selenium deficiency as a risk factor for ADHD and ASD traits in an environment with borderline supply, the causality of which should be elucidated in a randomized controlled trial.","Humans, Selenium, Female, Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity, Pregnancy, Glutathione Peroxidase, Male, Denmark, Child, Preschool, Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects, Selenoprotein P, Adult, Biomarkers, Prospective Studies, Autistic Disorder, Cohort Studies, Child, Zinc, Copper","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38704054","Institute for Experimental Endocrinology, Max Rubner Center (MRC) for Cardiovascular Metabolic Renal Research, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.; Department of Clinical Research, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark; Department of Child and Adolescent Mental Health, Mental Health Services in the Region of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.; Institute for Experimental Endocrinology, Max Rubner Center (MRC) for Cardiovascular Metabolic Renal Research, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.

"38688101","Comparative efficacy of family mediated intervention versus early intensive behavioural intervention on symptom domains in children with autism spectrum disorder: A randomized controlled trial.","2024-06-01","Ranjan Rajeev, Jain Meha, Sinha Muskan, Kumar Pankaj, Ahmad Shamshad, Maharshi Vikas","Asian journal of psychiatry","Family Mediated Intervention (FMI) and Early Intensive Behavioural Intervention (EIBI) are found to be standard of care for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Comparison of their efficacy were assessed using ISAA as primary outcome measure. This study was a parallel arm, open label, randomized active- controlled non-inferiority clinical trial. 50 Children diagnosed with ASD were randomized into FMI and EIBI groups. Clinical status was checked by using Indian scale for assessment of autism (ISAA), Oro- motor and sensory profile at baseline, after three and six months. Difference between change in mean ISAA score between FMI and EIBI group at the end of 6 months as per protocol (PP) analysis was -7.23 (CI=-18.41, 3.94), which was within pre-defined clinically relevant non-inferiority (NI) margin of - 24. FMI was found to be non-inferior to EIBI at the end of 6 months as the lower bound of 95% CI (-18.41) for ISAA score was higher than NI margin. ISAA scores were found to be statistically lower in both FMI and EIBI groups at the end point compared to baseline which indicated improvement in symptom severity. FMI was non-inferior to EIBI as therapy for children with ASD at the end of six months. Finding also indicated longer duration of treatment is required for FMI to be superior. FMI can be recommended for children with ASD in view of improved ISAA scores reported in our study.

"38670664","Parent-Led Cognitive Behavioral Teletherapy for Anxiety in Autistic Youth: A Randomized Trial Comparing Two Levels of Therapist Support.","2024-05-01","Guzick Andrew G, Schneider Sophie C, Kook Minjee, Rose Iacono Julia, Weinzimmer Saira A, Quast Troy, Olsen Sean M, Hughes Killian Rainey, Jellinek-Russo Emily, Garcia Amanda Perozo, Candelari Abigail, Berry Leandra N, Goin-Kochel Robin P, Goodman Wayne K, Storch Eric A","Behavior therapy","Parent-led cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an efficient, promising form of therapy that may be well suited for autistic youth with anxiety disorders, though to date it has been minimally tested. In this study, 87 autistic youth (7 to 13 years old) with anxiety disorders and their parents were randomized to two forms of parent-led CBT in which parents led their child through a guided CBT workbook across 12 weeks: one with low therapist contact (four 30-minute telehealth calls), and one with standard therapist contact (ten 60-minute telehealth calls). Anxiety, functional impairment, and autism features significantly declined across therapy, without differences between groups. High satisfaction was reported in both groups, though significantly higher satisfaction ratings were reported in standard-contact CBT. Responder rates were 69% of completers at posttreatment (70% in standard contact, 68% in low contact) and 86% at 3-month follow-up (86% in standard contact, 87% in low contact). Low-contact CBT was estimated to incur an average cost of $755.70 per family compared with $1,978.34 in standard-contact CBT. Parent-led CBT with minimal or standard therapist contact both appear to be effective CBT delivery formats for autistic youth with anxiety disorders, with significant cost savings for low-contact CBT.","Humans, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Male, Female, Adolescent, Child, Parents, Anxiety Disorders, Telemedicine, Autistic Disorder, Treatment Outcome, Anxiety, Patient Satisfaction, Mental Health Teletherapy","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38670664","Baylor College of Medicine.; Baylor College of Medicine; University of Houston.; Baylor College of Medicine, Meyer Center for Developmental Pediatrics and Autism, Texas Children's Hospital.; University of Pennsylvania; Baylor College of Medicine.

"38606582","The effectiveness and safety of dialectical behavior therapy for suicidal ideation and behavior in autistic adults: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial.","2024-07-01","Huntjens Anne, van den Bosch L M C Wies, Sizoo Bram, Kerkhof Ad, Smit Filip, van der Gaag Mark","Psychological medicine","Many autistic people in mental health are suicidal. This study evaluated the effectiveness of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) <i>v.</i> treatment as usual (TAU) in reducing suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. At six Dutch mental health centers, 123 outpatients (18-65 years) with DSM-5 diagnosed autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and suicidal behavior were randomly assigned to the DBT intervention group (<i>n</i> = 63) or TAU control group (<i>n</i> = 60). Assessments were conducted at baseline, post-treatment at 6 months and 12-month follow-up. The primary outcomes were severity of suicidal ideation and frequency of suicide attempts. The severity of depression and social anxiety were secondary outcomes. At end-of-treatment, DBT significantly reduced both suicidal ideation (<i>z</i> = -2.24; <i>p</i> = 0.025; <i>b</i> = -4.41; s.e. = 197.0) and suicide attempts (<i>z</i> = -3.15; <i>p</i> = 0.002; <i>IRR</i> = 0.046; s.e. = 0.045) compared to TAU, but lost statistical significance at the 12-month follow-up. Depression severity significantly decreased with DBT (<i>z</i> = -1.99; <i>p</i> = 0.046: <i>b</i> = -2.74; s.e. = 1.37) remaining so at 12 months (<i>z</i> = -2.46; <i>p</i> = 0.014; <i>b</i> = -3.37; s.e. = 1.37). No effects were observed on social anxiety. Severe adverse events included two suicides in the TAU condition. DBT is an acceptable, safe, and short-term effective intervention to reduce suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in autistic adults with suicidal behavior.","Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Female, Humans,

"38492129","Lack of effects of eight-week left dorsolateral prefrontal theta burst stimulation on white matter macro/microstructure and connection in autism.","2024-08-01","Yeh Chun-Hung, Lin Po-Chun, Tseng Rung-Yu, Chao Yi-Ping, Wu Chen-Te, Chou Tai-Li, Chen Rou-Shayn, Gau Susan Shur-Fen, Ni Hsing-Chang, Lin Hsiang-Yuan","Brain imaging and behavior","Whether brain stimulation could modulate brain structure in autism remains unknown. This study explored the impact of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on white matter macro/microstructure in intellectually able children and emerging adults with autism. Sixty autistic participants were randomized (30 active) and received active or sham cTBS for eight weeks twice per week, 16 total sessions using a double-blind (participant-, rater-, analyst-blinded) design. All participants received high-angular resolution diffusion MR imaging at baseline and week 8. Twenty-eight participants in the active group and twenty-seven in the sham group with good imaging quality entered the final analysis. With longitudinal fixel-based analysis and network-based statistics, we found no significant difference between the active and sham groups in changes of white matter macro/microstructure and connections following cTBS. In addition, we found no association between baseline white matter macro/microstructure and autistic symptom changes from baseline to week 8 in the active group. In conclusion, we did not find a significant impact of left DLPFC cTBS on white matter macro/microstructure and connections in children and emerging adults with autism. These findings need to be interpreted in the context that the current intellectually able cohort in a single university hospital site limits the generalizability. Future studies are required to investigate if higher stimulation intensities and/or doses, other personal factors, or rTMS parameters might confer significant brain structural changes visible on MRI in ASD.","Humans, Male, White Matter, Female, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Double-Blind Method, Child, Autistic Disorder, Young Adult, Adolescent, Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, Diffusion

"38491260","The Physiological and Clinical-Behavioral Effects of Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback in Adolescents with Autism: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.","2024-09-01","Thoen Anoushka, Alaerts Kaat, Prinsen Jellina, Steyaert Jean, Van Damme Tine","Applied psychophysiology and biofeedback","Adolescents with autism present lower levels of cardiac vagal modulation. It was hypothesized that Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback (HRVB) increases cardiac vagal modulation in adolescents with autism, resulting in positive effects on physiological and psychosocial parameters. It was also hypothesized that home-based HRVB training is feasible. In a single-blind, randomized sham-controlled pilot trial, adolescents with autism performed supervised HRVB (n = 24) or sham training (n = 20). Subsequently, half of the adolescents received HRVB training at home, whereas the other subset did not practice. Physiological, cortisol and behavioral data were collected during stress-provoking assessments before and after each training period. Supervised HRVB resulted in a late increase in cardiac vagal modulation in adolescents with autism. Heart rate increased and cortisol decreased significantly immediately after supervised HRVB, but none of these effects remained after follow-up. Following supervised HRVB, no significant change in psychosocial functioning was found. Home-based HRVB was feasible, adolescents reported lower symptoms of stress, but a significant decrease in compliance rate was found. HRVB is feasible and effective in adolescents with autism given the late-emerging increases in cardiac vagal modulation and decrease in stress symptoms. Replicating this study with a larger sample and further exploration of the working mechanisms of HRVB are recommended.

"38446265","A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial of Motivation-Based Social Skills Group Treatment with Parent Training.","2025-04-01","Shkel Jane, Geng Alicia, Pilchak Elise, Millan Maria Estefania, Schwartzman Jessica M, Schuck Rachel, Bundang Maria Victoria, Barnowski Agatha, Slap Devon M, Stratford Sydney, Hardan Antonio Y, Phillips Jennifer M, Gengoux Grace W","Journal of autism and developmental disorders","Despite the popularity of social skills groups, there remains a need for empirical investigation of treatment effects, especially when targeting pivotal aspects of social functioning such as initiations to peers. The goal of the present study was to conduct a randomized controlled trial of a 12-week social intervention (SUCCESS), which combined an inclusive social group with a parent education program. Twenty-five 4- to 6-year-olds with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) were randomized to SUCCESS (N = 11) or to treatment as usual (N = 14). Combining a peer group model with a parent training program, the SUCCESS intervention used naturalistic behavioral techniques (e.g., environmental arrangement, natural reinforcement) to increase social initiations to peers. After 12 weeks, children participating in the SUCCESS program made more frequent initiations to peers than children in the treatment-as-usual group, including more prompted and unprompted initiations to request. Additional gains in clinician-rated social functioning were observed in children randomized to SUCCESS, while differential treatment effects were not detected in parent-rated measures. However, lower baseline social motivation was associated with greater parent-reported initiation improvement. This study provides preliminary support for the efficacy of a naturalistic, behavioral social skills intervention to improve peer initiations for children with ASD. The findings suggest that using a motivation-based social skills group was effective in increasing both prompted and spontaneous initiations to peers, and highlights the need for further research into the role of baseline social motivation in predicting social skills treatment response.","Humans, Male, Female, Child, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Social Skills, Motivation, Child, Preschool, Pilot

Co-occurring chronic gastrointestinal symptoms are common among autistic individuals and can adversely affect their quality of life. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of oral encapsulated faecal microbiome transfer (FMT) in improving gastrointestinal symptoms and well-being among autistic adolescents and adults. This double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial will recruit 100 autistic adolescents and adults aged 16-45 years, who have mild to severe gastrointestinal symptoms (Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale (GSRS) score ≥2.0). We will also recruit eight healthy donors aged 18-32 years, who will undergo extensive clinical screening. Recipients will be randomised 1:1 to receive FMT or placebo, stratified by biological sex. Capsules will be administered over two consecutive days following an overnight bowel cleanse with follow-up assessments at 6, 12 and 26 weeks post-treatment. The primary outcome is GSRS score at 6 weeks. Other assessments include anthropometry, body composition, hair cortisol concentration, gut microbiome profile, urine/plasma gut-derived metabolites, plasma markers of gut inflammation/permeability and questionnaires on general well-being, sleep quality, physical activity, food diversity and treatment tolerability. Adverse events will be recorded and reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee. Ethics approval for the study was granted by the Central Health and Disability Ethics Committee on 24 August 2021 (reference number: 21/CEN/211). Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented to both scientific and consumer group audiences.

"38216125","A pilot, single-arm feasibility study of an integrated cognitive-behavioral treatment for anxiety in young autistic children.","2024-02-17","Keefer Amy, Perrin Jeremy, Singh Vini, Holingue Calliope, Winchell Sarah, Vasa Roma A","Journal of pediatric psychology","Anxiety is prevalent in young autistic children under 7 years of age. Yet there is a paucity of empirically based interventions for this age group. DINO Strategies for Anxiety and Uncertainty Reduction (DINOSAUR) is an innovative cognitive behavioral intervention that seeks to optimize treatment response in young autistic children by targeting anxiety and the contributing mechanisms of intolerance of uncertainty and parental accommodation using a telehealth delivery model. This pilot, single-arm study examines the preliminary feasibility of DINOSAUR. Fourteen autistic children ages 4-6 years with average language and cognitive skills and their parents received the intervention. Quantitative and qualitative data pertaining to parent satisfaction and treatment outcomes were collected. Attendance, retention, and parent satisfaction ratings offer preliminary support for the feasibility of the treatment model. Change in clinical severity ratings on a semi-structured parent interview of anxiety and parents' qualitative report suggests the potential to benefit young autistic children.

"38170431","Overview of Meta-Analyses on Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.","2025-01-01","Song Jinwei, Reilly Molly, Reichow Brian","Journal of autism and developmental disorders","We conducted an overview of reviews to determine the effects of naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions (NDBIs; Schreibman et al. (2015) J Autism Dev Disorders 45:2411-2428) on children with autism spectrum disorder under 8 years old. We conducted an electronic database search of Academic Search Premier, CINHAL, ERIC, Medline, and APA PsycINFO in October 2022 and August 2023 and utilized snowball methods to locate relevant reviews of NDBI. We included reviews meeting the following inclusion criteria: (1) review included a meta-analytic synthesis for at least one child outcome; (2) primary studies examined a NDBI; (3) primary studies included children with ASD with a mean pre-treatment age under eight years; (4) primary studies were conducted using a two-group comparison design; and (5) review was published in English. We extracted data on characteristics of the review, participant characteristics from the primary studies, intervention characteristics, and assessed the risk of bias of the included reviews. We conducted a narrative synthesis across outcomes reported in the included reviews. We included five reviews from six reports in this overview. Two reviews included studies that examined the Early Start Denver Model, two reviews included studies that examined the Pivotal Response Treatment, and one review included studies examining NDBIs collectively. We found positive effects of NDBIs on child's communication/language, cognition, and adaptive behavior. We found mixed effects for NDBIs on autism symptomatology and restricted and repetitive behaviors. Examination of moderator analyses reported in the included reviews suggested variables influencing the effects of NDBIs included proximity of outcome to intervention, boundedness of outcome to intervention, and study location. As shown in this overview, positive effects of NDBI for young children with ASD are supported by meta-analytic evidence. While the overall findings for NDBI across reviews are positive, the findings on specific outcomes and influential variables moderating the effects of NDBI are inconsistent. Additional evidence from randomized controlled trials and future meta-analyses are needed to strengthen our knowledge of the effects of NDBI for young children with ASD.Protocol Registration: PROSPERO CRD42022353045.","Humans, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Child, Child, Preschool, Meta-Analysis as Topic","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38170431","A.

"38167302","Chronic oxytocin administration stimulates the oxytocinergic system in children with autism.","2024-01-02","Moerkerke Matthijs, Daniels Nicky, Tibermont Laura, Tang Tiffany, Evenepoel Margaux, Van der Donck Stephanie, Debbaut Edward, Prinsen Jellina, Chubar Viktoria, Claes Stephan, Vanaudenaerde Bart, Willems Lynn, Steyaert Jean, Boets Bart, Alaerts Kaat","Nature communications","Clinical efficacy of intranasal administration of oxytocin is increasingly explored in autism spectrum disorder, but to date, the biological effects of chronic administration regimes on endogenous oxytocinergic function are largely unknown. Here exploratory biological assessments from a completed randomized, placebo-controlled trial showed that children with autism (n = 79, 16 females) receiving intranasal oxytocin for four weeks (12 IU, twice daily) displayed significantly higher salivary oxytocin levels 24 hours after the last oxytocin nasal spray administration, but no longer at a four-week follow up session. Regarding salivary oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) epigenetics (DNA-methylation), oxytocin-induced reductions in OXTR DNA-methylation were observed, suggesting a facilitation of oxytocin receptor expression in the oxytocin compared to the placebo group. Notably, heightened oxytocin levels post-treatment were significantly associated with reduced OXTR DNA-methylation and improved feelings of secure attachment. These findings indicate that four weeks of chronic oxytocin administration stimulated the endogenous oxytocinergic system in children with autism.","Child, Female, Humans, Oxytocin, Autistic Disorder,

"38060224","Nature-Based Interventions for Autistic Children: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","2023-12-01","Fan Myrian Sze Nga, Li William Ho Cheung, Ho Laurie Long Kwan, Phiri Lophina, Choi Kai Chow","JAMA network open","There is a gap in the evidence regarding nature-based interventions (NBIs) for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To systematically review and meta-analyze available evidence on the health-related outcomes in NBIs for children with ASD. The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane, Embase, Emcare, Education Resources Information Center, Global Health, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science were searched from inception until May 2023. Google Scholar and references from included studies were searched for additional studies. Included studies were randomized clinical trials (RCTs), controlled studies, and single-group before-and-after studies that reported health-related outcomes. This review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) reporting guidelines. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to synthesize the data. The findings of studies that were ineligible for meta-analysis were summarized according to the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWIM) reporting guidelines. The outcomes of interest were health-related outcomes (ie, social functioning, behavioral functioning, emotional functioning, sensory functioning) and the self-reported well-being of children with ASD. A total of 24 studies with 717 participants (mean age range, 5.3 to 17.8 years; 141 [21.9%] female) were included. A meta-analysis from 13 studies indicated a significant negative moderate association between NBIs and social communication (standardized mean difference [SMD], -0.59; 95% CI, -0.85 to -0.34). For behavioral functioning outcomes, NBIs showed a significant moderate association with reduced hyperactivity (SMD, -0.56; 95% CI, -0.86 to -0.26) and a small to moderate association with reduced irritability (SMD, -0.49; 95% CI, -0.79 to -0.19). For sensory functioning, NBIs were significantly associated with improved inattention and distractibility (SMD, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.60). Significant moderate associations were observed in sensory seeking (SMD, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.33 to 1.22; P < .001; I2 = 0%) and sensory sensitivity (SMD, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.12 to 1.00; P = .01; I2 = 0%). Heterogeneity of the intervention effects was not high, and I2 ranged from 0% to 67%. The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggested an association of NBIs in group-based recreational therapy with experiential learning with positive short-term outcomes on sensory, social, and behavioral functioning for children with ASD.

"38009186","Community-guided, autism-adapted group cognitive behavioral therapy for depression in autistic youth (CBT-DAY): Preliminary feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy.","2024-08-01","Schwartzman Jessica M, Roth Marissa C, Paterson Ann V, Jacobs Alexandra X, Williams Zachary J","Autism : the international journal of research and practice","Depression in youth is a significant public health problem worldwide, particularly for autistic youth who are over twice as likely to experience depression than their non-autistic peers. Although pathways to depression are complex, emotional reactivity and negative self-esteem are two risk factors for depression in autistic and non-autistic youth. Although autistic youth are more likely to experience depression than their non-autistic peers, psychotherapy options for autistic youth are very limited; community guidance in the development and testing of psychotherapy programs is a promising approach in autism. Therefore, in this study, we designed an autism-adapted CBT-DAY, in collaboration with autistic community members. Specifically, CBT-DAY combined neurodiversity-affirming and cognitive behavioral approaches to target emotional reactivity and self-esteem in youth to improve depressive symptom severity in a group setting across 12 weeks. We examined the preliminary feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of CBT-DAY in a pilot non-randomized trial. In addition, we implemented a rigorous protocol for assessing, monitoring, and addressing potential harms in this intervention. Results from 24 autistic youth (11-17 years old) suggest that CBT-DAY may be feasible to use in an outpatient clinical setting and generally acceptable to youth and their caregivers. Participation in CBT-DAY may be associated with significant improvements in youth emotional reactivity and self-esteem, as well as depressive symptom severity per self-report only. Exploratory analyses showed that participation in CBT-DAY may also be associated with significant improvements in internalizing symptoms. Findings demonstrate the potential promise of neurodiversity-affirming and cognitive behavioral approaches to treating depressive symptoms in some autistic youth.","Humans, Male, Cognitive Behavioral

In the current clinical trial, we sought to isolate the most effective strategies to improve short-term and long-term child communication outcomes. Results demonstrated how children may benefit from caregiver prompts to facilitate long-term language outcomes.

"37930738","The impact of ILF neurofeedback on inhibitory control in high-functioning adolescents with autism spectrum disorder: Preliminary evidence of a randomized controlled trial.","2025-01-01","Esmaeilzadeh Kanafgourabi Seyedeh Neda, Shabani Mohsen, Mirchi Zahra, Aliyari Hamed, Mahdavi Parisa","Applied neuropsychology. Child","Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often exhibit impairments in inhibitory control, which can impact their cognitive functioning. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of Infra-Low Frequency (ILF) neurofeedback in improving inhibitory control among high-functioning adolescents with ASD. A single-blind, two-armed randomized controlled trial was conducted with 24 adolescents with ASD randomly divided into two groups (active and sham; <i>n</i> = 12 per group). Both groups participated in 15 sessions of one-hour ILF neurofeedback, three times per week. The ILF neurofeedback protocol was applied to the active group, while the sham group received an inactive intervention. Outcomes were measured at the pretest, post-test, and follow-up stages. ILF neurofeedback significantly improved inhibitory control in adolescents with ASD, as indicated by improvements in behavioral measures and absolute power analysis. The most significant differences were observed in alpha, theta, and gamma waves located in the central areas of the left gyrus. However, no significant effect was observed at the follow-up level on either behavioral measures or absolute power. The results suggest that ILF neurofeedback is effective in improving inhibitory control in high-functioning adolescents with ASD. This non-invasive intervention has the potential to improve inhibitory control in this population. However, future research is needed to determine the long-term effects of ILF neurofeedback.","Humans, Adolescent, Neurofeedback, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Male, Female, Single-Blind Method,

Music therapy holds promise as an intervention for individuals with autism, harnessing their strengths in music processing to enhance communication and expression. While previous randomized controlled trials have demonstrated positive outcomes in terms of global improvement and quality of life, their reliance on psychological outcomes restricts our understanding of underlying mechanisms. This paper introduces the protocol for the Music for Autism study, a randomized crossover trial designed to investigate the effects of a 12-week music therapy intervention on a range of psychometric, neuroimaging, and biological outcomes in school-aged children with autism. The protocol builds upon previous research and aims to both replicate and expand upon findings that demonstrated improvements in social communication and functional brain connectivity following a music intervention. The primary objective of this trial is to determine whether music therapy leads to improvements in social communication and functional brain connectivity as compared to play-based therapy. In addition, secondary aims include exploring various relevant psychometric, neuroimaging, and biological outcomes. To achieve these objectives, we will enroll 80 participants aged 6-12 years in this international, assessor-blinded, crossover randomized controlled trial. Each participant will be randomly assigned to receive either music therapy or play-based therapy for a period of 12 weeks, followed by a 12-week washout period, after which they will receive the alternate intervention. Assessments will be conducted four times, before and after each intervention period. The protocol of the Music for Autism trial provides a comprehensive framework for studying the effects of music therapy on a range of multidimensional outcomes in children with autism. The findings from this trial have the potential to contribute to the development of evidence-based interventions that leverage strengths in music processing to address the complex challenges faced by individuals with autism. <b>Clinical Trial Registration</b>: Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT04936048.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37886114","Division of Psychiatry, Haukeland University

"37873560","The use of noninvasive brain stimulation techniques in autism spectrum disorder.","2024-01-01","Oberman Lindsay M, Francis Sunday M, Lisanby Sarah H","Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research","Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), have recently emerged as alternative, nonpharmacological interventions for a variety of psychiatric, neurological, and neurodevelopmental conditions. NIBS is beginning to be applied in both research and clinical settings for the treatment of core and associated symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) including social communication deficits, restricted and repetitive behaviors, irritability, hyperactivity, depression and impairments in executive functioning and sensorimotor integration. Though there is much promise for these targeted device-based interventions, in other disorders (including adult major depressive disorder (MDD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) where rTMS is FDA cleared), data on the safety and efficacy of these interventions in individuals with ASD is limited especially in younger children when neurodevelopmental interventions typically begin. Most studies are open-label, small scale, and/or focused on a restricted subgroup of individuals with ASD. There is a need for larger, randomized controlled trials that incorporate neuroimaging in order to develop predictive biomarkers of treatment response and optimize treatment parameters. We contend that until such studies are conducted, we do not have adequate estimates of the safety and efficacy of NIBS interventions in children across the spectrum. Thus, broad off-label use of these techniques in this population is not supported by currently available evidence. Here we discuss the existing data on the use of NIBS to treat symptoms related to ASD and discuss future directions for the field.","Child, Adult, Humans, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation,

"37803891","Evaluation of the effectiveness of behavioral interventions for autism spectrum disorders: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies.","2024-01-01","Pruneti Carlo, Coscioni Gabriella, Guidotti Sara","Clinical child psychology and psychiatry","The objective of this research was to assess the efficacy of behavioral therapy interventions in the treatment of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The study utilized the PubMed and Embase databases to locate randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental treatment studies, and randomized clinical trial comparisons. The experimental group received treatment based on an applied behavioral approach, such as PECS, DTT, PRT, TEACCH, ESDM, and EIBI. After examining seventeen studies, the researchers found that each type of behavioral intervention had a positive impact. Naturalistic protocols that employed PRT and PECS improved ASD symptoms in general, despite their targeting of particular cognitive domains such as language. ESDM enhanced receptive language, particularly in preschool-aged children. Structured and integrated interventions, like EIBI and TEACCH, improved overall adaptive functioning. Combining DTT with a TEACCH program produced greater benefits in linguistic, affective-social, and personal autonomy domains. However, there is a scarcity of high-quality research available on behavioral interventions for ASD. Further comparative studies are necessary to identify cost-efficient interventions. For example, PRT and PECS significantly improved social communication skills in only 15-40 hours over six months. The authors emphasized the need for continued research and the application of evidence-based interventions in specialized settings.","Child, Child, Preschool, Humans, Autism Spectrum Disorder,

"37725597","Efficacy of nonpharmacological interventions targeting social function in children and adults with autism spectrum disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","2023-01-01","Yu Zhili, Zhang Peiming, Tao Chenyang, Lu Liming, Tang Chunzhi","PloS one","This paper aimed to evaluate the use of nonpharmacological interventions for the management of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The effects of acupuncture and behavioural therapy, two nonpharmalogical interventions, on social function in ASD patients are still controversial. This meta-analysis investigated the impact of these two treatments and compared their effects. Seven electronic databases were systematically searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the use of acupuncture or behavioural therapy for ASD. A meta-analysis was carried out using Review Manager 5.4 software. Continuous data are reported as mean differences (MDs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). An assessment of methodological quality using the Cochrane risk-of-bias (ROB) tool for trials was carried out. The Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was applied to evaluate the quality (certainty) of evidence for results regarding social function indicators. Thirty RCTs on acupuncture and 36 on behavioural therapy were included. Compared with the control condition, body acupuncture (SMD: 0.76, 95% CI: [0.52, 1.01]; low certainty), modern acupuncture technology (SMD: 0.84, 95% CI: [0.32, 1.35]; low certainty), cognitive behavioural therapy (SMD: 0.42, 95% CI: [0.26, 0.58]; high certainty), the Denver model (SMD: 0.61, 95% CI: [0.23, 0.99]; moderate certainty) and social skills training (SMD: 0.56, 95% CI: [0.41, 0.71]; moderate certainty) improved social functioning. Behavioural therapies (such as CBT, the Denver model, social skills training), improved the social functioning of patients with ASD in the short and long term, as supported by high- and moderate-quality evidence. Acupuncture (including scalp acupuncture, body acupuncture and use of modern acupuncture technology) also improved social functioning, as supported by low- and very low-quality evidence. More high-quality evidence is needed to confirm the effect of acupoint catgut embedding and Early Intensive Behavioural Intervention (EIBI).","Humans, Adult, Child, Acupuncture Therapy, Behavior

"37493149","Mindfulness Parenting and Childish Play: A Clinical Trial With Parents of Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders.","2023-08-01","Rojas-Torres Liliana P, Alonso-Esteban Yurena, Alcantud-Marín Francisco","Psicothema","Problems of behaviour, communication, and social interaction associated with Autism Spectrum Disorders can overwhelm parents. Disturbances in parents' psychological well-being (anxiety, depression) affect adherence to treatment, making it less effective. There is a need to investigate how to increase psychological wellbeing in parents of children with autism. An 8-week brief training programme using the Mindfulness Parenting (MP) intervention was applied to fourteen parents (6 couples and two mothers). Participants were assigned to one of two groups, both groups received the same treatment but at two different time points. Measures of anxiety (SCAARED), parental stress (PSI-4), autism severity level (AIM) and mindfulness awareness (FFMQ), were assessed. Analysis indicates that MP training increased mindfulness awareness, increasing non-judgment and reactivity, and consequently, reduced anxiety (parental, general, social), improving parent-child interaction. This improvement did not influence parents' perception of the severity of the disorder. The small number of participants precludes generalisation of the results. More clinical trials are needed to demonstrate the usefulness of including these programmes in early intervention services, as well as profiles of parents who may potentially benefit from

"37267443","Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for autistic spectrum disorders.","2023-06-01","Ure Alexandra, Cox Georgina R, Haslam Richard, Williams Katrina","The Cochrane database of systematic reviews","Autism spectrum disorder (autism) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterised by impairments in social communication and interaction, plus restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour and interests. Whilst some people embrace autism as part of their identity, others struggle with their difficulties, and some seek treatment. There are no current interventions that result in complete reduction of autism features. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter for the cholinergic system and has a role in attention, novelty seeking, and memory. Low levels of acetylcholine have been investigated as a potential contributor to autism symptomatology. Donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine (commonly referred to as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) all inhibit acetylcholinesterase, and have slightly different modes of action and biological availability, so their effectiveness and side-effect profiles may vary. The effect of various acetylcholinesterase inhibitor on core autism features across the lifespan, and possible adverse effects, have not been thoroughly investigated. To evaluate the efficacy and harms of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for people with the core features (social interaction, communication, and restrictive and repetitive behaviours) of autism. To assess the effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors on non-core features of autism. In November 2022, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, eight other databases, and two trials registers. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews, and contacted authors of relevant studies. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), comparing acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g. galantamine, donepezil, or rivastigmine) of varying doses, delivered orally or via transdermal patch, either as monotherapy or adjunct therapy, with placebo. People of any age, with a clinical diagnosis of autism were eligible for inclusion. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were core features of autism and adverse effects. Secondary outcomes were language, irritability, hyperactivity, and general health and function. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. We included two RCTs (74 participants). One study was conducted in Iran, the second in the USA, although exact location in the USA is unclear. Galantamine plus risperidone versus placebo plus risperidone One study compared the effects of galantamine plus risperidone to placebo plus risperidone (40 participants, aged 4 years to 12 years). Primary and secondary outcomes of interest were measured postintervention, using subscales of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (score 0 to 3; higher scores = greater impairment). Very low-certainty evidence showed there was little to no difference between the two groups postintervention for social communication (mean difference (MD) -2.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.88 to 0.38), and restricted and repetitive behaviour (MD -0.55, 95% CI -3.47 to 2.37). Overall autism features were not assessed. Adverse events may be higher in the galantamine plus risperidone group (75%) compared with the placebo plus risperidone group (35%): odds ratio 5.57, 95% CI 1.42 to 21.86, low-certainty evidence. No serious adverse events were reported. Low-certainty evidence showed a small difference in irritability (MD -3.50, 95% CI -6.39 to -0.61), with the galantamine plus risperidone group showing a greater decline on the irritability subscale than the placebo group postintervention. There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in hyperactivity postintervention (MD -5.20, 95% CI -10.51 to 0.11). General health and function were not assessed. Donepezil versus placebo One study compared donepezil to placebo (34 participants aged 8 years to 17 years). Primary outcomes of interest were measured postintervention, using subscales of the Modified Version of The Real Life Rating Scale (scored 0 to 3; higher scores = greater impairment). Very low-certainty evidence showed no evidence of group differences immediately postintervention in overall autism features (MD 0.07, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.33), or in the autism symptom domains of social communication (MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.30), and restricted and repetitive behaviours (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.35). Significant adverse events leading to study withdrawal in at least one participant was implied in the data analysis section, but not explicitly reported. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of donepezil, compared to placebo, on the secondary outcomes of interest, including irritability (MD 1.08, 95% CI -0.41 to 2.57), hyperactivity (MD 2.60, 95% CI 0.50 to 4.70), and general health and function (MD 0.03, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.54) postintervention. Across all analyses within this comparison, we judged the evidence to be very low-certainty due to high risk of bias, and very serious imprecision (results based on one small study with wide confidence intervals). The study narratively reported adverse events for the study as a whole, rather than by treatment group. Evidence about the effectiveness of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors as a medication to improve outcomes for autistic adults is lacking, and for autistic children is very uncertain. There is a need for more evidence of improvement in outcomes of relevance to clinical care, autistic people, and their families. There are a number of ongoing studies involving acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and future updates of this review may add to the current evidence.","Child, Humans, Acetylcholine, Autism Spectrum

"37219040","A lack of efficacy of continuous theta burst stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in autism: A double blind randomized sham-controlled trial.","2023-06-01","Ni Hsing-Chang, Chen Yi-Lung, Chao Yi-Ping, Wu Chen-Te, Chen Rao-Shayn, Chou Tai-Li, Gau Susan Shur-Fen, Lin Hsiang-Yuan","Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research","Although previous open-label trials suggest the therapeutic potential of inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), methodological caveats exist. We conducted an 8-week randomized, double-blind sham-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of inhibitory continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS, a variant of rTMS) over the left DLPFC in individuals with ASD. Sixty children, adolescents and young adults (aged 8-30 years) with ASD without co-occurring intellectual disabilities were randomized to a 16-session 8-week cTBS versus sham stimulation course, with a follow-up 4 weeks after the trial. The Active group was not superior to the Sham group in any clinical or neuropsychological metrics at Week 8 or Week 12. Time effects of 8-week cTBS on symptoms and executive function were remarkable in both Active and Sham groups, with comparable response rates and effect sizes of changes in symptoms/cognition between groups. Our results from a sufficiently powered sample do not endorse the superior efficacy of cTBS over the left DLPFC to the shamed stimulation for children, adolescents and adults with ASD. These findings suggest that earlier positive open-label trial findings may be generalized by generalized/placebo effects. This highlights the urgent need for more rTMS/TBS studies with rigorous trial designs in ASD.","Young Adult, Adolescent, Child, Humans, Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, Transcranial Magnetic

Autistic youth have difficulty accessing mental health care, and this is particularly true for youth from traditionally underserved backgrounds. Providing mental health programs in schools may increase access to care for autistic youth with anxiety. The purpose of the study was to train interdisciplinary school providers to deliver school-based Facing Your Fears, a cognitive behavior therapy program for anxiety in autistic youth. Seventy-seven interdisciplinary school providers across 25 elementary/middle schools were trained by their colleagues and members of the research (train-the-trainer approach). Eighty-one students with autism or suspected autism, ages 8-14 years, were randomly assigned to either school-based Facing Your Fears or usual care. Students in school-based Facing Your Fears showed significant reductions in anxiety compared to students in usual care according to caregiver and student report. Other measures involved examining change in provider cognitive behavior therapy knowledge after training and determining how well interdisciplinary school providers were able to deliver school-based Facing Your Fears. Results indicated that interdisciplinary school providers showed significant improvements in cognitive behavior therapy knowledge after training. Interdisciplinary school providers were able to deliver most of school-based Facing Your Fears activities and with good quality. The positive outcomes in this study are encouraging. Training interdisciplinary school providers to deliver school-based Facing Your Fears may increase access to care for anxious autistic students. Future directions and limitations are discussed.","Adolescent, Humans, Anxiety, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Students,

"37165863","Parent, child, and family outcomes following Acceptance And Commitment Therapy for parents of autistic children: A randomized controlled trial.","2024-02-01","Maughan Andrea L, Lunsky Yona, Lake Johanna, Mills Jennifer S, Fung Kenneth, Steel Lee, Weiss Jonathan A","Autism : the international journal of research and practice","Parents of autistic children commonly experience difficulties with their own mental health. This study looked at the effects of a brief group-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy program, developed for parents of autistic children, youth, and adults. ACT focuses on increasing psychological flexibility, which is the ability to be mindful and accepting of difficult thoughts and experiences, shown to be important for mental wellness. Participants included 54 parents of autistic people, ages 3-34. Parents were randomly divided into two groups: a Treatment group that received the intervention right away, and a Waitlist group that completed the program after the Treatment group completed the trial. All parents filled out questionnaires right before the program began, and at 3, 7, and 17 weeks after randomization. Compared to the group that was waiting to participate in the program, parents in the Treatment group reported greater improvements in depression and family distress, and these improvements were still present 4 months later. Parents in the Treatment group also reported short-term improvements in their positive feelings and personal goals, compared to those waiting. Results showed that ACT may help improve some aspects of mental health for parents of autistic children, but further research is recommended.","Adolescent, Adult, Child, Humans, Acceptance and

"37091539","Concordance of multiple informant assessment of school-based social skills intervention and association with child outcomes: Results from a randomized trial.","2023-01-01","Tagavi Daina M, Ahlers Kaitlyn, Bravo Alice, McVey Alana J, Locke Jill","Implementation research and practice","Fidelity, or the degree to which an intervention is implemented as designed, is essential for effective implementation. There has been a growing emphasis on assessing fidelity of evidence-based practices for autistic children in schools. Fidelity measurement should be multidimensional and focus on core intervention components and assess their link with program outcomes. This study evaluated the relation between intervention fidelity ratings from multiple sources, tested the relation between fidelity ratings and child outcomes, and determined the relations between core intervention components and child outcomes in a study of an evidence-based psychosocial intervention designed to promote inclusion of autistic children at school, Remaking Recess. This study extends from a larger randomized controlled trial examining the effect of implementation support on Remaking Recess fidelity and child outcomes. Schools were randomized to receive the intervention or the intervention plus implementation support. Observers, intervention coaches, and school personnel completed fidelity measures to rate completion and quality of intervention delivery. A measure of peer engagement served as the child outcome. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to determine concordance between raters. Two sets of hierarchical linear models were conducted using fidelity indices as predictors of peer engagement. Coach- and self-rated completion and quality scores, observer- and self-rated quality scores, and observer- and coach-rated quality fidelity scores were significantly correlated. Higher observer-rated completion and quality fidelity scores were predictors of higher peer engagement scores. No single intervention component emerged as a significant predictor of peer engagement. This study demonstrates the importance of using a multidimensional approach for measuring fidelity, testing the link between fidelity and child outcomes, and examining how core intervention components may be associated with child outcomes. Future research should clarify how to improve multi-informant reports to provide ""good enough"" ratings of fidelity that provide meaningful information about outcomes in community settings. Fidelity is defined as how closely an intervention is administered in the way the creators intended. Fidelity is important because it allows researchers to determine what exactly is leading to changes. In recent years, there has been an interest in examining fidelity of interventions for autistic children who receive services in school. This study looked at the relationship between fidelity ratings from multiple individuals, the relationship between fidelity and child outcomes, and the relationship between individual intervention component and child changes in a study of Remaking Recess, an intervention for autistic children at school. Schools were randomly selected to receive the intervention only or the intervention plus implementation support from the research team. Observers, intervention coaches, and individuals delivering the intervention themselves completed fidelity measures. Child engagement with peers was measured before and after the intervention. Several measures of self-, coach-, and observer-report fidelity were associated with each other. Higher observer-reported fidelity was associated with higher child peer engagement scores. No single intervention step was linked to child peer engagement and both treatment groups had similar outcomes in terms of fidelity. This study shows the importance of having multiple raters assess different parts of intervention fidelity, looking at the link between fidelity and child outcomes, and seeing how individual intervention steps may be related to outcomes. Future research should aim to find out which types of fidelity ratings are ""good enough"" to lead to positive changes following treatment so that those aspects can be used and targeted in the

"36901415","Third-Generation Behavioural Therapies in the Context of Neurodevelopmental Problems and Intellectual Disabilities: A Randomised Clinical Trial with Parents.","2023-03-01","Lobato David, Montesinos Francisco, Polín Eduardo, Cáliz Saray","International journal of environmental research and public health","The purpose of this study was to examine how 14 parents of children with autism and intellectual impairments responded to an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)-based psychological flexibility intervention programme. A randomised clinical trial was conducted. Parents were randomly assigned to the training programme group (<i>n</i> = 8) or waiting list group (<i>n</i> = 6). The treatment effect was measured using the 6-PAQ, PSS-14, GHQ-12, and WBSI questionnaires. Changes in interactions were assessed through self-recording, including a baseline to observe the previous functioning. Measures were taken before and after the application of the intervention programme and three months later. After that, the control group was switched to the psychological flexibility programme condition. After the programme's implementation, we could see a reduction in stress and the tendency to suppress unwanted private events. The impacts also appeared to apply to family interactions, resulting in a rise in positive interactions and a decrease in unfavourable ones. The results led us to think about the importance of psychological flexibility for the parents of children with chronic conditions, facilitating a reduction in the emotional impact derived from

"36847894","Examining the Relationship Between Anxiety Severity and Autism-Related Challenges During Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Children with Autism.","2024-05-01","Fuselier Madeleine N, Guzick Andrew G, Bakhshaie Jafar, Wood Jeffrey J, Kendall Philip C, Kerns Connor M, Small Brent J, Goodman Wayne K, Storch Eric A","Journal of autism and developmental disorders","Using data from a randomized clinical trial evaluating cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for children with autism and co-occurring anxiety, this study examined the relationship between autism features and anxiety symptoms throughout CBT. Two multilevel mediation analyses were run which examined the mediating role of changes in anxiety for changes in two core features of autism, (a) repetitive and restrictive behaviors (RRBs) and (b) social communication/interaction impairments, between pre- and post-treatment. Indirect effects between time and autism characteristics were significant for both models, indicating that as anxiety changes, so do RRBs and social communication/interaction as the outcomes respectively. Findings suggest a bidirectional relationship between anxiety and autism features. Implications of these findings are discussed.","Humans, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Male, Female, Child, Anxiety, Autistic Disorder, Treatment Outcome, Severity of Illness Index, Child, Preschool,

"36638598","Lack of effects of four-week theta burst stimulation on white matter macro/microstructure in children and adolescents with autism.","2023-01-01","Ni Hsing-Chang, Chao Yi-Ping, Tseng Rung-Yu, Wu Chen-Te, Cocchi Luca, Chou Tai-Li, Chen Rou-Shayn, Gau Susan Shur-Fen, Yeh Chun-Hung, Lin Hsiang-Yuan","NeuroImage. Clinical","Following the published behavioral and cognitive results of this single-blind parallel sham-controlled randomized clinical trial, the current study aimed to explore the impact of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS), a variant of excitatory transcranial magnetic stimulation, over the bilateral posterior superior temporal sulci (pSTS) on white matter macro/microstructure in intellectually able children and adolescents with autism. Participants were randomized and blindly received active or sham iTBS for 4 weeks (the single-blind sham-controlled phase). Then, all participants continued to receive active iTBS for another 4 weeks (the open-label phase). The clinical results were published elsewhere. Here, we present diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data on potential changes in white matter measures after iTBS. Twenty-two participants in Active-Active group and 27 participants in Sham-Active group underwent multi-shell high angular resolution diffusion imaging (64-direction for b = 2000 & 1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>, respectively) at baseline, week 4, and week 8. With longitudinal fixel-based analysis, we found no white matter changes following iTBS from baseline to week 4 (a null treatment by time interaction and a null within-group paired comparison in the Active-Active group), nor from baseline to week 8 (null within-group paired comparisons in both Active-Active and Sham-Active groups). As for the brain-symptoms relationship, we did not find baseline white matter metrics associated with symptom changes at week 4 in either group. Our results raise the question of what the minimal cumulative stimulation dose required to induce the white matter plasticity is.","Humans, Adolescent, Child, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Autistic Disorder, Single-Blind Method, Theta Rhythm, Brain","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36638598","Department of Psychiatry, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Institute for Radiological Research, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.; Clinical Brain Networks Group, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.; Deparment of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan.; Graduate Institute of Brain and Mind Sciences, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Psychiatry, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Institute for Radiological Research, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.

"36576640","Anger Outbursts in Youth with ASD and Anxiety: Phenomenology and Relationship with Family Accommodation.","2024-10-01","Townsend Allie N, Guzick Andrew G, Hertz Alyssa G, Kerns Connor M, Goodman Wayne K, Berry Leandra N, Kendall Philip C, Wood Jeffrey J, Storch Eric A","Child psychiatry and human development","Anger outbursts (AO) are associated with severe symptoms, impairment and poorer treatment outcomes for anxious children, though limited research has examined AO in youth with co-occurring autism and anxiety disorders. This study examined AO in children with autism and anxiety by evaluating clinical characteristics, family accommodation, and changes in AO following anxiety-focused treatment. The sample comprised 167 youth with autism and anxiety enrolled in a multi-site randomized clinical trial comparing standard care CBT for anxiety, CBT adapted for youth with autism, and usual care. Most participants (60%) had AO, which contributed to impairment above and beyond anxiety and autism. AO impacted functional impairment indirectly through a pathway of parental accommodation. AO reduced with anxiety-focused treatment. Findings highlight that AO are common in this population and uniquely contribute to functional impairment, indicating a need for direct targeting in treatment.","Humans, Male, Female, Child, Adolescent, Anger, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Anxiety Disorders, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Family, Anxiety","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36576640","Department of Psychology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Baylor College of Medicine, 1977 Butler Blvd, Houston, TX, USA.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Baylor College of Medicine, 1977 Butler Blvd, Houston, TX, USA.

Autistic children (5-13 years) with sleep problems were randomised to the Sleeping Sound intervention or Treatment as Usual (TAU). At 12-month follow-up (n = 150), caregivers of children in the Sleeping Sound group reported greater reduction in child sleep problems compared to TAU (p < .001, effect size: - 0.4). The long-term benefits of the intervention were greater for children taking sleep medication, children of parents who were not experiencing psychological distress, and children with greater autism severity. The Sleeping Sound intervention demonstrated sustained improvements in child sleep. Identified moderators may inform treatment by indicating which subgroups may benefit from further support.","Child, Humans, Autistic Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Sleep, Sleep

Integrating a social-humanoid robot within the standard clinical treatment has been proven promising. The main aim of this randomised controlled study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a robot-assisted psychosocial intervention and the secondary aim was to investigate potential differences between a robot-assisted intervention group and a control group receiving intervention by humans only. The analysis of the results showed that robot-assisted intervention could be beneficial by improving children's psychosocial skills. This improvement was highlighted by neuropsychological testing and parent reporting. Group comparison only presented minimal statistically significant differences. The study underpins the potential of robot-assisted interventions to augment standard care.","Child, Humans, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Psychosocial Intervention, Robotics, Social Interaction, Research Design","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36331688","""Praxis"" Novel Consulting and Therapy Centre for Children, Kavala, Greece.; Division of Child Neurology and Metabolic Disorders, 4th Department of Paediatrics, AUTH, Papageorgiou General Hospital, Periferiaki Odos, N.

"36291419","Managing Autism Spectrum Disorder in the Face of Pandemic Using Internet-Based Parent-Mediated Interventions: A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials.","2022-09-28","Yosep Iyus, Prayogo Stephanie Amabella, Kohar Kelvin, Andrew Hubert, Mardhiyah Ai, Amirah Shakira, Maulana Sidik","Children (Basel, Switzerland)","ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is primarily treated with psychosocial intervention. However, it is costly and requires extensive resources to be effective. This inaccessibility is also further worsened by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, making the shift to a digital approach a sensible option. Among the available ASD therapies, parent-mediated interventions (PMIs) have a broad application and lower implementation cost. Hence, this systematic review aims to evaluate the potential that telehealth-based PMI holds and explore its feasibility throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. To build up this study, a systematic search through PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, Wiley, and Cochrane was performed until 14 January 2021. Using the preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines, we ultimately included six studies in the review. Each study was evaluated utilizing the Cochrane Risk of Bias (ROB)-2 tool. Generally, parents' outcomes (knowledge, satisfaction, and compliance) were higher in intervention group (E-learning) compared to control (standard treatment or wait-list). Children also showed some improvements in social skill, communication skill, and intelligence after receiving the treatment. In addition, coaching or therapist sessions were found to be crucial as adjuvant to support parents during the intervention. In conclusion, internet-based parent-mediated interventions are promising and recommended for managing ASD patients, in the face of pandemic. However, more variety in study locations is also needed, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, to tackle the knowledge and clinical application gap. Further research should be conducted with a uniform measurement tool to achieve the same perception and reliable pooled analysis.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36291419","Department of

"36282407","Impact of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on the directed connectivity of autism EEG signals: a pilot study.","2022-12-01","Kang Jiannan, Li Xiaoli, Casanova Manuel F, Sokhadze Estate M, Geng Xinling","Medical & biological engineering & computing","To compare the differences in directed connectivity between typically developing (TD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) children and identify the potential effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on brain connectivity and behavior of children with ASD; 26 TD children (18 males/8 females; the average age was 6.34 ± 0.45) and 30 ASD children (21 males/9 females; the average age was 6.42 ± 0.17) participated in the experiment. ASD children were divided randomly into an experimental group and a control group. The experimental group received 18 rTMS sessions (twice a week for nine weeks), whereas the control group received the same procedures with sham stimulation. Directed transfer function (DTF) was used to calculate the effective connectivity as a way of investigating differences between ASD and TD children while simultaneously evaluating the effectiveness of rTMS for ASD. The results illustrate that the DTF of TD children in the frontal lobe (Fp1, Fp2, F7, F8) and temporal lobe (T7, T8) is higher than that of ASD children in all frequency bands; however, the DTF of ASD children is higher than TD in the midline (Fz, Cz), central lobe (C3, C4), and parietal lobe (P3, P4). In the experimental group of ASD children, the effective connectivity decreased from O1 to T7 and from P7 to Fp1 in the alpha band and from Pz to T8 in the gamma band after stimulation. Significant changes in Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) scores were also found in social behaviors. Effective connectivity derived from DTF distinguishes ASD from TD children. rTMS provides changes in connectivity and behavior, suggesting its potential use as a viable treatment option for ASD individuals.","Child, Male, Female, Humans, Child, Preschool, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Autistic Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Pilot Projects, Brain,

"36279220","Change during cognitive and exposure phases of cognitive-behavioral therapy for autistic youth with anxiety disorders.","2022-09-01","Guzick Andrew G, Schneider Sophie C, Kendall Philip C, Wood Jeffrey J, Kerns Connor M, Small Brent J, Park Ye Eun, Cepeda Sandra L, Storch Eric A","Journal of consulting and clinical psychology","To evaluate improvement during the (a) cognitive and (b) exposure therapy phases of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for autistic youth with anxiety disorders. Participants were 148 autistic youth (aged 7-13; 77% male; 64% White) with clinically significant anxiety who were randomized to standard or adapted CBT. Clinician-rated anxiety severity was recorded at each appointment. Trajectories of change during (a) the cognitive phase and (b) the exposure phase of treatment were analyzed using piecewise multilevel modeling. Compared to the psychoeducation and cognitive therapy phases, the exposure phase corresponded with significantly more rapid symptom reduction, b = -.11, 95% CI [-.13, -.071]. This finding was true for standard CBT, which included nine sessions prior to exposure initiation (on average), as well as for CBT personalized for autistic youth, which introduced exposure following the fifth session (on average). In contrast, compared with improvements during initial psychoeducation sessions, the introduction of cognitive skills corresponded with significantly slower symptom reduction, b = .066, 95% CI [.020, .11]. This finding was also true for both adapted and standard CBT. Results underscore the central role of exposure in the treatment of anxiety among autistic youth and question the utility of cognitive strategies without subsequent practice of these skills during exposure. Assuming a working relationship, therapists should consider moving through the preexposure coping phase of CBT quickly. Future research should evaluate the extent to which exposure can maintain its potency while minimizing coping skill preparation.

Step 1 included an open trial of parent-led, therapist-guided bibliotherapy. Step 2 was family-based CBT for those who did not respond to Step 1 or maintenance for those who did. Eighteen participants (28%) who completed Step 1 responded. Responders reported significantly lower pre-treatment anxiety, internalizing symptoms, and functional impairment than non-responders. After Steps 1 and 2, 80% of completers (55% intent-to-treat) were responders. Anxiety, impairment, and ASD-related impairments significantly improved. Youth in maintenance experienced faster improvement through post-treatment, though there were no group differences at 3-month-follow-up. A stepped approach may help some individuals in Step 1, particularly those who are less anxious.","Adolescent, Child, Humans, Anxiety, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Cognitive Behavioral

"36201889","Acceptability of a behavioural sleep intervention for autistic children: A qualitative evaluation of Sleeping Sound.","2022-12-01","Pattison Emily, Mantilla Ana, Fuller-Tyszkiewicz Matthew, Marks Deborah, Sciberras Emma, McGillivray Jane, Papadopoulos Nicole, Rinehart Nicole","Sleep medicine","The aim of the current study was to evaluate parental perceptions of the acceptability of a brief behavioural sleep intervention for autistic children (aged 5-13 years) using the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA). Qualitative data were collected during a large randomised controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of the Sleeping Sound intervention: 123 families were randomised to the intervention group, of which 115 (93%) completed at least one intervention session and 82 (67%) provided qualitative evaluation data in the 3-month follow-up survey. Consultation records from intervention sessions and parent surveys were qualitatively analysed post hoc using a hybrid approach to thematic analysis. Findings were categorised under the seven themes of the TFA (affective attitude, burden, ethicality, intervention coherence, opportunity costs, perceived effectiveness, self-efficacy) in addition to three themes that were defined following inductive and deductive coding (barriers to implementation, facilitators to implementation, suggestions for improvement). Participants spoke positively about their experience participating in the intervention and perceived the intervention to be appropriate and effective. Most parents (95.5%) reported that they would recommend the Sleeping Sound intervention to other families of autistic children. Barriers to implementation included child and parent anxiety, child health problems, parental preferences, family circumstances, and other (e.g., school holidays). Facilitators to implementation included family support and consistency with strategies. The Sleeping Sound intervention was considered acceptable to parents of autistic children as evidenced by largely positive feedback regarding their experience. The results highlighted areas for improvement which can be used to inform future iterations of the intervention.","Child, Humans, Autistic Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Parents, Sleep, Surveys and Questionnaires","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36201889","School of Psychology, Faculty of Health, Deakin University, 1 Gheringhap Street, Geelong, Victoria, 3220, Australia; Murdoch Children's Research Institute, 50 Flemington Road, Parkville, Victoria, 3052, Australia; Department of Paediatrics, University of Melbourne, Grattan Street, Parkville, Victoria, 3010, Australia.; Royal Children's Hospital, 50 Flemington Road, Parkville, Victoria, 3052, Australia.; School of Psychology, Faculty of Health, Deakin University, 1 Gheringhap Street, Geelong, Victoria, 3220, Australia.

"36161554","Treatment Response of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Intellectually Capable Youth and Young Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","2023-12-01","Smith Joshua R, DiSalvo Maura, Green Allison, Ceranoglu Tolga Atilla, Anteraper Sheeba Arnold, Croarkin Paul, Joshi Gagan","Neuropsychology review","To examine current clinical research on the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in the treatment of pediatric and young adult autism spectrum disorder in intellectually capable persons (IC-ASD). We searched peer-reviewed international literature to identify clinical trials investigating TMS as a treatment for behavioral and cognitive symptoms of IC-ASD. We identified sixteen studies and were able to conduct a meta-analysis on twelve of these studies. Seven were open-label or used neurotypical controls for baseline cognitive data, and nine were controlled trials. In the latter, waitlist control groups were often used over sham TMS. Only one study conducted a randomized, parallel, double-blind, and sham controlled trial. Favorable safety data was reported in low frequency repetitive TMS, high frequency repetitive TMS, and intermittent theta burst studies. Compared to TMS research of other neuropsychiatric conditions, significantly lower total TMS pulses were delivered in treatment and neuronavigation was not regularly utilized. Quantitatively, our multivariate meta-analysis results report improvement in cognitive outcomes (pooled Hedges' g = 0.735, 95% CI = 0.242, 1.228; p = 0.009) and primarily Criterion B symptomology of IC-ASD (pooled Hedges' g = 0.435, 95% CI = 0.359, 0.511; p < 0.001) with low frequency repetitive TMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The results of our systematic review and meta-analysis data indicate that TMS may offer a promising and safe treatment option for pediatric and young adult patients with IC-ASD. However, future work should include use of neuronavigation software, theta burst protocols, targeting of various brain regions, and robust study design before clinical recommendations can be made.","Humans, Adolescent, Young Adult, Child, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Research Design, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36161554","Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital, 55 Fruit Street, Boston, MA, 02114, USA.; Clinical and Research Programs in Pediatric Psychopharmacology, and Adult ADHD, Massachusetts General Hospital, 55 Fruit Street, Boston, MA, 02114, USA.; Department of Psychiatry and Psychology, Mayo Clinic, 1216 2nd Street Southwest, Rochester, MN, 55902, USA.; Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Vanderbilt University Medical Center at Village of Vanderbilt, 1500 21st Avenue South, Suite 2200, Nashville, TN, 37212, USA.

"36142909","Randomized Double-Blind Crossover Study for Evaluating a Probiotic Mixture on Gastrointestinal and Behavioral Symptoms of Autistic Children.","2022-09-06","Guidetti Cristina, Salvini Elena, Viri Maurizio, Deidda Francesca, Amoruso Angela, Visciglia Annalisa, Drago Lorenzo, Calgaro Matteo, Vitulo Nicola, Pane Marco, Caucino Anna Claudia","Journal of clinical medicine","Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) represent a diagnostic challenge with a still partially uncertain etiology, in which genetic and environmental factors have now been assessed. Among the hypotheses underlying the involvement of biological and environmental factors, the gut-brain axis is of particular interest in autism spectrum disorders. Several studies have highlighted the related incidence of particular gastrointestinal symptoms (GISs) in children suffering from ASDs. Probiotics have shown success in treating several gastrointestinal dysbiotic disorders; therefore, it is plausible to investigate whether they can alleviate behavioral symptoms as well. On these bases, a randomized double-blind crossover study with a placebo was conducted, evaluating the effects of a mixture of probiotics in a group of 61 subjects aged between 24 months and 16 years old with a diagnosis of ASD. Behavioral evaluation was performed through the administration of a questionnaire including a Parenting Stress Index (PSI) test and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS). The Psycho-Educational Profile and the Autism Spectrum Rating Scale (ASRS) were also evaluated. Microbial composition analyses of fecal samples of the two groups was also performed. The study showed significant improvements in GISs, communication skills, maladaptive behaviors, and perceived parental stress level after the administration of probiotics. Microbiome alpha diversity was comparable between treatment arms and no significant differences were found, although beta diversity results were significantly different in the treatment group between T0 and T1 time points. <i>Streptococcus thermophilus</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i>, <i>Limosilactobacillus fermentum</i>, and <i>Ligilactobacillus salivarius</i> species were identified as some of the most discriminant taxa positively associated with T1 samples.

"36053934","The effectiveness of an attention-based intervention for school-aged autistic children with anger regulating problems: A randomized controlled trial.","2022-10-01","Clifford Pamela, Gevers Carolien, Jonkman Kim M, Boer Frits, Begeer Sander","Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research","Anger regulation is a challenge for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We investigated if attention-based cognitive behavioral treatment, based on mindfulness cognitive therapy (MBCT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), reduces aggressive behavior and improves anger coping in school-aged autistic children (n = 51). Children were randomized to an active-control or a treatment condition. The treatment included nine weekly sessions attention-based individual therapy. Parents in both conditions received three weekly psychoeducation group sessions to heighten awareness of expressed emotion (EE). For aggressive behavior, treatment reduced temper tantrums and arguing. No effect was found on destroying things and physical violence. For anger coping, treatment increased adaptive coping strategies of diffusion and social support seeking, but had no effect on assertion, rumination, and maladaptive coping direct anger out and avoidance. Treatment did not impact secondary outcome measures concerning children's quality of life (QoL) and parental stress-levels and psychological well-being. In conclusion, school-aged autistic children are able to acquire self-regulation skills reducing temper tantrums and arguing and increasing the use of adaptive anger coping strategies. The intervention shows potential to improve behavior and regulation, but little transfer to other domains. Limitations and future directions involving the child's social environment, including parents, siblings, and teachers are discussed. LAY SUMMARY: Children on the autism spectrum often show aggressive behavior. Treatment can train children to be more aware of their emotions. This study found that this can help reducing temper tantrums and arguing and increasing some coping skills, though no impact was found on several other domains of aggression and coping.","Anger,

"35958966","Use of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Child Psychiatry.","2022-01-01","Bejenaru Anca Maria, Malhi Narpinder Kaur","Innovations in clinical neuroscience","Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive diagnostic and therapeutic technique that has showed benefits in various psychiatric disorders. Although there is a large body of literature available on its use in adult populations, existing research in pediatric populations is very limited. Current research has primarily focused on its use in adolescent treatment-resistant depression. However, recently, rTMS has gained attention among researchers to find its utility in other neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), tics, and psychosis. There is a lack of systematic data on the safety of rTMS in children and adolescents. The aim of this article was to present an overview of the existing literature on the use of rTMS in children and adolescents and examine the relevant safety considerations. We conducted a literature review of the English literature in PubMed on TMS in children and adolescents, using comprehensive search terms and expanding our review to include sources cited by these reports. We reviewed the application of rTMS in psychiatric disorders in the pediatric population. rTMS has been used for depression and anxiety disorders, OCD, ADHD, Tourette syndrome/tics, ASD, and schizophrenia, with variable results. rTMS is a promising treatment in children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders, although larger, sham-controlled, randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) will be required to definitely demonstrate efficacy, as well as to support a safety profile.",,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35958966","Drs.

"35869533","REACH-ASD: a UK randomised controlled trial of a new post-diagnostic psycho-education and acceptance and commitment therapy programme against treatment-as-usual for improving the mental health and adjustment of caregivers of children recently diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.","2022-07-22","Leadbitter Kathy, Smallman Richard, James Kirsty, Shields Gemma, Ellis Ceri, Langhorne Sophie, Harrison Louisa, Hackett Latha, Dunkerley Alison, Kroll Leo, Davies Linda, Emsley Richard, Bee Penny, Green Jonathan,  ","Trials","Autism is a neurodevelopmental disability affecting over 1% of UK children. The period following a child's autism diagnosis can present real challenges in adaptation for families. Twenty to 50% of caregivers show clinically significant levels of mental health need within the post-diagnostic period and on an ongoing basis. Best practice guidelines recommend timely post-diagnostic family support. Current provision is patchy, largely unevidenced, and a source of dissatisfaction for both families and professionals. There is a pressing need for an evidenced programme of post-diagnostic support focusing on caregiver mental health and adjustment, alongside autism psycho-education. This trial tests the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a new brief manualised psychosocial intervention designed to address this gap. This is a multi-centre two-parallel-group single (researcher)-blinded randomised controlled trial of the Empower-Autism programme plus treatment-as-usual versus usual local post-diagnostic offer plus treatment-as-usual. Caregivers of children aged 2-15 years with a recent autism diagnosis will be recruited from North West England NHS or local authority centres. Randomisation is individually by child, with one ""index"" caregiver per child, stratified by centre, using 2:1 randomisation ratio to assist recruitment and timely intervention. Empower-Autism is a group-based, manualised, post-diagnostic programme that combines autism psycho-education and psychotherapeutic components based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy to support caregiver mental health, stress management and adjustment to their child's diagnosis. The comparator is any usual local group-based post-diagnostic psycho-education offer. Receipt of services will be specified through health economic data. caregiver mental health (General Health Questionnaire-30) at 52-week follow-up. key caregiver measures (wellbeing, self-efficacy, adjustment, autism knowledge) at 12-, 26- and 52-week follow-up and family and child outcomes (wellbeing and functioning) at 52-week endpoint. N=380 (approximately 253 intervention/127 treatment-as-usual). Primary analysis will follow intention-to-treat principles using linear mixed models with random intercepts for group membership and repeated measures. Cost-effectiveness acceptability analyses will be over 52 weeks, with decision modelling to extrapolate to longer time periods. If effective, this new approach will fill a key gap in the provision of evidence-based care pathways for autistic children and their families. ISRCTN 45412843 .

"35790873","Efficacy of psychosocial interventions for Autism spectrum disorder: an umbrella review.","2022-09-01","Gosling Corentin J, Cartigny Ariane, Mellier Baptiste C, Solanes Aleix, Radua Joaquim, Delorme Richard","Molecular psychiatry","The wide range of psychosocial interventions designed to assist people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) makes it challenging to compile and hierarchize the scientific evidence that supports the efficacy of these interventions. Thus, we performed an umbrella review of published meta-analyses of controlled clinical trials that investigated the efficacy of psychosocial interventions on both core and related ASD symptoms. Each meta-analysis that was identified was re-estimated using a random-effects model with a restricted maximum likelihood estimator. The methodological quality of included meta-analyses was critically appraised and the credibility of the evidence was assessed algorithmically according to criteria adapted for the purpose of this study. We identified a total of 128 meta-analyses derived from 44 reports. More than half of the non-overlapping meta-analyses were nominally statistically significant and/or displayed a moderate-to-large pooled effect size that favored the psychosocial interventions. The assessment of the credibility of evidence pointed out that the efficacy of early intensive behavioral interventions, developmental interventions, naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions, and parent-mediated interventions was supported by suggestive evidence on at least one outcome in preschool children. Possible outcomes included social communication deficits, global cognitive abilities, and adaptive behaviors. Results also revealed highly suggestive indications that parent-mediated interventions improved disruptive behaviors in early school-aged children. The efficacy of social skills groups was supported by suggestive evidence for improving social communication deficits and overall ASD symptoms in school-aged children and adolescents. Only four meta-analyses had a statistically significant pooled effect size in a sensitivity analysis restricted to randomized controlled trials at low risk of detection bias. This umbrella review confirmed that several psychosocial interventions show promise for improving symptoms related to ASD at different stages of life. However, additional well-designed randomized controlled trials are still required to produce a clearer picture of the efficacy of these interventions. To facilitate the dissemination of scientific knowledge about psychosocial interventions for individuals with ASD, we built an open-access and interactive website that shares the information collected and the results generated during this umbrella review.

We conducted an umbrella review (PubMed/Cochrane Library/PsycINFO-04-Jul-2021, PROSPERO/CRD42020158827) for meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on deep brain stimulation (DBS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), electro-convulsive therapy (ECT), and others. Co-primary outcomes were standardized mean differences (SMD) of disease-specific symptoms, and acceptability (for all-cause discontinuation). Evidence was assessed with AMSTAR/AMSTAR-Content/GRADE. We selected 102 meta-analyses. Effective interventions compared to sham were in depressive disorders: ECT (SMD=0.91/GRADE=moderate), TMS (SMD=0.51/GRADE=moderate), tDCS (SMD=0.46/GRADE=low), DBS (SMD=0.42/GRADE=very low), light therapy (SMD=0.41/GRADE=low); schizophrenia: ECT (SMD=0.88/GRADE=moderate), tDCS (SMD=0.45/GRADE=very low), TMS (prefrontal theta-burst, SMD=0.58/GRADE=low; left-temporoparietal, SMD=0.42/GRADE=low); substance use disorder: TMS (high frequency-dorsolateral-prefrontal-deep (SMD=1.16/GRADE=moderate), high frequency-left dorsolateral-prefrontal (SMD=0.77/GRADE=very low); OCD: DBS (SMD=0.89/GRADE=moderate), TMS (SMD=0.64/GRADE=very low); PTSD: TMS (SMD=0.46/GRADE=moderate); generalized anxiety disorder: TMS (SMD=0.68/GRADE=low); ADHD: tDCS (SMD=0.23/GRADE=moderate); autism: tDCS (SMD=0.97/GRADE=very low). No significant differences for acceptability emerged. Median AMSTAR/AMSTAR-Content was 8/2 (suggesting high-quality meta-analyses/low-quality RCTs), GRADE low. Despite limited certainty, biological non-pharmacological interventions are effective and safe for numerous mental conditions. Results inform future research, and guidelines.

"35689137","Pilot Randomized Control Trial of an App-Based CBT Program for Reducing Anxiety in Individuals with ASD without Intellectual Disability.","2023-04-01","Yang Yoon Jung, Chung Kyong-Mee","Journal of autism and developmental disorders","This study developed and tested the effectiveness of an app-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program in alleviating anxiety among adolescents and adults with autism without co-occurring intellectual disability. Thirty participants from 15 to 35 years old were randomly assigned to either the intervention or waitlist control group, and self- and caregiver proxy report questionnaires were administered, accompanied by direct behavior observation before and after the intervention period. There was a significant decrease in anxiety level, an increase in positive affect, and a decline in stereotypic behaviors, hyperactivity, noncompliance, and inappropriate speech in proxy reports for the intervention group, compared to the control group. A significant rise in passive response in the direct observation was also seen in the intervention group.","Adult, Adolescent, Humans, Young Adult, Intellectual Disability, Mobile Applications, Pilot

"35488976","A Preliminary Evaluation of a Brief Behavioral Parent Training for Challenging Behavior in Autism Spectrum Disorder.","2023-08-01","Rohacek Ashley, Baxter Emily L, Sullivan William E, Roane Henry S, Antshel Kevin M","Journal of autism and developmental disorders","Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often exhibit challenging behaviors. Existing behavioral parent trainings (BPT) address ASD symptomology, but are lengthy and associated with significant attrition. In the current pilot study, a longitudinal randomized controlled trial was used to evaluate a novel brief BPT targeting caregivers of children with ASD ages 5-9. The 6-session BPT, delivered in a group format, focused on high-frequency challenging behaviors (e.g., problem behaviors, feeding and sleep issues). Caregivers who received BPT (n = 29), relative to an active control (psychoeducation/supportive therapy; n = 9), reported higher treatment satisfaction and acceptability. Challenging behaviors were reduced in the BPT and active control groups. The novel BPT was a feasible and acceptable intervention to target challenging behaviors in youth with ASD.","Child, Adolescent, Humans, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Pilot Projects, Problem Behavior,

"35244056","Traditional Chinese medicine intervention for autism spectrum disorders: A protocol for systematic review and network meta-analysis.","2022-03-04","Feng Xiang, Li Keshang, Jiang Quanrui, Zhang Yuxing, Gong Zhichao, Zhi Hui, Yu Jun, Li Wu, Li Jiangshan","Medicine","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in social communication, social interaction, and restrictive or repetitive behaviors. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used in the clinical management of ASD, especially in mainland China, where studies have shown promising efficacy. However, this remains to be further explored and clarified. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of conventional treatment-based TCM interventions for ASD. The study will be conducted from January 2022, and the following electronic databases will be searched: China Biological Medicine Database, Chinese Scientific Journals Database, Wan Fang database, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, and EMBASE Database. Only randomized controlled trials of TCM interventions for ASD will be included. The Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale, Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised, and Childhood Autism Rating Scale will be the primary outcome indicators. The methodological quality of this Bayesian-based network meta-analysis will be performed using the ""Risk of Bias"" tool. Stata 14.0 and WinBUGS 1.4.3 will be used to analyze the data. In addition, assessment of heterogeneity, inconsistency, subgroups, sensitivity, and publication bias will be conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration's tools. The results of this study will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. This study will help patients recover better, provide clinical evidence for practitioners, and promote the use of TCM in ASD interventions.","Autism Spectrum Disorder, Bayes Theorem, Child, Humans,

"35239083","Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Group Intervention for Parents of Children with Disabilities (Navigator ACT): An Open Feasibility Trial.","2023-05-01","Holmberg Bergman T, Renhorn E, Berg B, Lappalainen P, Ghaderi A, Hirvikoski T","Journal of autism and developmental disorders","Parents of children with autism spectrum disorder and other disabilities report high levels of distress, but systematically evaluated interventions are few. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a novel, manualized Acceptance and Commitment Therapy group intervention (Navigator ACT) in a sample of 94 parents of children with disabilities. Feasibility was measured by treatment completion, credibility, and satisfaction, and preliminary outcomes by using self-rating scales administered at the baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up. The results imply the intervention is feasible in the context of Swedish outpatient habilitation services. A preliminary analysis of the outcome measures suggests that parents experienced significant improvements in well-being. The results indicate that the treatment is feasible and should be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial.","Child, Humans, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Children

"35181532","Neurophysiological and behavioral effects of multisession prefrontal tDCS and concurrent cognitive remediation training in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD): A double-blind, randomized controlled fNIRS study.","2022-01-01","Han Yvonne M Y, Chan Melody M Y, Shea Caroline K S, Lai Oscar Long-Hin, Krishnamurthy Karthikeyan, Cheung Mei-Chun, Chan Agnes S","Brain stimulation","The clinical effects and neurophysiological mechanisms of prefrontal tDCS and concurrent cognitive remediation training in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain unclear. This two-armed, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial aimed to investigate the beneficial effects of tDCS combined with concurrent cognitive remediation training on adolescents and young adults with ASD. Participants were randomly assigned to either active or sham tDCS groups and received 1.5 mA prefrontal tDCS with left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) cathode placement and right supraorbital region anode placement for 20 minutes over two consecutive weeks. tDCS was delivered concurrently with a computerized cognitive remediation training program. Social functioning and its underlying cognitive processes, as well as prefrontal resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC), were measured. The results from 41 participants indicated that multisession prefrontal tDCS, compared to sham tDCS, significantly enhanced the social functioning of ASD individuals [F(1,39) = 4.75, p = .035, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.11]. This improvement was associated with enhanced emotion recognition [F(1,39) = 8.34, p = .006, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.18] and cognitive flexibility [F(1,39) = 4.91, p = .033, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.11]. Specifically, this tDCS protocol optimized information processing efficiency [F(1,39) = 4.43, p = .042, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.10], and the optimization showed a trend to be associated with enhanced rsFC in the right medial prefrontal cortex (ρ = 0.339, pFDR = .083). Multisession tDCS with left dlPFC cathode placement and right supraorbital region anode placement paired with concurrent cognitive remediation training promoted social functioning in individuals with ASD. This appeared to be associated with the enhancement of the functional connectivity of the right medial PFC, a major hub for flexible social information processing, allowing these individuals to process information more efficiently in response to different social situations.

"35120753","[Therapeutic approaches for sleep and rhythms disorders in children with ASD].","2022-06-01","Schröder C M, Broquère M A, Claustrat B, Delorme R, Franco P, Lecendreux M, Tordjman S","L'Encephale","Sleep disturbances are extremely common (40-86%) in children and adolescents, especially those with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and are often among the first symptoms identified by parents at a very early stage of their child's development. These abnormalities are among the main parental concerns when having a child with ASD and have a significant impact on the quality of life of patients, their parents, and more broadly their siblings. Sleep disorders are essentially abnormalities of the sleep-wake rhythm - primarily sleep onset insomnia or nocturnal awakenings (with difficulty falling back to sleep). These disturbances can be accompanied by other sleep disorders, requiring notably a systematic elimination of the presence of a sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome - to ensure a personalized and efficient therapeutic approach. Physiologically, the determinants of these sleep disorders are poorly understood, even though several studies point to a significant decrease in melatonin synthesis in people with ASD. Melatonin is a hormone that facilitates falling asleep and maintaining sleep and is also involved in the endogenous synchronization of internal biological clocks. However, the causal factors of this decrease in melatonin synthesis are largely unknown, involving to a small extent the genes involved in melatonin synthesis pathway. The treatment of sleep disorders is relatively systematic: after eliminating other specific sleep disorders associated with the complaint of insomnia, as well as other possible associated comorbidities (such as seizures), a global and graduated therapeutic approach must be put in place. This treatment will be non-pharmacological as a first line, then pharmacological as a second line. A number of non-pharmacological treatment strategies for sleep disorders in typically developing children and adolescents, as well as those with ASD, have been shown to be effective. This treatment requires a combination of: 1) parental education to promote sleep development; 2) setting up bedtime rituals adapted to the child's age and particularities; 3) specific behavioral strategies including bedtime fading, gradual extinction and positive reinforcement of adapted behaviors. It is very essential that the parents are accompanied throughout this therapy. Sleep hygiene and behavioral care must also take into consideration the important role of the zeitgebers of sleep-wake rhythms, i.e. the external environmental factors involved in the synchronization of the biological clocks: regular exposure to light at adapted times, regular meal and wake-up times, social activities and times for going to school. The evidence for the effectiveness of behavioral interventions in the treatment of behavioral insomnia in the typical developmental child is strong, since 94% of children show clinically significant improvements in nighttime sleepiness and waking. By contrast, only about 25% of children with ASD are improved by an approach combining sleep hygiene and behavioral therapy. Melatonin has a special and prominent place in the drug management of sleep disorders associated with ASD. Several clinical trials have shown that melatonin is effective in treating sleep disorders in patients with ASD. This work led to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granting marketing authorization in September 2018 for a sustained-release paediatric melatonin molecule (Slenyto®). This synthetic molecule is a prolonged release melatonin (PRM) which mimics the physiological pharmacokinetic and secretory characteristics of endogenous melatonin, having a very short blood half-life and prolonged secretion for several hours during the night. A recent study evaluated the efficacy and safety of pediatric PRM (mini-tablets) in 125 children, aged 2 to 17.5 years with mainly ASD. After 15 days on placebo, the children were randomized into two parallel groups, PRM or placebo in a double-blind design for 13 weeks. At endpoint, total sleep time was increased by an average of 57.5 minutes on PRM and only 9.14 minutes on placebo (P=0.034). This difference between the two groups was already significant after three weeks of treatment (P=0.006). Sleep latency was also improved in the PRM group (-39.6 minutes) compared to placebo (-12.51 minutes) (P=0.01). Consolidated sleep duration (uninterrupted by awakenings) was improved by 77.9 minutes for the PRM group and only 25.4 minutes for the placebo group (P<0.001). PRM was well tolerated, the most frequent side effects being headache and daytime drowsiness at the same level with PRM or placebo. In addition, the acceptability by the children for swallowing the mini-tablets was excellent (100% compliance). The efficacy and tolerability of PRM was maintained over the medium and long term in the open phase, over a total study duration of 2 years.","Adolescent, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Humans, Melatonin, Quality of Life, Sleep, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders, Sleep Wake Disorders","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35120753","Centre pédiatrique des pathologies du sommeil, hôpital Robert-Debré, 75015 Paris, France; Centre de référence pour la narcolepsie et les hypersomnies idiopathiques et le syndrome de Kleine-Levin (CNR Narcolepsie-Hypersomnie), Paris, France.; Prosom (association nationale de promotion des connaissances du sommeil), 7, place du Griffon, 69001 Lyon, France.; Centre ressource autisme, hôpital La Grave Place Lange, 31300 Toulouse, France.; Service de psychiatrie de l'enfant et de l'adolescent, centre d'excellence pour l'autisme et les troubles du neurodeveloppement inovand, hôpital Robert-Debré, 75019 Paris, France; Génétique humaine et fonctions cognitives, institut Pasteur, 75015 Paris, France.; Service de psychiatrie de l'enfant et de l'adolescent, centre d'excellence pour l'autisme et les troubles du neurodéveloppement STRAS&ND, hôpitaux universitaires de Strasbourg, université de Strasbourg, 67000 Strasbourg, France; CNRS UPR 3212, institut des neurosciences cellulaires et intégratives, 67000 Strasbourg, France; Centre des troubles du sommeil, centre international de recherche en chronosomnologie (CIRCSom), hôpitaux universitaires de Strasbourg, 1, place de l'Hôpital, 67000 Strasbourg, France.
