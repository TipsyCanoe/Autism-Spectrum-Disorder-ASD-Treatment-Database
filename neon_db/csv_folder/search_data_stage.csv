1,23821414,"Riluzole as an adjunctive therapy to risperidone for the treatment of irritability in children with autistic disorder: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial ",7/3/2013,"Background: A hyperglutamatergic state has been shown to play a possible role in the pathophysiology of autistic disorders. Riluzole is a glutamate-modulating agent with neuroprotective properties, which has been shown to have positive effects in many neuropsychiatric disorders. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of riluzole as an adjunctive to risperidone in the treatment of irritability in autistic children who were not optimally responding to previous medications. Study design: This was a 10-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial. Participants: The study enrolled male and female outpatients aged 5-12 years with a diagnosis of autistic disorder based on the DSM-IV-TR criteria and a score of â¥12 on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) irritability subscale who had discontinued other medications because of a lack of efficacy. Interventions: Subjects received riluzole (titrated to 50 or 100 mg/day based on bodyweight) or placebo in addition to risperidone (titrated up to 2 or 3 mg/day based on bodyweight) for 10 weeks. Outcome: Patients were assessed at baseline, week 5, and week 10. The primary outcome measure was the difference in the change in the ABC-C irritability subscale score from baseline to week 10 between the two groups. We also compared changes in other ABC-C subscale scores and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale scores between the two groups. Results: Forty-nine patients were enrolled in the study, and forty children completed the trial (dropouts: placebo = 4, riluzole = 5). A significantly greater improvement in the study primary outcome (the ABC-C irritability subscale score) was achieved by the riluzole-treated children compared with the placebo group (P = 0.03). Patients in the riluzole group also showed significantly greater improvement on the lethargy/social withdrawal (P = 0.02), stereotypic behavior (P = 0.03), and hyperactivity/non-compliance subscales (P = 0.005), but not on the inappropriate speech subscale (P = 0.20) than patients in the placebo group. Eleven patients in the riluzole group and five patients in the placebo group were classified as responders based on their CGI-I scores [Ï(2)(1) = 3.750, P = 0.05]. Children in the riluzole group experienced significantly more increases in their appetite and bodyweight than children in the placebo group by the end of the study. Conclusion: Riluzole add-on therapy shows several therapeutic outcomes, particularly for improving irritability, in children with autism. However, its add-on to risperidone also results in significantly increased appetite and weight gain.","Ali Ghaleiha, Effat Mohammadi, Mohammad-Reza Mohammadi, Mehdi Farokhnia, Amirhossein Modabbernia, Habibeh Yekehtaz, Mandana Ashrafi, Elmira Hassanzadeh, Shahin Akhondzadeh",Paediatr Drugs,"Autism Spectrum Disorder, Risperidone, AMPA Receptor, Piracetam, Riluzole",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23821414/,"Research Center for Behavioral Disorders and Substance Abuse, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran.",10.1007/s40272-013-0036-2,Yes,Yes (risperidone),Riluzole + Risperidone,"Ghaleiha, Ali",3-Jul-13,Pediatric Drugs,Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled ,10 weeks,49,33 M: 7 F,5-12 y; mean: 7.6-8.4 y,Risperidone- 2 or 3 mg/d (both based on body weight) + Riluzole- 50 or 100 mg/d; or + placebo,Irritability,ABC-C Irritability score,There was a significantly greater improvement in ABC-C irritability scores in the riluzole tx group (p=0.03). ,"Lethargy/social withdrawal, stereotypy, and hyperactivity/noncompliance",Other ABC-C subscales and CGI-I scores,"The riluzole group showed greater improvement on ABC-C lethargy/social withdrawal (p=0.02), stereotypic behavior (p=0.03), and hyperactivity/non-compliance (p=0.005) scales.

2,21309696,Safety and efficacy of donepezil in children and adolescents with autism: neuropsychological measures.,2/1/2011,"There has been recent interest in the use of cognitive enhancing drugs, such as cholinesterase inhibitors, as a possible treatment for executive functioning (EF) deficits in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The goal of this study was to assess the tolerability, safety, and efficacy of donepezil on EF in a sample of children and adolescents with ASD. Thirty-four children and adolescents with ASD (age range 8-17 years; IQ >75) were enrolled in a 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of donepezil (doses of 5 and 10 mg), followed by a 10-week open label trial for placebo nonresponders. The effect of donepezil treatment on EF was examined. Despite improvement on a number of EF measures, no statistically significant between-group differences were found (with gains observed for both the placebo and donepezil groups). The results suggest that short-term treatment with donepezil may have limited impact on cognitive functioning in ASD. Future controlled trials may need to consider a longer treatment period to detect significant gains on EF measures.","Handen Benjamin L, Johnson Cynthia R, McAuliffe-Bellin Sarah, Murray Patricia Jo,

3,32947424,"Does Pregnenolone Adjunct to Risperidone Ameliorate Irritable Behavior in Adolescents With Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial?",1/1/2020,"Pregnenolone is a neurosteroid with modulatory effects on Î³-aminobutyric acid neurotransmission. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of pregnenolone add-on to risperidone in adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Sixty-four ASD patients were randomly allocated to receive either pregnenolone (n = 32) or matching placebo (n = 32) in addition to risperidone. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Edition scale was used to evaluate the behavioral status of patients at baseline, week 5, and the trial end point. The change in score of irritability subscale was the primary outcome. Frequency of adverse effects due to trial medications was compared between the treatment groups. Fifty-nine patients completed the trial (30 in pregnenolone and 29 in the placebo arm). Baseline characteristics of both treatment groups were similar (P > 0.05). Repeated measures analysis was suggestive of greater exhibited improvement for the pregnenolone group on irritability, stereotypy, and hyperactivity subscales of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Edition over the trial period (F = 3.84, df = 1.96, P = 0.025; F = 4.29, df = 1.39, P = 0.029; F = 6.55, df = 1.67, P = 0.004, respectively). Nonetheless, the alterations in lethargy and inappropriate speech domains scores were similar for both arms (F = 0.93, df = 1.49, P = 0.375; F = 1.10, df = 1.60, P = 0.325, respectively). There was no significant difference in frequency as well as severity of adverse effects between the 2 groups. Pregnenolone adjunct to risperidone could attenuate core features associated with ASD.","Ayatollahi Arghavan, Bagheri Sayna, Ashraf-Ganjouei Amir, Moradi Kamyar, Mohammadi Mohammad-Reza, Akhondzadeh Shahin",Clinical neuropharmacology,"Adolescent, Antipsychotic Agents, Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Double-Blind Method, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Humans, Irritable Mood, Male, Neuropsychological Tests, Pregnenolone, Risperidone, Speech Disorders, Stereotyped Behavior, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32947424,"Psychiatric Research Center, Roozbeh Psychiatric Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.",10.1097/Wnf.0000000000000405,,,Pregnenolone + risperidone,"Ayatollahi, Arghavan",2020,Clinical Neuropharmacology,RCT,,64,,,,Irritability,ABC-C irritability,Greater improvement in ABC-C irritability scores in the treatment group. ,,ABC-C other subscales,Greater improvement in stereotypy and hyperactivity subscales of the ABC-C in the treatment group.

4,30744880,A randomised controlled trial of vitamin D and omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in the treatment of irritability and hyperactivity among children with autism spectrum disorder.,3/1/2019,"Irritability and hyperactivity are common in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Because pharmacological treatments may have adverse effects, and despite limited evidence, caregivers/parents often use dietary supplements such as vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids to address these behavioural symptoms. As a secondary objective of the VIDOMA (Vitamin D and Omega-3 in ASD) trial, we evaluated the efficacy of vitamin D, omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid [omega-3 LCPUFA; docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)], or both on irritability and hyperactivity. New Zealand children with ASD (aged 2.5-8 years) participated in a 12-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D (2000 IU/day, VID), omega-3 LCPUFA (722 mg/day DHA, OM), or both (2000 IU/day vitamin D + 722 mg/day DHA, VIDOM). The primary outcomes were the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist (ABC) domains of irritability and hyperactivity. Biomarkers (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and omega-3 index) and primary outcomes were measured at baseline and 12-months. Out of 111 children who completed baseline data collection, 66% completed the study (VID = 19, OM = 23, VIDOM = 15, placebo = 16). After 12 months, children receiving OM (-5.0 Â± 5.0, P = 0.001) and VID (-4.0Â±4.9, P = 0.01) had greater reduction in irritability than placebo (0.8Â±6.1). Compared to placebo, children on VID also had greater reduction in hyperactivity (-5.2Â±6.3 vs. -0.8Â±5.6, P = 0.047). Serum 25(OH)D concentration (nmol/L, meanÂ±SD) increased by 27Â±14 in VID and by 36Â±17 in VIDOM groups (P < 0.0001), and omega-3 index (%, median (25th, 75th percentiles)) by 4.4 (3.3, 5.9) in OM and by 4.0 (2.0, 6.0) in VIDOM groups (P < 0.0001), indicating a good compliance rate. The results indicate that vitamin D and omega-3 LCPUFA reduced irritability symptoms in children with ASD. Vitamin D also reduced hyperactivity symptoms in these children.","Mazahery Hajar, Conlon Cathryn A, Beck Kathryn L, Mugridge Owen, Kruger Marlena C, Stonehouse Welma, Camargo Carlos A, Meyer Barbara J, Jones Beatrix, von Hurst Pamela R",The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,"Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Double-Blind Method, Fatty Acids, Omega-3, Female, Humans, Irritable Mood, Male, New Zealand, Vitamin D, Vitamins",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30744880,"College of Health, Massey University, New Zealand.

5,,"Randomized, Controlled, Phase 2 Trial of STX209 (Arbaclofen) for Social Function in ASD",10/1/2013,"Purpose To examine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of STX209 in patients with ASD, age 5-21 years. STX209 (arbaclofen) is a selective GABA-B agonist associated with behavioral improvements and disease-modifying effects in animal models of fragile X syndrome (FXS). It is hypothesized to modulate mGluR5 receptor signaling, and to augment inhibitory neurotransmission. In a previous 8-week, open-label study of 32 subjects with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), STX209 was associated with significant improvement on the ABC-Lethargy/Social Withdrawal (ABC-LSW) subscale, the Social Responsiveness Scale, and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition (VABS) Communication score. Methods A 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in subjects who met DSM-IV criteria for Autistic Disorder, Aspergerâs Disorder, or PDD-NOS, and who had a minimum score of 8 on the ABC-LSW subscale. Up to 2 concomitant psychoactive medications were permitted, excluding antipsychotics and medications with anxiolytic effects. Subjects were randomized to either STX209 or placebo, with stratification by age and concomitant use of psychoactive medication. Study drug was titrated over 4 weeks, to a maximum of 10 mg TID (age 5-11 years) or 15 mg TID (age 12-21 years), with fixed dosing for the subsequent 8 weeks. Efficacy assessments included the ABC subscales, CGI-I, CGI-S, and VABS Social and Communication domain scores. Results 150 subjects (124 male; 130 DSM-IV Autistic Disorder; 120 ADOS-Autism) were randomized in the study, with 26 receiving at least one concomitant psychoactive medication. 130 subjects completed the study, with 10 (8 on STX209, 2 on placebo) discontinuing due to adverse events, which were generally behavioral (e.g., aggression, sleep disturbances). There were 2 serious adverse events (suicidal ideation on STX209; anaphylaxis on placebo). Suicidal ideation also occurred in 1 subject on placebo. Overall, STX209 was well-tolerated, with a 9% incidence of somnolence. On the primary endpoint, the ABC-LSW subscale, subjects on STX209 and placebo showed very similar improvements (change from baseline -5.4Â±0.8 vs. -6.0Â±0.8, meanÂ±SEM, p=0.5). On the CGI-S, subjects improved significantly more on STX209 (-0.6Â±0.1 vs. -0.2Â±0.1, p=0.006). On all other secondary endpoints, results favored STX209 numerically, but did not reach statistical significance (e.g., VABS Socialization standard score: 3.9Â±1.3 vs. 2.1Â±1.2, p=0.36). In a post-hoc analysis among subjects whose baseline and end-of-treatment Vinelands were completed by the same raters (n=93), as specified in the study protocol, those receiving STX209 showed greater improvement on the VABS Socialization scale (7.2Â±1.4 vs. 1.8Â±1.3, p=0.006). Subgroup analyses indicated that improvement on VABS Socialization scores was larger in subjects with IQâ¥70 than those with IQ<70. Conclusion STX209 was well-tolerated and shows unprecedented potential for improvements in social function. Drug effects were more evident in subjects with higher IQs. Further prospective trials of STX209 are needed.","Delahunty Carol, Walton-Bowen Karen, Kuriyama Noriko, Cherubini Maryann, Carpenter Randall, Bear Mark",American Academy of Pediatrics,"Arbaclofen, Randomized Control Trial",https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267881121_Randomized_Controlled_Phase_2_Trial_of_STX209_Arbaclofen_for_Social_Function_in_ASD,,10.2147/DHPS.S39595,Yes,No,Arbaclofen (STX209),"Delahunty, C",2013,American Academy of Pediatrics,RCT - Phase 2,12 weeks ,150,124 M: 26 F,5-21 y,"max: 10 mg 3x/d for 5-11y, 15 mg 3x/d for 12-21 y",Social behaviors. ,ABC lethargy/social withdrawal,No significant improvement with treatment. ,Autism severity and social behaviors,"CGIS severity and improvement, Socialization & Communication scales of VABS","CGIS severity improved more in the arbaclofen group.

6,,Study of the role of the transcranial magnetic stimulation on language progress in autism spectrum disorder,6/9/2021,"Background: Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are almost universally delayed in the acquisition of spoken language as primary means of communication so they tend to have restricted outcomes in terms of independence and integration. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a promising, emerging tool for the study (study and modulate excitability and plasticity, applied in single pulses to investigate corticospinal excitability, pairs of pulses to study intracortical inhibition and facilitation) and potential treatment of ASD. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of repetitive TMS in language progress in children with ASD.Results: There was a statistically significant clinical improvement in patients receiving active TMS (group I) comparing baseline Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) assessment and after treatment (P â¤ 0.05). There was mild improvement with no significant difference between the patients receiving active TMS (group I) and those of sham TMS (group II), and both groups received language therapy as regard post-treatment CARS. There was significant difference in improvement between the two groups according to eye contact (P â¤ 0.05). There was significant improvement in response to examiner (P â¤ 0.05). There was mild improvement with no statistically significant difference in attention between the two groups. There was significant difference in improvement between the two groups according to active expressive language. There was no statistically significant difference in passive vocabulary between the two groups. Conclusion: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over left inferior frontal gyrus may be a safe and effective way of improving language of ASD. The joint application of rTMS and standard language therapy may lead to more rapid improvement in the language progress of children with ASD.","Mohamed E. Darwish, Heba W. El-Beshlawy, Ehab S.

7,25580916,"N-acetylcysteine as an adjunctive therapy to risperidone for treatment of irritability in autism: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of efficacy and safety.",1/1/2015,"According to the proposed interference of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) with pathophysiologic processes of autistic disorders (ADs), we aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of NAC as an adjunct to risperidone in the treatment of ADs in a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial. The participants were referred outpatients between 4 and 12 years of age with the diagnosis of ADs and a score of more than 12 on Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) Irritability subscale score. The participants were randomized into 2 groups. One group received risperidone plus NAC, and the other group received risperidone plus placebo. The dose of risperidone was titrated between 1 and 2.0 mg/d, and the dose of NAC was 600 to 900 mg/d. The main outcome was mean decrease in the ABC-C irritability subscale score from baseline at 5 and 10 weeks. Changes in other subscales were considered as secondary outcome measures. Forty patients completed the 10-week trial. Baseline characteristics including age, sex and body weight, as well as baseline scores in 5 subscales did not demonstrate statistically significant difference between the 2 groups. Repeated-measures analysis showed significant effect for time Ã treatment interaction in irritability (P = 0.01) and hyperactivity/noncompliance (P = 0.02) subscales. By week 10, the NAC group showed significantly more reduction in irritability (P = 0.02) and hyperactivity/noncompliance (P = 0.01) subscales scores. N-acetylcysteine can be considered as an adjuvant therapy for ADs with beneficial therapeutic outcomes.","Nikoo Mohammadali, Radnia Hanieh, Farokhnia Mehdi, Mohammadi Mohammad-Reza, Akhondzadeh

8,,Donepezil hydrochloride: A double-blind study in autistic children,11/14/2003,"Recent studies in autistic brain samples have shown diminished acetylcholine and nicotinic receptor activity. We hypothesized that acetylcholinergic enhancement may pharmacologically improve some autistic characteristics. Donepezil hydrochloride, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, was studied previously in two open label studies which showed improvement in the expressive and receptive speech and aberrant behaviors of autistic children. We therefore undertook a double-blind placebo controlled study to confirm these findings. Forty-three patients (35 males, 8 females, average age 6.8 yrs., range 2.1â10.3 yrs), with diagnoses of Autistic Spectrum Disorders enrolled in a randomized six-week, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial of donepezil hydrochloride, with an additional six weeks of open-label treatment. Change was evaluated by the Childhood Autistic Rating Scale, Gardnerâs Expressive One-Word Picture Vocabulary Test, Revised, and Gardnerâs Receptive One-Word Picture Vocabulary Test. Testing was administered at baseline, six-week, and twelveweek follow-up. Expressive and receptive speech gains, as well as decreases in severity of overall autistic behavior, were documented after 6-weeks for the treatment group. These improvements were statistically significant when compared to placebo, and were clinically meaningful as assessed over time. Donepezil hydrochloride appears to improve expressive and receptive language as well as overall autistic features, consistent with the hypothesis of acetylcholinergic enhancement.","Michael G.

9,,Naltrexone in Autistic Children: Behavioral Symptoms and Attentional Learning,3/22/1993,"Objective: To assess critically the short-term efficacy and safety of naltrexone in autistic children and its effects on discrimination learning in the laboratory. Method: A parallel group design was employed. After a 2-week placebo baseline period, children were randomly assigned either to naltrexone or to placebo for a period of 3 weeks followed by a one-week posttreatment placebo period. Multiple raters and rating scales were employed in a variety of conditions. Forty-one children, all inpatients, ages 2.9 to 7.8 years, completed the study. Naltrexone reduced hyperactivity and had no effect on discrimination learning in the laboratory. There was a suggestion that it had a beneficial effect on decreasing self-injurious behavior. Untoward effects were mild and transient. Conclusion: In the present study, naltrexone significantly reduced only hyperactivity, and no serious untoward effects were observed. The effectiveness of naltrexone in the treatment of autism and self-injurious behavior requires additional assessment in a sample of children with moderate to severe self-injurious behavior.","Campbell, M., Anderson, L.

10,19487623,Lack of efficacy of citalopram in children with autism spectrum disorders and high levels of repetitive behavior: citalopram ineffective in children with autism.,6/1/2009,"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are widely prescribed for children with autism spectrum disorders. To determine the efficacy and safety of citalopram hydrobromide therapy for repetitive behavior in children with autism spectrum disorders. National Institutes of Health-sponsored randomized controlled trial. Six academic centers, including Mount Sinai School of Medicine, North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, University of California at Los Angeles, Yale University, and Dartmouth Medical School. One hundred forty-nine volunteers 5 to 17 years old (mean [SD] age, 9.4 [3.1] years) were randomized to receive citalopram (n = 73) or placebo (n = 76). Participants had autistic spectrum disorders, Asperger disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified; had illness severity ratings of at least moderate on the Clinical Global Impressions, Severity of Illness Scale; and scored at least moderate on compulsive behaviors measured with the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scales modified for pervasive developmental disorders. Twelve weeks of citalopram hydrobromide (10 mg/5 mL) or placebo. The mean (SD) maximum dosage of citalopram hydrobromide was 16.5 (6.5) mg/d by mouth (maximum, 20 mg/d). Positive response was defined by a score of much improved or very much improved on the Clinical Global Impressions, Improvement subscale. An important secondary outcome was the score on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scales modified for pervasive developmental disorders. Adverse events were systematically elicited using the Safety Monitoring Uniform Report Form. There was no significant difference in the rate of positive response on the Clinical Global Impressions, Improvement subscale between the citalopram-treated group (32.9%) and the placebo group (34.2%) (relative risk, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.61-1.51; P > .99). There was no difference in score reduction on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scales modified for pervasive developmental disorders from baseline (mean [SD], -2.0 [3.4] points for the citalopram-treated group and -1.9 [2.5] points for the placebo group; P = .81). Citalopram use was significantly more likely to be associated with adverse events, particularly increased energy level, impulsiveness, decreased concentration, hyperactivity, stereotypy, diarrhea, insomnia, and dry skin or pruritus. Results of this trial do not support the use of citalopram for the treatment of repetitive behavior in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders.

11,8911223,"A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of fluvoxamine in adults with autistic disorder.",11/1/1996,"Autistic disorder is characterized by a fundamental disturbance in social interaction, impairments in communication, and a markedly restricted repertoire of activities and interests. Abnormalities in the serotonin neurotransmitter system have been identified in some persons with autism. No consistently effective and safe drugs have been developed for treating the symptoms of autism. Thirty adults with autistic disorder completed a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the potent and selective serotonin uptake inhibitor fluvoxamine maleate. Behavioral ratings were obtained at baseline and after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. Eight (53%) of 15 patients in the fluvoxamine-treated group were categorized as responders compared with none of 15 in the placebo group (P = .001). Fluvoxamine was superior to placebo in reducing repetitive thoughts and behavior (P < .001), maladaptive behavior (P < .001), and aggression (P < .03), and in improving some aspects of social relatedness (P < .04), especially language usage (P < .008). Treatment response was not correlated with age level of autistic behavior, or full-scale IQ. Other than mild sedation and nausea in a few patients, fluvoxamine was well tolerated. No dyskinesias, adverse cardiovascular events, or seizures occurred. Fluvoxamine is more effective than placebo in the short-term treatment of the symptoms of autistic disorder in adults. Controlled studies of fluvoxamine and other potent and selective serotonin uptake inhibitors seem warranted in children and adolescents with autism.","McDougle C J, Naylor S T, Cohen D J, Volkmar F R, Heninger G R, Price L H",Archives of general psychiatry,"Adolescent, Adult, Autistic Disorder, Double-Blind Method, Female, Fluvoxamine, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Placebos, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8911223,"Clinical Neuroscience Research Unit, Abraham Ribicoff Research Facilities, Connecticut Mental Health Center, New Haven, USA.",10.1001/Archpsyc.1996.01830110037005,No,No,Fluvoxamine,"McDougle, Christopher J.

12,16275814,"Randomized, controlled, crossover trial of methylphenidate in pervasive developmental disorders with hyperactivity.",11/1/2005,"Hyperactivity and inattention are common symptoms in children with autistic disorder and related pervasive developmental disorders, but studies of stimulants in these conditions have been inconclusive. To determine the efficacy and safety of methylphenidate hydrochloride in children with pervasive developmental disorders and hyperactivity. Double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial followed by open-label continuation. Five academic outpatient clinics. Seventy-two drug-free children, aged 5 to 14 years, with pervasive developmental disorders accompanied by moderate to severe hyperactivity. Prior to randomization, subjects entered a 1-week test-dose phase in which each subject received placebo for 1 day followed by increasing doses of methylphenidate (low, medium, and high doses) that were each given for 2 days. The low, medium, and high doses of methylphenidate hydrochloride were based on weight, and they ranged from 7.5 mg/d to 50.0 mg/d in divided doses. Subjects who tolerated the test dose (n = 66) were assigned to receive placebo for 1 week and then 3 methylphenidate doses in random order during a double-blind, crossover phase. Children responding to methylphenidate then entered 8 weeks of open-label treatment at the individually determined best dose. The primary outcome measure was the teacher-rated hyperactivity subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist. Response was defined as ""much improved"" or ""very much improved"" on the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement item coupled with considerable reductions in the parent-rated and/or teacher-rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist hyperactivity subscale score. Methylphenidate was superior to placebo on the primary outcome measure, with effect sizes ranging from 0.20 to 0.54 depending on dose and rater. Thirty-five (49%) of 72 enrolled subjects were classified as methylphenidate responders. Adverse effects led to the discontinuation of study medication in 13 (18%) of 72 subjects. Methylphenidate was often efficacious in treating hyperactivity associated with pervasive developmental disorders, but the magnitude of response was less than that seen in typically developing children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

13,31725473,"Risperidone Combination Therapy With Propentofylline for Treatment of Irritability in Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial.",1/1/2019,"Propentofylline is a xanthine phosphodiesterase inhibitor and adenosine reuptake blocker with neuroprotective effects linked to anti-inflammatory and antiexcitatory properties. This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating the potential beneficial effects of propentofylline, as an adjunctive treatment with risperidone, on the severity and behavioral abnormalities of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A total of 48 children with ASD were randomly allocated into 2 groups of risperidone (initiating at 0.5 mg/d) plus propentofylline (initiating at 300 mg/d) and risperidone plus placebo. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) and Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) were used for the evaluation of ASD severity and behavioral disruptions at baseline, week 4, and week 10. Primary outcome measure of the study was ABC-C irritability subscale score, whereas CARS score along with other 4 subscales of ABC-C (lethargy/social withdrawal, stereotypic behavior, hyperactivity/noncompliance, and inappropriate speech subscales) were considered as secondary outcome measures. Results from the general linear model repeated measures analysis demonstrated significant time-treatment interaction on irritability subscale (F1.55 = 3.45; P = 0.048) and CARS (F1.41 = 4.08; P = 0.034) scores. Compared with the placebo group, children receiving propentofylline showed greater improvements in the CARS score (P = 0.037) from baseline to the study endpoint. Our results found no significant time-treatment effect on other subscales of ABC-C. Two trial groups were comparable based on the frequency of adverse effects. Our findings demonstrated that adjunctive treatment with propentofylline is effective in alleviating disease severity and improving irritability in ASD patients.

14,31638682,Effect of Fluoxetine on Obsessive-Compulsive Behaviors in Children and Adolescents With Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,10/22/2019,"Selective serotonin receptor inhibitors are prescribed to reduce the severity of core behaviors of autism spectrum disorders, but their efficacy remains uncertain. To determine the efficacy of fluoxetine for reducing the frequency and severity of obsessive-compulsive behaviors in autism spectrum disorders. Multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Participants aged 7.5-18 years with autism spectrum disorders and a total score of 6 or higher on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, modified for pervasive developmental disorder (CYBOCS-PDD) were recruited from 3 tertiary health centers across Australia. Enrollment began November 2010 and ended April 2017. Follow-up ended August 2017. Participants were randomized to receive fluoxetine (n = 75) or placebo (n = 71). Study medication was commenced at 4 or 8 mg/d for the first week, depending on weight, and then titrated to a maximum dose of 20 or 30 mg/d over 4 weeks. Treatment duration was 16 weeks. The primary outcome was the total score on the CYBOCS-PDD (scores range from 0-20; higher scores indicate higher levels of maladaptive behaviors; minimal clinically important difference, 2 points) at 16 weeks postrandomization, analyzed with a linear regression model adjusted for stratification factors (site, age at baseline, and intellectual disability), with an additional prespecified model that included additional adjustment for baseline score, sex, communication level, and imbalanced baseline and demographic variables. Among the 146 participants who were randomized (85% males; mean age, 11.2 years), 109 completed the trial; 31 in the fluoxetine group and 21 in the placebo group dropped out or did not complete treatment. The mean CYBOCS-PDD score from baseline to 16 weeks decreased in the fluoxetine group from 12.80 to 9.02 points (3.72-point decrease; 95% CI, -4.85 to -2.60) and in the placebo group from 13.13 to 10.89 points (2.53-point decrease; 95% CI, -3.86 to -1.19). The between-group mean difference at 16 weeks was -2.01 (95% CI, -3.77 to -0.25; P = .03) (adjusted for stratification factors), and in the prespecified model with further adjustment, it was -1.17 (95% CI, -3.01 to 0.67; P = .21). In this preliminary study of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders, treatment with fluoxetine compared with placebo resulted in significantly lower scores for obsessive-compulsive behaviors at 16 weeks. Interpretation is limited by the high dropout rate, null findings of prespecified analyses that accounted for potentially confounding factors and baseline imbalances, and CIs for the treatment effect that included the minimal clinically important difference. anzctr.org.au Identifier: ACTRN12608000173392.","Reddihough Dinah S, Marraffa Catherine, Mouti Anissa, O'Sullivan Molly, Lee Katherine J, Orsini Francesca, Hazell Philip, Granich Joanna, Whitehouse Andrew J O, Wray John, Dossetor David, Santosh Paramala, Silove Natalie, Kohn Michael",JAMA,"Adolescent, Anxiety, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic, Female, Fluoxetine, Humans, Male, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Patient Acuity, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, Stereotypic Movement Disorder, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638682,"Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.; Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neurosciences, Department of Child Psychiatry, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.; Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.; University of Sydney School of Medicine, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; Child Development Service, Western Australian Department of Health, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.; Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.",10.1001/Jama.2019.14685,Yes,Yes (cherry),Fluoxetine,"Reddihough, Dinah S.

15,27556593,Metformin for Treatment of Overweight Induced by Atypical Antipsychotic Medication in Young People With Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,9/1/2016,"Atypical antipsychotic medications are indicated for the treatment of irritability and agitation symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Unfortunately, these medications are associated with weight gain and metabolic complications that are especially troubling in children and with long-term use. To evaluate the efficacy of metformin for weight gain associated with atypical antipsychotic medications in children and adolescents with ASD (defined in the protocol as DSM-IV diagnosis of autistic disorder, Asperger disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified), aged 6 to 17 years. A 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial was conducted at 4 centers in Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Columbus, Ohio; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Nashville, Tennessee. In all, 209 potential participants were screened by telephone, 69 individuals provided consent, and 61 participants were randomized to receive metformin or placebo between April 26, 2013, and June 24, 2015. Metformin or matching placebo titrated up to 500 mg twice daily for children aged 6 to 9 years and 850 mg twice daily for those 10 to 17 years. The primary outcome measure was change in body mass index (BMI) z score during 16 weeks of treatment. Secondary outcomes included changes in additional body composition and metabolic variables. Safety, tolerability, and efficacy analyses all used a modified intent-to-treat sample comprising all participants who received at least 1 dose of medication. Of the 61 randomized participants, 60 participants initiated treatment (45 [75%] male; mean [SD] age, 12.8 [2.7] years). Metformin reduced BMI z scores from baseline to week 16 significantly more than placebo (difference in 16-week change scores vs placebo, -0.10 [95% CI, -0.16 to -0.04]; P = .003). Statistically significant improvements were also noted in secondary body composition measures (raw BMI, -0.95 [95% CI, -1.46 to -0.45] and raw weight, -2.73 [95% CI, -4.04 to -1.43]) but not in metabolic variables. Overall, metformin was well tolerated. Five participants in the metformin group discontinued treatment owing to adverse events (agitation, 4; sedation, 1). Participants receiving metformin vs placebo experienced gastrointestinal adverse events during a significantly higher percentage of treatment days (25.1% vs 6.8%; P = .005). Metformin may be effective in decreasing weight gain associated with atypical antipsychotic use and is well tolerated by children and adolescents with ASD. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01825798.","Anagnostou Evdokia, Aman Michael G, Handen Benjamin L, Sanders Kevin B, Shui Amy, Hollway Jill A, Brian Jessica, Arnold L Eugene, Capano Lucia, Hellings Jessica A, Butter Eric, Mankad Deepali, Tumuluru Rameshwari, Kettel Jessica, Newsom Cassandra R, Hadjiyannakis Stasia, Peleg Naomi, Odrobina Dina, McAuliffe-Bellin Sarah, Zakroysky Pearl, Marler Sarah, Wagner Alexis, Wong Taylor, Macklin Eric A, Veenstra-VanderWeele Jeremy",JAMA psychiatry,"Adolescent, Antipsychotic Agents, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Body Mass Index, Child, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Intention to Treat Analysis, Male, Metformin, Overweight, Weight Gain",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27556593,"Nisonger Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus.; Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee.; Bloorview Research Institute, Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Pediatrics, CHEO Research Institute, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.; Biostatistics Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston11Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Biostatistics Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.; Department of Psychiatry and Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology, Columbia University, New York, New York13New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York14Center for Autism and the Developing Brain, New York Presbyterian Hospital, White Plains, New York.; Department of Psychology, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio8Department of Pediatrics and Psychology, The Ohio State University, Columbus.; Bloorview Research Institute, Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada2Department of Pediatrics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Psychiatry, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee.",10.1001/Jamapsychiatry.2016.1232,Yes,,Metformin hydrochloride (Riomet),"Anagnastou, E",Aug-16,JAMA Psychiatry,Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled  ,16 weeks,60,45 M: 15 F,6-17 y; M= 12.8 y (SD: 2.7),500 mg BID for 6-9 y (M: 1000 mg/d); 800 mg BID for 10-17 y (M:1587 mg/d),Treatment of weight gain from atypical antipsychotic use,BMI z score,Metformin was superior to placebo in reducing weight gain. 11% of metformin treatment participants had 8-9% declines in BMI. ,Changes in body composition and metabolic variables,"Body variables: absolute and relative change in weight, absolute BMI, abdominal and hip circumference; fasting metabolic variables ",No significant changes in metabolic variables for metformin or placebo groups. ,"Abnormal feces, increase in GI AEs.

16,35793101,Balovaptan vs Placebo for Social Communication in Childhood Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,8/1/2022,"There are no approved medications for the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), socialization and communication difficulties. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of balovaptan, an oral selective vasopressin 1a receptor antagonist, compared with placebo in children and adolescents with ASD. The aV1ation study was a randomized, double-blind, 24-week, parallel-group, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial. Between November 22, 2016, and September 3, 2019, individuals were screened and randomly assigned to treatment groups. The primary efficacy analysis population comprised participants taking age-adjusted balovaptan equivalent to a 10-mg adult dose and participants from the concurrently randomized placebo group. This multicenter trial took place across 41 sites in the US. Participants were aged 5 to 17 years with diagnosed ASD and an IQ of 70 or greater. Data were analyzed from April 8 to November 16, 2020. Participants were randomly assigned to daily 4-mg or 10-mg adult-equivalent balovaptan or placebo, until the 4-mg group was discontinued. The primary end point was change from baseline on the Vineland-II two-domain composite (2DC; socialization and communication domains) score at week 24. Between November 2016 and September 2019, a total of 599 individuals were screened and 339 participants were randomly assigned to receive 4-mg balovaptan adult-equivalent dose (91 [26.8%]), 10-mg balovaptan adult-equivalent dose (126 [37.2%]), or placebo (122 [36.0%]). Primary analysis included 86 participants assigned to receive 10-mg balovaptan adult-equivalent dose and 81 assigned to receive placebo (mean [SD] age, 12.1 [3.4] years; 139 male participants [83.2%]). No statistically significant differences were observed between the balovaptan and placebo groups in change from baseline on the Vineland-II 2DC score at week 24 (difference in adjusted least-squares mean, -0.16; 90% CI, -2.56 to 2.23; P = .91). No improvements for balovaptan vs placebo were observed at week 24 for any secondary end points. Balovaptan was well tolerated with no emerging safety concerns. Similar proportions of participants reported adverse events (balovaptan, 66 of 86 [76.7%] vs placebo, 61 of 81 [75.3%]) and serious adverse events (balovaptan, 1 of 86 [1.2%] vs placebo, 4 of 81 [4.9%]). In this randomized clinical trial, balovaptan did not demonstrate efficacy in improvement of socialization and communication in this population with pediatric ASD. Balovaptan was well tolerated in children 5 years or older. Further development of robust, sensitive, and objective outcome measures may help to improve future studies in the assessment of therapies targeting communication and socialization in pediatric ASD.

17,31063671,Pharmacotherapy of Autism Spectrum Disorder: Results from the Randomized BAART Clinical Trial.,6/1/2019,"The objective of this trial, Biomarkers in Autism of Aripiprazole and Risperidone Treatment (BAART), was to provide support and guidance for an evidence-based approach for the selection and monitoring of initial pharmacotherapy in patients with autism by assessing predictors of efficacy, tolerability, and safety. This randomized double-blind parallel-group study was conducted in three academic medical centers and a single private pediatric practice. Eighty children or adolescents (aged 6-17 yrs) with autistic disorder were enrolled, and 61 patients were randomized to the study drug. Of those patients, 51 completed the 10-week trial, and 31 completed an optional 12-week blinded extension phase. All patients were treated with 2 weeks of placebo before random assignment to receive aripiprazole (31 patients) or risperidone (30 patients) for 10 weeks. Sixteen placebo responders (20%) were excluded from further analysis. Drug dosing followed U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling, and weekly dosage adjustments were allowed until week 4; patients were then maintained on a fixed dose for 6 additional weeks. Safety, physical, and psychological assessments were recorded weekly or every 2 weeks. No significant differences in severity of illness between the aripiprazole and risperidone groups were noted at baseline. All patients significantly improved on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability subscale after 1 week and continued for the remaining 9 weeks and the extension phase. Improvement was greatest in the risperidone group at every assessment period and was statistically significantly better than that in the aripiprazole group at weeks 3 and 6 (p<0.05). No dose-limiting adverse events occurred during the dose-titration period. Mean weight gain in the aripiprazole group was significantly less than that in the risperidone group at week 4 (0.62 vs 1.38 kg, p=0.033) and week 10 (1.61 vs 3.31 kg, p<0.001), but the difference became nonsignificant for the 31 patients completing the 3-month extension phase (4.36 vs 5.55 kg, p=0.26). Pharmacotherapy of patients with autism spectrum disorder resulted in behavioral improvement within 1 week and lasted at least 22 weeks. Weight gain occurred to a greater degree with risperidone than aripiprazole initially, but the differences became nonsignificant by the end of the trial. Our trial supports previous results of drug efficacy and safety in patients with autism spectrum disorder from other trials and extends the evidence-based support for choosing an FDA-approved drug for initial pharmacotherapy for autism spectrum disorder.","DeVane C Lindsay, Charles Jane M, Abramson Ruth K, Williams John E, Carpenter Laura A, Raven Sarah, Gwynette Frampton, Stuck Craig A, Geesey Mark E, Bradley Catherine, Donovan Jennifer L, Hall Alicia G, Sherk Shelley T, Powers Nancy R, Spratt Eve, Kinsman Anne, Kruesi Markus J, Bragg John E",Pharmacotherapy,"Adolescent, Antipsychotic Agents, Aripiprazole, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Risperidone, Treatment Outcome, Weight Gain",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063671,"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina.; Department of Developmental-Behavioral Pediatrics, Greenville Hospital System University Medical System, Greenville, South Carolina.; Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina.; Department of Neuropsychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina.",10.1002/Phar.2271,Yes,Yes,Aripiprazole and risperidone,"DeVane, C.",Jun-19,Pharmacotherapy,randomized double-blind parallel-group,10 weeks (with optional 12-week extension phase),61,48 M: 13 F,6-17 y (m: 8.3-8.5),aripiprazole: 2-15 mg/d; risperidone: 0.5-3.0 mg/d,severity. irritability,ABC irritability; CGI,"psychiatric measures: All patients significantly improved on the ABC-irritability.

18,7174605,The effects of haloperidol on learning and behavior in autistic children.,6/1/1982,"The effects of haloperidol on behavioral symptoms and learning were critically assessed in autistic children in an ongoing double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial. Children were randomly assigned to haloperidol-placebo-haloperidol or placebo-haloperidol-placebo treatment sequences. Statistically, haloperidol was significantly superior to placebo in reducing behavioral symptoms. In discrimination learning paradigm, children receiving haloperidol learned the discrimination while those on placebo did not. Discrimination attained on haloperidol was retained when the children were switched to placebo.","Campbell M, Anderson L T, Small A M, Perry R, Green W H, Caplan R",Journal of autism and developmental

19,7559293,Use of methylphenidate in the treatment of children with autistic disorder.,6/1/1995,"The use of psychostimulants in autistic disorder has not received extensive evaluation. Furthermore, their use for the symptomatic control of autistic disorder has been felt to be contraindicated. This study investigates the use of methylphenidate (MPH) for the treatment of selected symptoms of autistic disorder. Ten children, ages 7-11, with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of autistic disorder participated in a double-blind crossover study using placebo and two MPH doses (10 mg or 20 mg bid). Subjects showed modest but statistically significant improvement on MPH over placebo. No significant side effects including worsening stereotypic movements occurred on either dose. Improvement in hyperactivity and lack of adverse effects suggest that MPH may be useful in the treatment of hyperactive autistic children.","Quintana H, Birmaher B, Stedge D, Lennon S, Freed J, Bridge

20,2663834,The effects of haloperidol on discrimination learning and behavioral symptoms in autistic children.,6/1/1989,"This double-blind and placebo-controlled clinical trial in autistic children had three objectives: (a) to replicate earlier findings that haloperidol administration is associated with a significant reduction of behavioral symptoms; (b) to further assess its safety when given on a short-term basis; and (c) to assess whether it has an effect on discrimination learning. Forty-five children, 2.02 to 7.58 years old (M = 4.49), completed this crossover design, with random assignment to treatment sequences. Haloperidol was shown to be a powerful therapeutic agent when administered for 4 weeks and free of side effects; at doses ranging from 0.25 to 4.0 mg/day (M = 0.844), there was a clinically and statistically significant reduction of a variety of symptoms.

21,2745390,Urinary dopamine metabolites as indicators of the responsiveness to fenfluramine treatment in children with autistic behavior.,6/1/1989,"Modifications in serotonin and dopamine metabolism were evaluated in 13 children with autistic behavior and related to their responsiveness to fenfluramine treatment. A double-blind medication-placebo crossover design was used. Each patient received 1.5 mg/kg fenfluramine daily for 3 months followed and preceded by placebo for 1 month. Clinical improvement was observed in 6 children (responders). It included reduction of behavioral symptoms such as motor activity, anxiety, mood disturbances, and distractibility. Modifications of serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and DA metabolites [homovanillic acid (HVA) and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC)] were assessed at urinary levels. Responders and nonresponders showed a significant decrease of urinary 5-HT levels on fenfluramine. The main differences between the two groups of subjects were found with HVA, the major metabolite of DA. Fenfluramine significantly increased HVA levels in responders whereas no significant modification was found in nonresponders. Moreover the initial level of HVA (lower in responders) significantly differentiated the two groups. These results suggest that the clinical response to fenfluramine could be related to the dopaminergic action of this drug and that urinary DA metabolite levels could be considered as indicators of the responsiveness to fenfluramine treatment in children with autistic behavior.","Barthelemy C, Bruneau N, Jouve J, Martineau J, Muh J P, Lelord G",Journal of autism and developmental disorders,"3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic Acid, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Dopamine, Double-Blind Method, Female, Fenfluramine, Homovanillic Acid, Humans, Male, Serotonin",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2745390,"Explorations Fonctionnelles Psychopathologiques, C.H.U.

This study aims to assess the efficacy of a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of autism In a 10-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study, 40 outpatient children with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, text revision clinical diagnosis of autism were randomly allocated to celecoxib plus risperidone or placebo plus risperidone. The dose of risperidone and celecoxib were titrated up to 3 and 300 mg/day, respectively. Patients were assessed at baseline and after 2, 4, 6, and 10 weeks of starting medication using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) Rating Scale. Primary outcome measure was the change in irritability subscale of ABC-C. Significant time Ã treatment interaction was observed for Irritability (F (1.658, 63.021) = 13.580, P < 0.001), Lethargy/Social Withdrawal (F (1.948, 74.032) = 16.811, P < 0.001), and Stereotypic Behavior (F(1.742, 66.198) = 12.104, P < 0.001), but not for Hyperactivity/Noncompliance (F (2.564, 97.424) = 1.469, P = 0.232), and Inappropriate Speech subscales (F (1.607, 61.075) = 0.173, P = 0.794). By week 10, patients in the celecoxib group showed significantly greater improvement in the Irritability (P < 0.001), Lethargy/Social Withdrawal (P < 0.001), and Stereotypic Behavior (P < 0.00) but not in Hyperactivity/Noncompliance (P = 0.202) and Inappropriate Speech (P = 0.802) subscales than the placebo group. Complete response was achieved by four (20 %) patients in the placebo group and 11 (55 %) patients in the celecoxib group (Ï (2) (1) = 5.227, P = 0.022). Frequency of side effects was similar between the two groups. Combination of risperidone and celecoxib was superior to risperidone alone in treating irritability, social withdrawal, and stereotypy of children with autism.

23,18080171,"Risperidone versus haloperidol in children and adolescents with AD : a randomized, controlled, double-blind trial.",2/1/2008,"The aim of the study was to compare safety, efficacy and tolerability of risperidone with haloperidol in the treatment of Autistic Disorder (AD). This study was designed as a double-blind, prospective, for a 12-week period. A total of 30 subjects, between the ages of 8 and 18 with AD based on DSM IV criteria, were included in the study. Behavioral Rating Scales were performed by the investigators and the parents. Safety assessment included vital signs, electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram, adverse events, laboratory tests, extrapyramidal symptoms and the side effects. Both treatments were applied in a once daily dosage regimen of 0.01-0.08 mg/kg/day. The reduction from baseline in Ritvo-Freeman Real Life Rating Scale (RF-RLRS), sensory motor (subscale I) and language (subscale V) scores were significant in risperidone group (P < 0.05). Compared to haloperidol, risperidone led to a significantly greater reduction in the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and Turgay DSM-IV Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) scale scores (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). There was a greater increase of prolactin in the risperidone group, while alanine amino transferase (ALT) had further increased in the haloperidol group. Sensory motor behaviors (subscale I) and language at the end of the 12th week, RF-RLRS sensory motor and language subscale scores decreased in the risperidone group further than the other group (P < 0.05). Risperidone was found to be more effective than haloperidol in the treatment of behavioral symptoms, impulsivity, language skills, and impaired social relations in children with AD. These results demonstrated that both drugs were safe and well tolerated in the treatment of AD.","Miral Suha, Gencer Ozlem, Inal-Emiroglu F Neslihan, Baykara Burak, Baykara Aysen, Dirik Eray",European child & adolescent psychiatry,"Adolescent, Alanine Transaminase, Antipsychotic Agents, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child Behavior Disorders, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Double-Blind Method, Dyskinesia, Drug-Induced, Female, Humans, Male, Outcome Assessment, Health Care, Personality Assessment, Prolactin, Risperidone",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18080171,"Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Dokuz Eylul University Faculty of Medicine, 35340 Narlidere, Izmir, Turkey. suha.miral@deu.edu.tr",10.1007/S00787-007-0620-5,Yes (risperidone) No (Haloperidol),Yes (risperidone) No (Haloperidol),Risperidone v.

24,30980177,"Baclofen as an adjuvant therapy for autism: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial ",4/12/2019,"Increasing evidence suggests that the function of the GABAergic system is abnormally low in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Baclofen, which functions as a selective agonist for GABAB receptors, does appear promising for the treatment of ASD. We conducted a 10-week randomized-controlled study aimed at evaluating the potential of baclofen as an adjuvant therapy to enhance the effect of risperidone in children with ASD. Sixty-four children (3-12 years) with moderate-to-severe irritability symptoms of ASD were included. We used the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Edition (ABC-C) for the outcome measures on each of the follow-up visits (weeks 0, 5, and 10). Analysis of the combined data revealed significant improvement for all the ABC subscales (irritability: F = 51.644, df = 1.66, p < 0.001, lethargy: F = 39.734, df = 1.38, p < 0.001, stereotypic behavior: F = 25.495, df = 1.56, p < 0.001, hyperactivity: F = 54.135, df = 1.35, p < 0.001, and inappropriate speech: F = 19.277, df = 1.47, p = 0.004). Combined treatment with baclofen and risperidone exerted a greater effect on improvement of hyperactivity symptoms at both midpoint [Cohen's d, 95% confidence interval (CI) = - 3.14, - 5.56 to - 0.72] and endpoint (d, 95% CI = - 4.45, - 8.74 to - 0.16) when compared with treatment with placebo plus risperidone. The two treatments achieved comparable results for other outcome measures. Our data support safety and efficacy of baclofen as an adjuvant to risperidone for improvement of hyperactivity symptoms in children with ASD.","Seyedeh-Mahsa Mahdavinasab, Amene Saghazadeh, Nogol Motamed-Gorji, Salar Vaseghi, Mohammad-Reza Mohammadi, Rosa Alichani, Shahin Akhondzadeh",European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry,Autism; Baclofen; GABA; GABAergic inhibition; Hyperactivity; Randomized-controlled trial.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30980177/,"Psychiatric Research Center, Roozbeh Psychiatric Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, South Kargar Street, Tehran, 13337, Iran; Department of Psychiatry, Razi Hospital, University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Sciences, Tehran, Iran; Psychiatric Research Center, Roozbeh Psychiatric Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, South Kargar Street, Tehran, 13337, Iran.",10.1007/s00787-019-01333-5,Yes,No (baclofen) yes (risperidone),Baclofen +  Risperidone,"Mahdavinsasab, Seyedeh-Mahsa",12-Apr-19,European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry,Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled  ,10 weeks,64,46 M: 18 F,3-12 y; Mean: 8 y,Baclofen: 0.6 mg Kg^-1 3x/day; Max dose of Risperidone was 1 mg/d for pts under 20kg and 2 mg/d for pts 20 kgo,Irritability,ABC-irritability,"Baclofen adjuvant risperidone treatment showed significant improvement in ABC-irritability scores, as well as all other subscales.

25,30980177,"Baclofen as an adjuvant therapy for autism: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.",12/1/2019,"Increasing evidence suggests that the function of the GABAergic system is abnormally low in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Baclofen, which functions as a selective agonist for GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, does appear promising for the treatment of ASD. We conducted a 10-week randomized-controlled study aimed at evaluating the potential of baclofen as an adjuvant therapy to enhance the effect of risperidone in children with ASD. Sixty-four children (3-12 years) with moderate-to-severe irritability symptoms of ASD were included. We used the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Edition (ABC-C) for the outcome measures on each of the follow-up visits (weeks 0, 5, and 10). Analysis of the combined data revealed significant improvement for all the ABC subscales (irritability: F = 51.644, df = 1.66, p < 0.001, lethargy: F = 39.734, df = 1.38, p < 0.001, stereotypic behavior: F = 25.495, df = 1.56, p < 0.001, hyperactivity: F = 54.135, df = 1.35, p < 0.001, and inappropriate speech: F = 19.277, df = 1.47, p = 0.004). Combined treatment with baclofen and risperidone exerted a greater effect on improvement of hyperactivity symptoms at both midpoint [Cohen's d, 95% confidence interval (CI) = - 3.14, - 5.56 to - 0.72] and endpoint (d, 95% CI = - 4.45, - 8.74 to - 0.16) when compared with treatment with placebo plus risperidone. The two treatments achieved comparable results for other outcome measures. Our data support safety and efficacy of baclofen as an adjuvant to risperidone for improvement of hyperactivity symptoms in children with ASD.","Mahdavinasab Seyedeh-Mahsa, Saghazadeh Amene, Motamed-Gorji Nogol, Vaseghi Salar, Mohammadi Mohammad-Reza, Alichani Rosa, Akhondzadeh Shahin",European child & adolescent psychiatry,"Antipsychotic Agents, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Baclofen, Child, Child, Preschool, Double-Blind Method, Female, GABA-B Receptor Agonists, Humans, Male, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980177,"Psychiatric Research Center, Roozbeh Psychiatric Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, South Kargar Street, Tehran, 13337, Iran.; Department of Psychiatry, Razi Hospital, University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Psychiatric Research Center, Roozbeh Psychiatric Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, South Kargar Street, Tehran, 13337, Iran. s.akhond@neda.net.",10.1007/S00787-019-01333-5,Yes,No (baclofen) yes (risperidone),Baclofen +  Risperidone,"Mahdavinsasab, Seyedeh-Mahsa",Apr-19,European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry,Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled  ,10 weeks,64,46 M: 18 F,3-12 y; Mean: 8 y,Baclofen: 0.6mg Kg^-1 3x/day; Max dose of Risperidone was 1mg/day for pts under 20kg and 2mg/day for pts 20kg and over,Irritability,ABC-irritability,"Baclofen adjuvant risperidone treatment showed significant improvement in ABC-irritability scores, ","Lethargy/social withdrawal, stereotypy, and hyperactivity/noncompliance",ABC-C: all other subscales. ,Baclofen and risperidone treatment showed improvement on all subscales of the ABC (highest on hyperactivity),Increased appetite,No serious AEs,n=6 ,Not reported. ,"""TheA35:V35 present randomized-controlled trial provided the first clinical evidence of safety and efficacy of baclofen as an adjuvant to risperidone to improve hyperactivity symptoms in children with ASD.""

26,17929164,A double-blind placebo controlled trial of piracetam added to risperidone in patients with autistic disorder.,9/1/2008,"It has been reported that autism is a hypoglutamatergic disorder. Therefore, it was of interest to assess the efficacy of piracetam, a positive modulator of AMPA-sensitive glutamate receptors in autistic disorder. About 40 children between the ages three and 11 years (inclusive) with a DSM IV clinical diagnosis of autism and who were outpatients from a specialty clinic for children were recruited. The children presented with a chief complaint of severely disruptive symptoms related to autistic disorder. Patients were randomly allocated to piracetam + risperidone (Group A) or placebo + risperidone (Group B) for a 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The dose of risperidone was titrated up to 2 mg/day for children between 10 and 40 kg and 3 mg/day for children weighting above 40 kg. The dose of piracetam was titrated up to 800 mg/day. Patients were assessed at baseline and after 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks of starting medication. The measure of the outcome was the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) Rating Scale (total score). The ABC-C Rating Scale scores improved with piracetam. The difference between the two protocols was significant as indicated by the effect of group, the between subjects factor (F = 5.85, d.f. = 1, P = 0.02). The changes at the endpoint compared with baseline were: -11.90 +/- 3.79 (mean +/- SD) and -5.15 +/- 3.04 for group A and B respectively. A significant difference was observed on the change in scores in the ABC-C Rating Scale in week 10 compared with baseline in the two groups (t = 6.017, d.f. = 38, P < 0.0001). The results suggest that a combination of atypical antipsychotic medications and a glutamate agent such as piracetam, might have increase synergistic effects in the treatment of autism.","Akhondzadeh Shahin, Tajdar Hamid, Mohammadi Mohammad-Reza, Mohammadi Mohammad, Nouroozinejad Gholam-Hossein, Shabstari Omid L, Ghelichnia Hossein-Ali",Child psychiatry and human development,"Antipsychotic Agents, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Double-Blind Method, Drug Administration Schedule, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Humans, Male, Neuroprotective Agents, Piracetam, Psychomotor Agitation, Receptors, AMPA, Risperidone, Surveys and Questionnaires",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17929164,"Psychiatric Research Center, Roozbeh Psychiatric Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, South Kargar Street, Tehran, 13337, Iran. s.akhond@neda.net",10.1007/S10578-007-0084-3,yes both,yes (risperidone),Piracetam + Risperidone,"Akhondzadeh, Shahin",11-Oct-07,Child Psychiatry and Human Development,Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled  ,10 weeks ,40,30 M: 10 F,3-11 y; Mean: 6.8 y,Risperidone: 2 mg/d for children 10-40 kg; 3 mg/d for children 40 kgo; Piracetam: up to 800 mg/d,Core symptoms of ASD,ABC-C Rating Scale (total score) ,Scores improved with piracetam ,,,,"There were no differences in side effects or the frequency between treatment groups.

27,22392415,A double-blind placebo controlled trial of Ginkgo biloba added to risperidone in patients with autistic disorders.,10/1/2012,"Ginkgo biloba has been reported to affect the neurotransmitter system and to have antioxidant properties that could impact the pathogenesis of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Based on these studies, we decided to assess the effectiveness of Ginkgo biloba extract (Ginko T.D., Tolidaru, Iran) as an adjunctive agent to risperidone in the treatment of autism. Forty-seven outpatients with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of autism ages between 4 and 12 years were assigned to this double blinded clinical trial and were randomly divided into two groups. One group received risperidone plus Ginko T.D and the other received risperidone plus placebo. The dose of risperidone was 1-3 mg/day and the dose of Ginko T.D. was 80 mg/day for patients under 30 kg and 120 mg/day for patients above 30 kg. Patients were assessed using Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) rating scale and the side effect check list every 2 weeks until the endpoint. None of the 5 subscales of ABC-C rating scale showed significant differences between the two groups. Incidents of side effects were not significantly different between the two groups. Adding Ginkgo biloba to risperidone did not affect the treatment outcome of ADs. Nevertheless, further observations are needed to confirm this result.","Hasanzadeh Elmira, Mohammadi Mohammad-Reza, Ghanizadeh Ahmad, Rezazadeh Shams-Ali, Tabrizi Mina, Rezaei Farzin, Akhondzadeh Shahin",Child psychiatry and human development,"Administration, Oral, Antipsychotic Agents, Child, Child Behavior, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Child, Preschool, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Double-Blind Method, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Ginkgo biloba, Humans, Iran, Male, Phytotherapy, Plant Extracts, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Risperidone, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22392415,"Psychiatric Research Center, Roozbeh Psychiatric Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, South Kargar Street, 13337 Tehran, Iran.",10.1007/S10578-012-0292-3,,,Ginko biloba + Risperidone,"Hasanzadeh, Elmira",6-Mar-12,Child Psychiatry & Human Development,Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled  - Pilot,10 weeks,47,39 M: 8 F,4-12 y; mean: 6.4 y (SD: 2.2),"Risperidone: 1-3 mg/d + Gingko: 80 mg/d (pts under 30 kg), 120 mg/d (pts 30 kg); or + placebo",Core symptoms of ASD.,ABC-C ,No subscales showed differences between treatment groups.

This is the first prospective randomized clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of these two medications in patients with autism spectrum disorders. Fifty nine children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders were randomized to receive either aripiprazole or risperidone for 2 months. The primary outcome measure was change in Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) scores. Adverse events were assessed. Aripiprazole as well as risperidone lowered ABC scores during 2 months. The rates of adverse effects were not significantly different between the two groups. The safety and efficacy of aripiprazole (mean dose 5.5 mg/day) and risperidone (mean dose 1.12 mg/day) were comparable. The choice between these two medications should be on the basis of clinical equipoise considering the patient's preference and clinical profile.","Ghanizadeh Ahmad, Sahraeizadeh Aliakbar, Berk Michael",Child psychiatry and human development,"Adolescent, Antipsychotic Agents, Aripiprazole, Autistic Disorder, Body Weight, Child, Child, Preschool, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Irritable Mood, Male, Piperazines, Quinolones, Risperidone, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23801256,"School of Medicine, Research Center for Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, Shiraz, Iran, ghanizadeha@hotmail.com.",10.1007/S10578-013-0390-X,Yes,Yes,Aripiprazole and Risperidone,"Ghanizadeh, Ahmed",26-Jun-13,Child Psychiatry and Human Development,Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled ; head to head comparison,2 months,59,48 M: 11 F,"4-18, Mean: 9.5 years",Aripiprazole mean: 5.5 mg/d; Risperidone mean: 1.12 mg/d.

Patients received flexibly dosed aripiprazole (1-15 mg/day) or placebo. Ninety-two patients were randomized to placebo (n = 45) or aripiprazole (n = 47). Aripiprazole produced a significant improvement in the mean parent/caregiver-rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist Japanese Version irritability subscale score relative to placebo from week 3 through week 8. Administration of aripiprazole provided significantly greater improvement in the mean clinician-rated Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scores than placebo from week 2 through week 8. All patients randomized to aripiprazole completed the study, and no serious adverse events were reported. Three patients in placebo group discontinued. Aripiprazole was effective and generally safe and well-tolerated in the treatment of irritability associated with ASD in Japanese children and adolescents.","Ichikawa Hironobu, Mikami Katsunaka, Okada Takashi, Yamashita Yushiro, Ishizaki Yuko, Tomoda Akemi, Ono Hiroaki, Usuki Chiharu, Tadori Yoshihiro",Child psychiatry and human development,"Adolescent, Antipsychotic Agents, Aripiprazole, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Irritable Mood, Japan, Male, Parents, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28004215,"Department of Pediatrics, Kansai Medical University Medical Center, Moriguchi, Osaka, Japan.; Department of Psychiatry, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan.; Department of Medical Affairs, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan.

30,33029705,Folinic Acid as Adjunctive Therapy in Treatment of Inappropriate Speech in Children with Autism: A Double-Blind and Placebo-Controlled Randomized Trial.,10/1/2021,"This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of folinic acid/placebo as an adjuvant to risperidone on inappropriate speech and other behavioral symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Fifty-five ASD children (age (mean Â± standard deviation) = 13.40 Â± 2.00; male/female: 35/20) were evaluated for behavioral symptoms at baseline, week 5, and week 10 using the aberrant behavior checklist-community (ABC-C). Folinic acid dosage was 2 mg/kg up to 50 mg per day for the entire course of the study. The repeated measures analysis showed significant effect for time Ã treatment interaction on inappropriate speech (F = 3.51; df = 1.61; P = 0.044), stereotypic behavior (F = 4.02; df = 1.37; P = 0.036), and hyperactivity/noncompliance (F = 6.79; df = 1.66; P = 0.003) subscale scores. In contrast, no significant effect for time Ã treatment interaction was found on lethargy/social withdrawal (F = 1.06; df = 1.57; P = 0.336) and irritability (F = 2.86; df = 1.91; P = 0.064) subscale scores. Our study provided preliminary evidence suggesting that folinic acid could be recommended as a beneficial complementary supplement for alleviating speech and behavioral symptoms in children with ASD.Clinical trial registeration: This trial was registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials ( www.irct.ir ; No. IRCT20090117001556N114).","Batebi Neda, Moghaddam Hossein Sanjari, Hasanzadeh Alireza, Fakour Yousef, Mohammadi Mohammad Reza, Akhondzadeh Shahin",Child psychiatry and human development,"Antipsychotic Agents, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Child, Double-Blind Method, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Humans, Iran, Leucovorin, Male, Speech, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33029705,"Psychiatric Research Center, Roozbeh Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. s.akhond@neda.net.; Psychiatric Research Center, Roozbeh Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.",10.1007/S10578-020-01072-8,Yes (risperidone),Yes (risperidone),Folinic acid + Risperidone,"Batebi, Neda",7-Oct-20,Child Psychiatry and Human Development,Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled ,10 weeks,55,35 M: 20 F,Mean: 13.4 y (SD: 2),"Risperidone- 1-2 mg/d (Flexible based on weight).

31,16119478,Clinical efficacy of fluvoxamine and functional polymorphism in a serotonin transporter gene on childhood autism.,6/1/2005,"We studied the correlation between response to fluvoxamine and serotonin transporter gene promoter region polymorphism (5-HTTLPR). Eighteen children with autistic disorder completed a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover study of fluvoxamine. Behavioral assessments were obtained before and at 12 weeks of treatment. 5-HTTLPR (long (l) or short(s)), was analyzed by the PCR method. Ten out of 18 patients responded to fluvoxamine treatment; allele type analysis revealed that clinical global effectiveness was noted significantly more in the l allele than in the s allele. However, with respect to language use, a significant effectiveness was noted in the s allele. 5-HTTLPR may influence the individual responses to fluvoxamine administration.","Sugie Yoko, Sugie Hideo, Fukuda Tokiko, Ito Masataka, Sasada Yumiko, Nakabayashi Mutsumi, Fukashiro Kazunobu, Ohzeki Takehiko",Journal of autism and developmental disorders,"Alleles, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Fluvoxamine, Gene Expression, Genotype, Humans, Polymorphism, Genetic, Promoter Regions, Genetic, Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16119478,"Department of Pediatrics, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan. y-sugie@umin.ac.jp",10.1007/S10803-005-3305-2,No,No,Fluvoxamine,"Sugie, Yoko",Jun-05,Journal of Autism & Developmental Disorders,double-blind Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled  - crossover,12 weeks ,18,15 M: 4 F,3-8.4 y (m: 5.3 y),"1 mg/kg/d for 2 weeks, 2 mg/kg/d for 3 weeks, 3 mg/kg/d for 6 weeks, 1.5 mg/kg/d for 2 weeks",Molecular genetic analysis,efficacy of fluvoxamine and serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) polymorphism,5-HTTLPR long (l) or short (s) alleles might influence fluvoxamine behavior response. ,Core features of autism and adverse effects,Behavior Assessment Scale (BAS); CGI for different genotypes; adverse effects measured by blood biochemistry,"For the BAS, 10 out of 18 patients ""responded"" to fluvoxamine treatment.

Randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial using crossover design over 6 months for 43 children, aged 3-8 years. Outcome measurement tools included monthly Global Behaviour Rating Scales, Additional Rating Scales of other symptoms by parents and therapists, and monthly completion of the Rescorla Language Development Survey. Compared with placebo, treatment with enzyme was not associated with clinically significant improvement in behaviour, food variety, gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep quality, engagement with therapist, or the Language Development Survey Vocabulary or Sentence Complexity Scores. A small statistically significant improvement on enzyme therapy was seen for the food variety scores. No clinically significant effect improvement of autism symptoms with enzyme use was shown with this trial, however, possible effects on improvement in food variety warrants further detailed investigation.","Munasinghe Sujeeva A, Oliff Carolyn, Finn Judith, Wray John A",Journal of autism and developmental disorders,"Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Child, Preschool, Dietary Supplements, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Papain, Peptide Hydrolases, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20204691,"State Child Development Centre, West Perth, WA, Australia. munass01@student.uwa.edu.au",10.1007/S10803-010-0974-2,,,Digestive enzyme supplementation,"Munasinghe, Sujeeva",Mar-10,Journal of Autism & Developmental Disorders,Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled  - Crossover,6 months,43,"21 M (seq 1), 22 M (seq 2)",3-8 y,2 capsules with each meal (1 capsule recommended to be given with snacks containing gluten or casein),Behavior and communication skills,Global Behaviour Rating Scale (GBRS); Language Development Survery (LDS); Therapist Rating Scale (therapist engagement),"No effect of enzyme treatment on LDS vocabulary or sentence complexity scores, parent behaviour, or therapist engagement.

33,20683766,A pilot randomized controlled trial of omega-3 fatty acids for autism spectrum disorder.,5/1/2011,"We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial to determine the feasibility and initial safety and efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids (1.3 g/day) for the treatment of hyperactivity in 27 children ages 3-8 with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). After 12 weeks, hyperactivity, as measured by the Aberrant Behavior Checklist, improved 2.7 (Â± 4.8) points in the omega-3 group compared to 0.3 (Â± 7.2) points in the placebo group (p = 0.40; effect size = 0.38). Correlations were found between decreases in five fatty acid levels and decreases in hyperactivity, and the treatment was well tolerated. Although this pilot study did not find a statistically significant benefit from omega-3 fatty acids, the small sample size does not rule out small to moderate beneficial effects.","Bent Stephen, Bertoglio Kiah, Ashwood Paul, Bostrom Alan, Hendren Robert L",Journal of autism and developmental disorders,"Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Child, Preschool, Fatty Acids, Omega-3, Female, Humans, Hyperkinesis, Male, Pilot Projects, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20683766,"Osher Center for Integrative Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco VAMC, 111-A1, 4150 Clement St., San Francisco, CA 94121, USA.

Patients (N = 96; 5-17 years), received risperidone (low-dose: 0.125 mg/day [20 to <45 kg], 0.175 mg/day [>45 kg] or high-dose: 1.25 mg/day [20 to <45 kg], 1.75 mg/day [>45 kg]) or placebo. Mean baseline (range 27-29) to endpoint change in Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability (primary endpoint) was significantly greater in the high-dose-(-12.4 [6.5]; p < 0.001), but not low-dose (-7.4 [8.1]; p = 0.164) group, versus placebo (-3.5 [10.7]). Clinical Global Impressions-Severity and Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale scores improved significantly only in the high-dose group, consistent with ABC-I results.

35,26659550,Lurasidone for the Treatment of Irritability Associated with Autistic Disorder.,4/1/2016,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the short-term efficacy and safety of lurasidone in treating irritability associated with autistic disorder. In this multicenter trial, outpatients age 6-17 years who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for autistic disorder, and who demonstrated irritability, agitation, and/or self-injurious behaviors were randomized to 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with lurasidone 20 mg/day (N = 50), 60 mg/day (N = 49), or placebo (N = 51). Efficacy measures included the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability subscale (ABC-I, the primary endpoint) and the Clinical Global Impressions, Improvement (CGI-I) scale, and were analyzed using a likelihood-based mixed model for repeated measures. Least squares (LS) mean (standard error [SE]) improvement from baseline to Week 6 in the ABC-I was not significantly different for lurasidone 20 mg/day (-8.8 [1.5]) and lurasidone 60 mg/day (-9.4 [1.4]) versus placebo (-7.5 [1.5]; p = 0.55 and 0.36, respectively). CGI-I scores showed significantly greater LS mean [SE] improvement at Week 6 for lurasidone 20 mg/day versus placebo (2.8 [0.2] vs. 3.4 [0.2]; p = 0.035) but not for lurasidone 60 mg/day (3.1 [0.2]; p = 0.27). Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were: lurasidone 20 mg/day, 4.1%; 60 mg/day, 3.9%; and placebo, 8.2%. Adverse events with an incidence â¥10% (lurasidone combined, placebo) included vomiting (18.0, 4.1%) and somnolence (12.0, 4.1%). Modest changes were observed in weight and selected metabolic parameters. In this study, once-daily, fixed doses of 20 and 60 mg/day of lurasidone were not demonstrated to be efficacious compared to placebo for the short-term treatment of children and adolescents with moderate-to-severe irritability associated with autistic disorder.","Loebel Antony, Brams Matthew, Goldman Robert S, Silva Robert, Hernandez David, Deng Ling, Mankoski Raymond, Findling Robert L",Journal of autism and developmental disorders,"Adolescent, Antipsychotic Agents, Autistic Disorder, Child, Female, Humans, Irritable Mood, Lurasidone Hydrochloride, Male",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26659550,"Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Fort Lee, NJ, USA.

36,29644582,A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Cross-Over Pilot Study of Riluzole for Drug-Refractory Irritability in Autism Spectrum Disorder.,9/1/2018,"Riluzole is a glutamatergic modulator of particular interest in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover pilot study we evaluated the safety and tolerability of 5-week of adjunctive riluzole treatment (vs. 5-week of placebo, with 2-week washout period) targeting ASD-associated drug-refractory irritability in eight individuals age 12-25 years. All participants tolerated riluzole 200 mg per day, however there were no statistically significant findings for the overall treatment effect, the treatment effect by week within period of the study, or a cross-over effect across the periods of the study on the Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale or the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability subscale. The results of this trial indicate that 5-week of riluzole treatment was well tolerated, but had no significant effect on the target symptoms.

In a phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, we administered 1-mg melatonin (n = 65), 4-mg melatonin (n = 65), or placebo (n = 66) to196 children with ASD once daily before bedtime under adequate sleep hygiene interventions. The primary outcome was sleep onset latency (SOL) assessed with the electronic sleep diary. SOL shortened significantly in the 1- and 4-mg melatonin groups compared to the placebo group (- 22.0, - 28.0, and - 5.0 min, respectively; p < 0.0001 each). This therapeutic regimen of melatonin is a reasonable clinical approach to cope with ASD-emergent difficulties in children with ASD.","Hayashi Masaharu, Mishima Kazuo, Fukumizu Michio, Takahashi Hiroyuki, Ishikawa Yuko, Hamada Izumi, Sugioka Hideyuki, Yotsuya Osamu, Yamashita Yushiro",Journal of autism and developmental disorders,"Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Humans, Melatonin, Sleep, Sleep Hygiene, Sleep Wake Disorders",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34181143,"CMIC Co., Ltd., Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan.; School of Nursing, College of Nursing and Nutrition, Shukutoku University, 673, Nitona-cho, Chuo-ku, Chiba, 260-8703, Japan.

38,23821414,"Riluzole as an adjunctive therapy to risperidone for the treatment of irritability in children with autistic disorder: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial.",12/1/2013,"A hyperglutamatergic state has been shown to play a possible role in the pathophysiology of autistic disorders. Riluzole is a glutamate-modulating agent with neuroprotective properties, which has been shown to have positive effects in many neuropsychiatric disorders. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of riluzole as an adjunctive to risperidone in the treatment of irritability in autistic children who were not optimally responding to previous medications. This was a 10-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial. The study enrolled male and female outpatients aged 5-12 years with a diagnosis of autistic disorder based on the DSM-IV-TR criteria and a score of â¥12 on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) irritability subscale who had discontinued other medications because of a lack of efficacy. Subjects received riluzole (titrated to 50 or 100 mg/day based on bodyweight) or placebo in addition to risperidone (titrated up to 2 or 3 mg/day based on bodyweight) for 10 weeks. Patients were assessed at baseline, week 5, and week 10. The primary outcome measure was the difference in the change in the ABC-C irritability subscale score from baseline to week 10 between the two groups. We also compared changes in other ABC-C subscale scores and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale scores between the two groups. Forty-nine patients were enrolled in the study, and forty children completed the trial (dropouts: placebo = 4, riluzole = 5). A significantly greater improvement in the study primary outcome (the ABC-C irritability subscale score) was achieved by the riluzole-treated children compared with the placebo group (P = 0.03). Patients in the riluzole group also showed significantly greater improvement on the lethargy/social withdrawal (P = 0.02), stereotypic behavior (P = 0.03), and hyperactivity/non-compliance subscales (P = 0.005), but not on the inappropriate speech subscale (P = 0.20) than patients in the placebo group. Eleven patients in the riluzole group and five patients in the placebo group were classified as responders based on their CGI-I scores [Ï(2)(1) = 3.750, P = 0.05]. Children in the riluzole group experienced significantly more increases in their appetite and bodyweight than children in the placebo group by the end of the study. Riluzole add-on therapy shows several therapeutic outcomes, particularly for improving irritability, in children with autism. However, its add-on to risperidone also results in significantly increased appetite and weight gain.","Ghaleiha Ali, Mohammadi Effat, Mohammadi Mohammad-Reza, Farokhnia Mehdi, Modabbernia Amirhossein, Yekehtaz Habibeh, Ashrafi Mandana, Hassanzadeh Elmira, Akhondzadeh Shahin",Paediatric drugs,"Antipsychotic Agents, Appetite, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Double-Blind Method, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Humans, Irritable Mood, Male, Neuroprotective Agents, Riluzole, Risperidone, Treatment Outcome, Weight Gain",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23821414,"Research Center for Behavioral Disorders and Substance Abuse, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran.",10.1007/S40272-013-0036-2,Yes,yes,Risperidone ,"McCracken, James ",1-Aug-02,The New England Journal of Medicine,Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled ,8 weeks ,101,82 M: 19 F,5-17 y; Mean: 8.8 y,0.5-3.5 mg/d; Mean: 1.8 mg/d,Irritability,Abberant Behavior Checklist- Irritability subscale (ABC-I),Treatment with risperidone resulted in a higher rate of reduction in the irritability subscore than placebo. ,Global severity,Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I Score); VABS,The rate of positive response was higher in the risperidone group than the placebo. ,Well tolerated.

39,22342106,A randomized controlled pilot trial of oral N-acetylcysteine in children with autism.,6/1/2012,"An imbalance in the excitatory/inhibitory systems with abnormalities in the glutamatergic pathways has been implicated in the pathophysiology of autism. Furthermore, chronic redox imbalance was also recently linked to this disorder. The goal of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility of using oral N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a glutamatergic modulator and an antioxidant, in the treatment of behavioral disturbance in children with autism. This was a 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of NAC in children with autistic disorder. Subjects randomized to NAC were initiated at 900 mg daily for 4 weeks, then 900 mg twice daily for 4 weeks and 900 mg three times daily for 4 weeks. The primary behavioral measure (Aberrant Behavior Checklist [ABC] irritability subscale) and safety measures were performed at baseline and 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Secondary measures included the ABC stereotypy subscale, Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised, and Social Responsiveness Scale. Thirty-three subjects (31 male subjects, 2 female subjects; aged 3.2-10.7 years) were randomized in the study. Follow-up data was available on 14 subjects in the NAC group and 15 in the placebo group. Oral NAC was well tolerated with limited side effects. Compared with placebo, NAC resulted in significant improvements on ABC irritability subscale (F = 6.80; p < .001; d = .96). Data from this pilot investigation support the potential usefulness of NAC for treating irritability in children with autistic disorder. Large randomized controlled investigations are warranted.","Hardan Antonio Y, Fung Lawrence K, Libove Robin A, Obukhanych Tetyana V, Nair Surekha, Herzenberg Leonore A, Frazier Thomas W, Tirouvanziam Rabindra",Biological psychiatry,"Acetylcysteine, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Double-Blind Method, Female, Free Radical Scavengers, Humans, Irritable Mood, Male, Pilot Projects, Stereotyped Behavior, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22342106,"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, USA. hardanay@stanford.edu",10.1016/J.Biopsych.2012.01.014,Yes,Yes,"N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), oral","Hardan, Antonio",1-Jun-12,Biological Psychiatry ,"RPCT, Pilot",12 weeks,33,31 M: 2 F,"3-10 y, Mean: 7 y","max: 2700mg/d; 900mg/d for the first 4 weeks, 900mg BID  for the next 4 weeks; 900mg 3x/day for the remainder.

40,32289673,"Treatment of Executive Function Deficits in autism spectrum disorder with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation: A double-blind, sham-controlled, pilot trial.",1/1/2020,"In youth and young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), executive function (EF) deficits may be a promising treatment target with potential impact on everyday functioning. To conduct a pilot randomized, double-blind, parallel, controlled trial evaluating repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for EF deficits in ASD. In Toronto, Ontario (November 2014 to June 2017), a 20-session, 4-week course of 20 Hz rTMS targeting dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (90%RMT) was compared to sham stimulation in 16-35 year-olds with ASD (28 male/12 female), without intellectual disability, who had impaired everyday EF performance (n = 20 active/n = 20 sham). Outcome measures evaluated protocol feasibility and clinical effects of active vs. sham rTMS on EF performance. The moderating effect of baseline functioning was explored. Of eligible participants, 95% were enrolled and 95% of randomized participants completed the protocol. Adverse events across treatment arms were mild-to-moderate. There was no significant difference between active vs. sham rTMS on EF performance. Baseline adaptive functioning moderated the effect of rTMS, such that participants with lower baseline functioning experienced significant EF improvement in the active vs. sham group. Our pilot RCT demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of using high frequency rTMS targeting DLPFC in youth and young adults with autism. No evidence for efficacy of active versus sham rTMS on EF performance was found. However, we found promising preliminary evidence of EF performance improvement following active versus sham rTMS in participants with ASD with more severe adaptive functioning deficits. Future work could focus on examining efficacy of rTMS in this higher-need population.

41,22721596,A randomized double-blind study of atomoxetine versus placebo for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorder.,7/1/2012,"The efficacy of atomoxetine as treatment of symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has not been established. In this study, 97 patients aged 6 to 17 years with ADHD and ASD were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with 1.2 mg/kg/day atomoxetine or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) score; secondary endpoints were the Clinical Global Impression of ADHD-Improvement (CGI-I) and the Conners Teacher Rating Scale-Revised: Short Form (CTRS-R:S) score. Baseline mean ADHD-RS scores for atomoxetine versus placebo were 40.7 and 38.6; after 8 weeks, mixed-effect model repeated-measure means were 31.6 (95% confidence interval 29.2-33.9) and 38.3 (36.0-40.6), respectively, with a difference in least square means of -6.7 (-10.0 to -3.4; p < .001). The CTRS-R:S Hyperactivity subscore also improved significantly for atomoxetine compared with placebo, but not the other CTRS-R:S subscores. However, there were not significantly more patients on atomoxetine (20.9%) who improved much, or very much according to the CGI-I, than on placebo (8.7%; p = 0.14). Adverse events (mostly nausea, decrease in appetite, fatigue, and early morning awakening) were reported in 81.3% of atomoxetine patients and 65.3% of placebo patients (p > .1). There were no serious adverse events. Atomoxetine moderately improved ADHD symptoms in patients with ASD and was generally well tolerated. Adverse events in this study were similar to those in other studies with ADHD patients without ASD.

42,26506581,"Atomoxetine, Parent Training, and Their Combination in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.",11/1/2015,"Impairments associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and noncompliance are prevalent in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, ADHD response to stimulants is well below rates in typically developing children, with frequent side effects. Group studies of treatments for noncompliance are rare in ASD. We examined individual and combined-effectiveness of atomoxetine (ATX) and parent training (PT) for ADHD symptoms and noncompliance. In a 3-site, 10-week, double-blind, 2 Ã 2 trial of ATX and PT, 128 children (ages 5-14 years) with ASD and ADHD symptoms were randomized to ATX, ATX+PT, placebo+PT, or placebo. ATX was adjusted to optimal dose (capped at 1.8 mg/kg/day) over 6 weeks and maintained for 4 additional weeks. Nine PT sessions were provided. Primary outcome measures were the parent-rated DSM ADHD symptoms on the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham (SNAP) scale and Home Situations Questionnaire (HSQ). On the SNAP, ATX, ATX+PT and placebo+PT were each superior to placebo (effect sizes 0.57-0.98; p values of .0005, .0004, and .025, respectively). For noncompliance, ATX and ATX+PT were superior to placebo (effect sizes 0.47-0.64; p values .03 and .0028, respectively). ATX was associated with decreased appetite but was otherwise well tolerated. Both ATX and PT resulted in significant improvement on ADHD symptoms, whereas ATX (both alone and combined with PT) was associated with significant decreases on measures of noncompliance. ATX appears to have a better side effects profile than psychostimulants in the population with ASD.

43,29096777,Efficacy and Safety of Pediatric Prolonged-Release Melatonin for Insomnia in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder.,11/1/2017,"To assess the efficacy and safety of novel pediatric-appropriate, prolonged-release melatonin minitablets (PedPRM) versus placebo for insomnia in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with or without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) comorbidity, and neurogenetic disorders (NGD). A total of 125 children and adolescents (2-17.5 years of age; 96.8% ASD, 3.2% Smith-Magenis syndrome [SMS]) whose sleep failed to improve on behavioral intervention alone were randomized (1:1 ratio), double-blind, to receive PedPRM (2 mg escalated to 5 mg) or placebo for 13 weeks. Sleep measures included the validated caregivers' Sleep and Nap Diary (SND) and Composite Sleep Disturbance Index (CSDI). The a priori primary endpoint was SND-reported total sleep time (TST) after 13 weeks of treatment. The study met the primary endpoint: after 13 weeks of double-blind treatment, participants slept on average 57.5 minutes longer at night with PedPRM compared to 9.14 minutes with placebo (adjusted mean treatment difference PedPRM-placebo -32.43 minutes; p = .034). Sleep latency (SL) decreased by 39.6 minutes on average with PedPRM and 12.5 minutes with placebo (adjusted mean treatment difference -25.30 minutes; p = .011) without causing earlier wakeup time. The rate of participants attaining clinically meaningful responses in TST and/or SL was significantly higher with PedPRM than with placebo (68.9% versus 39.3% respectively; p = .001) corresponding to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 3.38. Overall sleep disturbance (CSDI) tended to decrease. PedPRM was generally safe; somnolence was more commonly reported with PedPRM than placebo. PedPRM was efficacious and safe for treatment of insomnia in children and adolescents with ASD with/without ADHD and NGD. The acceptability of this pediatric formulation in a population who usually experience significant difficulties in swallowing was remarkably high.

We tested efficacy of bumetanide on core symptom domains using a single center, parallel-group, participant-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase-2 superiority trial in a tertiary hospital in the Netherlands. Unmedicated children aged 7 to 15 years with ASD and IQ â¥55 were block-randomized 1:1 to oral-solution bumetanide versus placebo, titrated to a maximum of 1.0 mg twice daily for 91 days (D91), followed by a 28-day wash-out period. The primary outcome was difference in Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2) total score at D91, analyzed by modified intention-to-treat with linear mixed models. A total of 92 participants (mean age 10.5 [SD 2.4] years) enrolled between June 2016 and December 2018. In all, 47 children were allocated to bumetanide and 45 to placebo. Two participants dropped out per treatment arm. After 91 days, bumetanide was not superior to placebo on the primary outcome, the SRS-2 (mean difference -3.16, 95% CI = -9.68 to 3.37, p = .338). A superior effect was found on one of the secondary outcomes, the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (mean difference -4.16, 95% CI = -8.06 to -0.25, p = .0375), but not on the Sensory Profile (mean difference 5.64, 95% CI = -11.30 to 22.57, p = .508) or the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability Subscale (mean difference -0.65, 95% CI = -2.83 to 1.52, p = .552). No significant wash-out effect was observed. Significant adverse effects were predominantly diuretic effects (orthostatic hypotension (17 [36%] versus 5 [11%], p = .007); hypokalemia (24 [51%] versus 0 [0%], p < .0001), the occurrence of which did not statistically influence treatment outcome. The trial outcome was negative in terms of no superior effect on the primary outcome. The secondary outcomes suggest efficacy on repetitive behavior symptoms for a subset of patients.

45,26746121,Efficacy of Low-Dose Buspirone for Restricted and Repetitive Behavior in Young Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Randomized Trial.,3/1/2016,"To determine safety and efficacy of the 5HT1A serotonin partial agonist buspirone on core autism and associated features in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Children 2-6 years of age with ASD (N = 166) were randomized to receive placebo or 2.5 or 5.0 mg of buspirone twice daily. The primary objective was to evaluate the effects of 24 weeks of buspirone on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) Composite Total Score. Secondary objectives included evaluating the effects of buspirone on social competence, repetitive behaviors, language, sensory dysfunction, and anxiety and to assess side effects. Positron emission tomography measures of tryptophan metabolism and blood serotonin concentrations were assessed as predictors of buspirone efficacy. There was no difference in the ADOS Composite Total Score between baseline and 24 weeks among the 3 treatment groups (P = .400); however, the ADOS Restricted and Repetitive Behavior score showed a time-by-treatment effect (P = .006); the 2.5-mg buspirone group showed significant improvement (P = .003), whereas placebo and 5.0-mg buspirone groups showed no change. Children in the 2.5-mg buspirone group were more likely to improve if they had fewer foci of increased brain tryptophan metabolism on positron emission tomography (P = .018) or if they showed normal levels of blood serotonin (P = .044). Adverse events did not differ significantly among treatment groups. Treatment with 2.5 mg of buspirone in young children with ASD might be a useful adjunct therapy to target restrictive and repetitive behaviors in conjunction with behavioral interventions.

46,25451017,A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial of adjuvant buspirone for irritability in autism ,10/4/2014,"Background: The brain serotonin level is decreased in individuals with autism. Buspirone is a 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist with antiaggressive effects increasing prosocial behaviors. Methods: We conducted an 8-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial. Participants included 40 outpatient children and adolescents with autism. The patients took buspirone plus risperidone or risperidone plus placebo during 8 weeks. The patients were assessed at baseline, week 4, and week 8 using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Rating Scale. Results: Eighteen patients in the placebo group and 16 patients in the buspirone group completed this trial. The mean dose of buspirone was 6.7 (SD 2.7) mg/day. Irritability subscale score significantly decreased during this trial in both groups (buspirone group: declined from 25.7 [SD 5.7] to 16.3 [SD 8.5]; placebo group: declined from 24.7 [SD 7.6] to 18.2 [SD 7.7]). The Cohen d effect size was .45. Thirteen (81.2%) of 16 patients in the buspirone group and 7 (38.9%) of 18 patients in the placebo group showed a â¥30% decline in irritability score. The relative risk for treatment was 2.1. There were no serious adverse effects. The most common adverse effects in the buspirone group were increased appetite, drowsiness, and fatigue.

47,25451017,A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial of adjuvant buspirone for irritability in autism.,1/1/2015,"The brain serotonin level is decreased in individuals with autism. Buspirone is a 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist with antiaggressive effects increasing prosocial behaviors. We conducted an 8-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial. Participants included 40 outpatient children and adolescents with autism. The patients took buspirone plus risperidone or risperidone plus placebo during 8 weeks. The patients were assessed at baseline, week 4, and week 8 using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Rating Scale. Eighteen patients in the placebo group and 16 patients in the buspirone group completed this trial. The mean dose of buspirone was 6.7 (SD 2.7) mg/day. Irritability subscale score significantly decreased during this trial in both groups (buspirone group: declined from 25.7 [SD 5.7] to 16.3 [SD 8.5]; placebo group: declined from 24.7 [SD 7.6] to 18.2 [SD 7.7]). The Cohen d effect size was .45. Thirteen (81.2%) of 16 patients in the buspirone group and 7 (38.9%) of 18 patients in the placebo group showed a â¥30% decline in irritability score. The relative risk for treatment was 2.1. There were no serious adverse effects. The most common adverse effects in the buspirone group were increased appetite, drowsiness, and fatigue. This clinical trial supports that low dose buspirone plus risperidone is more effective than risperidone plus placebo for treating irritability in individuals with autism.","Ghanizadeh Ahmad, Ayoobzadehshirazi Anaheed",Pediatric neurology,"Ambulatory Care, Autistic Disorder, Buspirone, Child, Double-Blind Method, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Humans, Irritable Mood, Male, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Psychotropic Drugs, Risperidone, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25451017,"Research Center for Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.; Research Center for Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran; Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran; Department of Neuroscience, School of Advanced Medical Sciences and Technologies, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.

48,19772883,Double-blind placebo-controlled trial of pentoxifylline added to risperidone: effects on aberrant behavior in children with autism.,2/1/2010,"There are several lines of evidence to indicate that the immune system plays an important role in the pathophysiology of autism. The objective of this study was to access the effects of pentoxifylline plus risperidone in the treatment of autistic disorder. Forty children between the ages 4 and 12 years with a DSM IV-TR clinical diagnosis of autism were recruited. The children presented with a chief complaint of severely disruptive symptoms related to autistic disorder. Patients were randomly allocated to pentoxifylline+risperidone or placebo+risperidone for a 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The dose of risperidone was titrated up to 3 mg/day, pentoxifylline was titrated to 600 mg/day. Patients were assessed at baseline and after 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks of starting medication. The measure of the outcome was the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C). The difference between the two protocols was significant as the group that received pentoxifylline had greater reduction in ABC-C subscale scores for Irritability, Lethargy/Social Withdrawal, Stereotypic Behavior, Hyperactivity/Noncompliance and Inappropriate Speech. The results suggest that combination of atypical antipsychotic medications and pentoxifylline might have synergistic effects in treatment of behavioral problems of children with autism.","Akhondzadeh

49,20637249,"Double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of risperidone plus topiramate in children with autistic disorder.",10/1/2010,"Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that forms part of a spectrum of related disorders referred to as Autism Spectrum Disorders. The present study assessed the effects of topiramate plus risperidone in the treatment of autistic disorder. Forty children between the ages of 4 and 12 years with a DSM IV clinical diagnosis of autism who were outpatients from a specialty clinic for children were recruited. The children presented with a chief complaint of severely disruptive symptoms related to autistic disorder. Patients were randomly allocated to topiramate+risperidone (Group A) or placebo+risperidone (Group B) for an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The dose of risperidone was titrated up to 2 mg/day for children between 10 and 40 kg and 3 mg/day for children weighting above 40 kg. The dose of topiramate was titrated up to 200 mg/day depending on weight (100 mg/day for <30 kg and 200 mg/day for >30 kg). Patients were assessed at baseline and after 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after starting medication. Measure of outcome was the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) Rating Scale. Difference between the two protocols was significant as the group that received topiramate had a greater reduction in ABC-C subscale scores for irritability, stereotypic behavior and hyperactivity/noncompliance. The results suggest that the combination of topiramate with risperidone may be superior to risperidone monotherapy for children with autistic disorder. However the results need to be further confirmed by a larger randomized controlled trial.","Rezaei Vala, Mohammadi Mohammad-Reza, Ghanizadeh Ahmad, Sahraian Ali, Tabrizi Mina, Rezazadeh Shams-Ali, Akhondzadeh Shahin",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,"Antipsychotic Agents, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Double-Blind Method, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Fructose, Humans, Male, Neuroprotective Agents, Neuropsychological Tests, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Retrospective Studies, Risperidone, Severity of Illness Index, Topiramate, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20637249,"Research Center for Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Hafez Hospital, Shiraz, Iran.",10.1016/J.Pnpbp.2010.07.005,Yes (risperidone) No (topiramate),Yes (risperidone) No (topiramate),Risperidone + Topiramate ,"Rezaei, Vala",Jul-10,Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry,Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled ,8 weeks ,40,27 M: 13 F,4-12 y ,Risperidone: 2 mg/d for pts under 40 kg and 3 mg/d for pt 40 kgo; Topirimate: 100 mg/d for pts under 30kg and 200 mg/d for pt 30 kgo,,ABC-C ,"The topiramate & risperidone treatment group had greater reductions in the irritability, hyperactivity/noncompliance, and stereotypy subscales.

50,26361994,Using venlafaxine to treat behavioral disorders in patients with autism spectrum disorder.,2/4/2016,"To test the efficacy of venlafaxine at a dose of 18.75 mg/day on the reduction of behavioral problems such as irritability and hyperactivity/noncompliance in patients with intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Our secondary hypothesis was that the usual doses of zuclopenthixol and/or clonazepam would decrease in the venlafaxine-treated group. In a randomized double-blind study, we compared six patients who received venlafaxine along with their usual treatment (zuclopenthixol and/or clonazepam) with seven patients who received placebo plus usual care. Irritability, hyperactivity/noncompliance, and overall clinical improvement were measured after 2 and 8 weeks, using validated clinical scales. Univariate analyses showed that the symptom of irritability improved in the entire sample (p = 0.023 after 2 weeks, p = 0.061 at study endpoint), although no difference was observed between the venlafaxine and placebo groups. No significant decrease in hyperactivity/noncompliance was observed during the study. At the end of the study, global improvement was observed in 33% of participants treated with venlafaxine and in 71% of participants in the placebo group (p = 0.29). The study found that decreased cumulative doses of clonazepam and zuclopenthixol were required for the venlafaxine group. Multivariate analyses (principal component analyses) with at least three combinations of variables showed that the two populations could be clearly separated (p b 0.05). Moreover, in all cases, the venlafaxine population had lower values for the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Behavior Problems Inventory (BPI), and levels of urea with respect to the placebo group. In one case, a reduction in the dosage of clonazepam was also suggested. For an additional set of variables (ABC factor 2, BPI frequency of aggressive behaviors, hematic ammonia at Day 28, and zuclopenthixol and clonazepam intake), the separation between the two samples was statistically significant as was the Bartlett's test, but the KaiserâMeyerâOlkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy was below the accepted threshold. This set of variables showed a reduction in the cumulative intake of both zuclopenthixol and clonazepam. Despite the small sample sizes, this study documented a statistically significant effect of venlafaxine. Moreover, we showed that lower doses of zuclopenthixol and clonazepam were needed in the venlafaxine group, although this difference was not statistically significant. This was confirmed by multivariate analyses, where this difference reached statistical significance when using a combination of variables involving zuclopenthixol. Larger-scale studies are recommended to better investigate the effectiveness of venlafaxine treatment in patients with intellectual disabilities and ASD.","Carminati Giuliana Galli, Gerber Fabienne, Darbellay Barbara, Kosel Markus Mathaus, Deriaz Nicolas, Chabert Jocelyne, Fathi Marc, Bertschy Gilles, Ferrero FranÃ§ois, Carminati Federico",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,"Adolescent, Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Clonazepam, Clopenthixol, Double-Blind Method, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Humans, Male, Multivariate Analysis, Psychotropic Drugs, Treatment Outcome, Venlafaxine Hydrochloride, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26361994,"Service de PÃ©diatrie, Clinique des Grangettes, Chemin des Grangettes 7, 1224 ChÃªne-Bougeries, Switzerland.; Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (SNUBH), Seoul, Republic of Korea.

51,36654288,"Improved symptoms following bumetanide treatment in children aged 3-6 years with autism spectrum disorder: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.",8/15/2021,"With the current limited drug therapy for the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), we herein report a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy, safety, and potential neural mechanism of bumetanide in children with ASD aged 3-6 years old. A total of 120 children were enrolled into the study and randomly assigned to either 0.5 mg bumetanide or placebo. In the final sample, 119 children received at least one dose of bumetanide (59 children) or placebo (60 children) were included in the final analysis. The primary outcome was a reduction in the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) score, and the secondary outcomes were the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI) -Global Improvement (CGI-I) score at 3 months and the change from baseline to 3-month in the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to measure Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate neurotransmitter concentrations in the insular cortex (IC) before and after the treatment. As compared with the placebo, bumetanide treatment was significantly better in reducing the severity. No patient withdrew from the trial due to adverse events. The superiority of bumetanide to placebo in reducing insular GABA, measured using MRS, was demonstrated. The clinical improvement was associated with a decrease in insular GABA in the bumetanide group. In conclusion, this trial in a large group of young children with predominantly moderate and severe ASD demonstrated that bumetanide is safe and effective in improving the core symptoms of ASD. However, the clinical significance remains uncertain, and future multi-center clinical trials are required to replicate these findings and confirm the clinical significance using a variety of outcome measures.","Dai Yuan, Zhang Lingli, Yu Juehua, Zhou Xin, He Hua, Ji Yiting, Wang Kai, Du Xiujuan, Liu Xin, Tang Yun, Deng Shining, Langley Christelle, Li Wei-Guang, Zhang Jun, Feng Jianfeng, Sahakian Barbara J, Luo Qiang, Li Fei",Science bulletin,"Humans, Child, Child, Preschool, Bumetanide, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Glutamic Acid, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36654288,"Department of Developmental and Behavioural Pediatric & Child Primary Care, Brain and Behavioural Research Unit of Shanghai Institute for Pediatric Research and MOE-Shanghai Key Laboratory for Children's Environmental Health, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200092, China; Department of Psychiatry and the Behavioural and Clinical Neuroscience Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB21TN, UK; Institute of Science and Technology for Brain-Inspired Intelligence, Ministry of Education-Key Laboratory of Computational Neuroscience and Brain-Inspired Intelligence and Research and Research Institute of Intelligent Complex Systems, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China.; Clinical Research Unit, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200092, China.; Collaborative Innovation Center for Brain Science, Department of Anatomy and Physiology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.; Institute of Science and Technology for Brain-Inspired Intelligence, Ministry of Education-Key Laboratory of Computational Neuroscience and Brain-Inspired Intelligence and Research and Research Institute of Intelligent Complex Systems, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China; State Key Laboratory of Medical Neurobiology and Ministry of Education Frontiers Center for Brain Science, Institutes of Brain Science and National Clinical Research Center for Aging and Medicine, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200040, China.

53,16316486,Divalproex sodium vs. placebo in the treatment of repetitive behaviours in autism spectrum disorder.,4/1/2006,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairment in three core symptom domains: socialization, communication, and repetitive/stereotyped behaviours. Other associated symptom domains are also affected including impulsivity/aggression, self-injury, anxiety, and mood lability. Divalproex has been shown to have efficacy in treating epilepsy, bipolar disorder, mood lability, and impulsive aggression. The present study evaluated the use of divalproex in the treatment of repetitive, compulsive-like symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Thirteen individuals with ASD participated in an 8-wk, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of divalproex sodium vs. placebo. There was a significant group difference on improvement in repetitive behaviours as measured by the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (C-YBOCS) (p=0.037) and a large effect size (d=1.616). This study provides preliminary support for the use of divalproex in treating repetitive behaviours in ASD. Further research is needed to evaluate the specificity and mechanism of action of these findings.","Hollander Eric, Soorya Latha, Wasserman Stacey, Esposito Katherine, Chaplin William, Anagnostou

54,22999292,"Memantine as adjunctive treatment to risperidone in children with autistic disorder: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.",5/1/2013,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that causes significant impairment in socialization and communication. It is also associated with ritualistic and stereotypical behaviour. Recent studies propose both hyper-and hypoglutamatergic ideologies for autism. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of memantine plus risperidone in the treatment of children with autism. Children with autism were randomly allocated to risperidone plus memantine or placebo plus risperidone for a 10-wk, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The dose of risperidone was titrated up to 3 mg/d and memantine was titrated to 20 mg/d. Children were assessed at baseline and after 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 wk of starting medication protocol. The primary outcome measure was the irritability subscale of Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C). Difference between the two treatment arms was significant as the group that received memantine had greater reduction in ABC-C subscale scores for irritability, stereotypic behaviour and hyperactivity. Eight side-effects were observed over the trial, out of the 25 side-effects that the checklist included. The difference between the two groups in the frequency of side-effects was not significant. The present study suggests that memantine may be a potential adjunctive treatment strategy for autism and it was generally well tolerated. This trial is registered with the Iranian Clinical Trials Registry (IRCT1138901151556N10; www.irct.ir).","Ghaleiha Ali, Asadabadi Mahtab, Mohammadi Mohammad-Reza, Shahei Maryam, Tabrizi Mina, Hajiaghaee Reza, Hassanzadeh Elmira, Akhondzadeh Shahin",The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology,"Autistic Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Double-Blind Method, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Humans, Male, Memantine, Risperidone, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22999292,"Research Center for Behavioral Disorders and Substance Abuse, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran.",10.1017/S1461145712000880,Yes (memantine peppermint) ,,Memantine + Risperidone,"Ghaleiha, Ali",5/1/2013,International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology,Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled ,10 weeks,40,23 M: 17 F,4-12 y; mean: ~7.5 y,"risperidone- 2 mg/d & memantine- max: 15 mg/d for pt 10-40 kg, 20 mg/d for pt 40 kgo, or + placebo",Irritability,ABC-C Irritability,Significantly greater reduction in irritability scores in memantine tx group than placebo.,"Lethargy/social withdrawal, stereotypy, and hyperactivity/noncompliance",ABC-C: all other subscales. ,Significantly greater reduction in scores for hyperactivity and stereotypic bx.,Well tolerated.

55,11055460,Efficacy of methylphenidate among children with autism and symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.,6/1/2000,"Thirteen children (ages 5.6 to 11.2 years) with autism and symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of methylphenidate (0.3 and 0.6 mg/kg per dose). Eight subjects responded positively, based upon a minimum 50% decrease on the Conners Hyperactivity Index. Ratings of stereotypy and inappropriate speech, which are often associated with autistic core features, also decreased. However, no changes were found on the Child Autism Rating Scale, a global assessment of autistic symptomotology. Significant adverse side effects occurred in some children including social withdrawal and irritability, especially at the 0.6 mg/kg dose. Results suggest that methylphenidate can be efficacious for children with autism and ADHD symptoms. However, this group of children seems to be particularly susceptible to adverse side effects.","Handen B L, Johnson C R, Lubetsky M",Journal of autism and developmental disorders,"Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity, Autistic Disorder, Central Nervous System Stimulants, Child, Child, Preschool, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Methylphenidate",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11055460,"University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pennsylvania, USA.",10.1023/A:1005548619694,"Yes (grape, banana)","Chewable tablets (cherry, grape)",Methylphenidate,"Handen, BL",2000,Journal of Autism & Developmental Disorders,"double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over",3 weeks,13,10 M: 3 F,5.6-11.2 y (m: 7.4 y),0.3 mg/kg and 0.6 mg/kg 2-3x per day,Hyperactivity,Conners' Teacher Rating Scale (CTRS); IOWA Conners' Teacher Rating Scale ,,Severity,CARS; ABC,,,,n=1,7 African American; 4 white; 2 Latino,,Unclear risk - method of sequence generation not described,unclear risk - method of concealment not reported,low risk - All outcome assessors blinded,"unclear risk - All parents and participants were blinded.

56,11450816,"Lamotrigine therapy for autistic disorder: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.",4/1/2001,"In autism, glutamate may be increased or its receptors up-regulated as part of an excitotoxic process that damages neural networks and subsequently contributes to behavioral and cognitive deficits seen in the disorder. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study of lamotrigine, an agent that modulates glutamate release. Twenty-eight children (27 boys) ages 3 to 11 years (M = 5.8) with a primary diagnosis of autistic disorder received either placebo or lamotrigine twice daily. In children on lamotrigine, the drug was titrated upward over 8 weeks to reach a mean maintenance dose of 5.0 mg/kg per day. This dose was then maintained for 4 weeks. Following maintenance evaluations, the drug was tapered down over 2 weeks. The trial ended with a 4-week drug-free period. Outcome measures included improvements in severity and behavioral features of autistic disorder (stereotypies, lethargy, irritability, hyperactivity, emotional reciprocity, sharing pleasures) and improvements in language and communication, socialization, and daily living skills noted after 12 weeks (the end of a 4-week maintenance phase). We did not find any significant differences in improvements between lamotrigine or placebo groups on the Autism Behavior Checklist, the Aberrant Behavior Checklist, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior scales, the PL-ADOS, or the CARS. Parent rating scales showed marked improvements, presumably due to expectations of benefits.","Belsito K M, Law P A, Kirk K S, Landa R J, Zimmerman A W",Journal of autism and developmental disorders,"Analysis of Variance, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child Behavior, Child, Preschool, Double-Blind Method, Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists, Female, Glutamic Acid, Humans, Lamotrigine, Male, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Triazines",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11450816,"The Center for Autism and Related Disorders, Kennedy Krieger Institute, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.",10.1023/A:1010799115457,No,Yes,Lamotrigine,"Belsito, Karin M.",2001,Journal of Autism & Developmental Disorders,Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled  - Parallel,18 weeks ,28,27 M:1 F,3-11 y; mean: 5.8 y,mean: 5.0 mg/kg/d,,"ABC, Autism Bx Checklist, Vineland Bx Scales, PL-ADOS, or CARS",No significant results in diference between tx groups.,,,,Insomnia and hyperactivity.

57,27752075,Folinic acid improves verbal communication in children with autism and language impairment: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial.,2/1/2018,"We sought to determine whether high-dose folinic acid improves verbal communication in children with non-syndromic autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and language impairment in a double-blind placebo control setting. Forty-eight children (mean age 7 years 4 months; 82% male) with ASD and language impairment were randomized to receive 12 weeks of high-dose folinic acid (2 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> per day, maximum 50 mg per day; n=23) or placebo (n=25). Children were subtyped by glutathione and folate receptor-Î± autoantibody (FRAA) status. Improvement in verbal communication, as measured by a ability-appropriate standardized instrument, was significantly greater in participants receiving folinic acid as compared with those receiving placebo, resulting in an effect of 5.7 (1.0,10.4) standardized points with a medium-to-large effect size (Cohen's d=0.70). FRAA status was predictive of response to treatment. For FRAA-positive participants, improvement in verbal communication was significantly greater in those receiving folinic acid as compared with those receiving placebo, resulting in an effect of 7.3 (1.4,13.2) standardized points with a large effect size (Cohen's d=0.91), indicating that folinic acid treatment may be more efficacious in children with ASD who are FRAA positive. Improvements in subscales of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, the Aberrant Behavior Checklist, the Autism Symptom Questionnaire and the Behavioral Assessment System for Children were significantly greater in the folinic acid group as compared with the placebo group. There was no significant difference in adverse effects between treatment groups. Thus, in this small trial of children with non-syndromic ASD and language impairment, treatment with high-dose folinic acid for 12 weeks resulted in improvement in verbal communication as compared with placebo, particularly in those participants who were positive for FRAAs.","Frye R E, Slattery J, Delhey L, Furgerson B, Strickland T, Tippett M, Sailey A, Wynne R, Rose S, Melnyk S, Jill James S, Sequeira J M, Quadros E V",Molecular psychiatry,"Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Child, Preschool, Double-Blind Method, Female, Folate Receptor 1, Humans, Language Development Disorders, Language Disorders, Leucovorin, Male, Placebo Effect, Receptors, Peptide, Treatment Outcome, Verbal Behavior",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27752075,"Arkansas Children's Research Institute, Little Rock, AR, USA.; Department of Medicine, State University of New York - Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA.; Arkansas Children's Hospital, Little Rock, AR, USA.",10.1038/Mp.2016.168,,,Folinic acid (high-dose),"Frye, RE",18-Oct-16,Molecular Psychiatry,Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled ,12 weeks,48,82% M,Mean: 7 y,"5, 10, or 25mg; Max: 50mg/day",Verbal communication.,"Verbal Communication.

58,20010551,Divalproex sodium vs placebo for the treatment of irritability in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders.,3/1/2010,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by social and language deficits and by repetitive behaviors and interests. Irritability/aggression is a significant comorbid symptom in this population, which greatly impacts burden of care. This study examined the effect of divalproex sodium for irritability/aggression in children and adolescents with ASD. This was a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. All efficacy measures were obtained by an independent evaluator blinded to randomization condition and side effects. A total of 55 subjects gavetheir consent and 27 were randomized in a 1 : 1 manner (mean age 9.46+/-2.46, mean nonverbal IQ 63.3+/-23.9). Two subjects from the active group and one subject from the placebo group discontinued the study because of either a lack of efficacy or side effects (increased irritability). Primary outcome measures were Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability subscale and Clinical Global Impression-Improvement, which focused on irritability. Overall, 62.5% of divalproex subjects vs 9% of placebo subjects were responders (CGI-irritability OR: 16.7, Fisher's exact p=0.008). A statistically significant improvement was also noted on the ABC-Irritability subscale (p=0.048). There was a trend for responders to have higher valproate blood levels compared with nonresponders. This study suggests the efficacy of divalproex for the treatment of irritability in children and adolescents with ASD. Larger sample follow-up studies are warranted.","Hollander Eric, Chaplin William, Soorya Latha, Wasserman Stacey, Novotny Sherry, Rusoff Jade, Feirsen Nicole, Pepa Lauren, Anagnostou Evdokia",Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,"Adolescent, Antimanic Agents, Child, Child Behavior Disorders, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Child, Preschool, Double-Blind Method, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Irritable Mood, Male, Personality Assessment, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Treatment Outcome, Valproic Acid",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20010551,"Department of Psychiatry, Montefiore Medical Center University Hospital for Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Child Psychiatry Annex, Bronx, NY 10467-2490, USA. eholland@montefiore.org",10.1038/Npp.2009.202,Yes (cherry),Yes,Divalproex Sodium (Valproate),"Hollander, Eric",9-Dec-09,Neuropsychopharmacology,Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled  ,12 weeks,27,23 M: 4 F,5-15 y; Mean: 9.5 y,Titrated up according to body weight.

59,27748740,"Arbaclofen in Children and Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Randomized, Controlled, Phase 2 Trial.",6/1/2017,"Several lines of emerging data point to an imbalance between neuronal excitation and inhibition in at least a subgroup of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including in those with fragile X syndrome (FXS), one of the most common genetic syndromes within ASD. In animal models of FXS and of ASD, GABA-B agonists have improved both brain and behavioral phenotypes, including social behavior. A phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial found that the GABA-B agonist arbaclofen improved social avoidance symptoms in FXS. A pilot open-label trial of arbaclofen suggested similar benefits in ASD. We therefore evaluated arbaclofen in a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study of 150 participants, aged 5-21 years, with ASD. No difference from placebo was detected on the primary outcome measure, the parent-rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist Social Withdrawal/Lethargy subscale. However, a specified secondary analysis found improvement on the clinician-rated Clinical Global Impression of Severity. An exploratory post hoc analysis of participants with a consistent rater across the trial revealed greater improvement in the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales II socialization domain in participants receiving arbaclofen. Affect lability (11%) and sedation (9%) were the most common adverse events. In this exploratory study, secondary analyses suggest that arbaclofen may have the potential to improve symptoms in some children with ASD, but further study will be needed to replicate and extend these initial findings.","Veenstra-VanderWeele Jeremy, Cook Edwin H, King Bryan H, Zarevics Peter, Cherubini Maryann, Walton-Bowen Karen, Bear Mark F, Wang Paul P, Carpenter Randall L",Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,"Adolescent, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Baclofen, Child, Child, Preschool, Cross-Over Studies, Female, GABA-B Receptor Agonists, Humans, Male, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27748740,"Autism Speaks, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.; The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative, New York, NY, USA.; Seaside Therapeutics, Cambridge, MA, USA.",10.1038/Npp.2016.237,Yes,No,Arbaclofen,"Veenstra-VanderWeele, Jeremy",9-Nov-16,Neuropsychopharmacology,Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled  ,12 weeks ,150,124 M: 26 F,5-21 y; mean: 11 y,,Social behaviors. ,ABC-C Social withdrawal/Lethargy,No significant difference between the arbaclofen and placebo tx groups. ,"Social behaviors, irritability, anxiety, attention/hyperactivity.

60,29955161,Effect of intranasal oxytocin on the core social symptoms of autism spectrum disorder: a randomized clinical trial.,8/1/2020,"Although small-scale studies have described the effects of oxytocin on social deficits in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), no large-scale study has been conducted. In this randomized, parallel-group, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in Japan, 106 ASD individuals (18-48 y.o.) were enrolled between Jan 2015 and March 2016. Participants were randomly assigned to a 6-week intranasal oxytocin (48IU/day, n = 53) or placebo (n = 53) group. One-hundred-three participants were analyzed. Since oxytocin reduced the primary endpoint, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) reciprocity, (from 8.5 to 7.7; P < .001) but placebo also reduced the score (8.3 to 7.2; P < .001), no between-group difference was found (effect size -0.08; 95% CI, -0.46 to 0.31; P = .69); however, plasma oxytocin was only elevated from baseline to endpoint in the oxytocin-group compared with the placebo-group (effect size -1.12; -1.53 to -0.70; P < .0001). Among the secondary endpoints, oxytocin reduced ADOS repetitive behavior (2.0 to 1.5; P < .0001) compared with placebo (2.0 to 1.8; P = .43) (effect size 0.44; 0.05 to 0.83; P = .026). In addition, the duration of gaze fixation on socially relevant regions, another secondary endpoint, was increased by oxytocin (41.2 to 52.3; P = .03) compared with placebo (45.7 to 40.4; P = .25) (effect size 0.55; 0.10 to 1.0; P = .018). No significant effects were observed for the other secondary endpoints. No significant difference in the prevalence of adverse events was observed between groups, although one participant experienced temporary gynecomastia during oxytocin administration. Based on the present findings, we cannot recommend continuous intranasal oxytocin treatment alone at the current dose and duration for treatment of the core social symptoms of high-functioning ASD in adult men, although this large-scale trial suggests oxytocin's possibility to treat ASD repetitive behavior.","Yamasue Hidenori, Okada Takashi, Munesue Toshio, Kuroda Miho, Fujioka Toru, Uno Yota, Matsumoto Kaori, Kuwabara Hitoshi, Mori Daisuke, Okamoto Yuko, Yoshimura Yuko, Kawakubo Yuki, Arioka Yuko, Kojima Masaki, Yuhi Teruko, Owada Keiho, Yassin Walid, Kushima Itaru, Benner Seico, Ogawa Nanayo, Eriguchi Yosuke, Kawano Naoko, Uemura Yukari, Yamamoto Maeri, Kano Yukiko, Kasai Kiyoto, Higashida Haruhiro, Ozaki Norio, Kosaka Hirotaka",Molecular psychiatry,"Administration, Intranasal, Adolescent, Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Double-Blind Method, Gynecomastia, Humans, Japan, Male, Middle Aged, Oxytocin, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29955161,"Department of Psychiatry, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashiku, Hamamatsu City, 431-3192, Japan. yamasue@hama-med.ac.jp.; Graduate School of Psychology, Kanazawa Institute of Technology, 7-1 Ohgigaoka, Nonoichi, 921-8054, Japan.; Department of Psychiatry, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, 65 Tsurumai-cho, Showa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, 466-8550, Japan.; Research Center for Child Mental Development, University of Fukui, Eiheiji, Fukui, 910-1193, Japan.; Department of Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.; Department of Child Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.; Research Center for Child Mental Development, Kanazawa University, 13-1 Takara-machi, Kanazawa, 920-8640, Japan.; Biostatistics Division, Clinical Research Support Center, University of Tokyo Hospital, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.",10.1038/S41380-018-0097-2,,,Oxytocin ,"Yamasue, Hidenori",2020,Molecular Psychiatry,Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled  ,6 weeks,106,,18-48 y,48 IU/d,,ADOS; oxytocin plasma levels,"Both placebo and oxytocin treatment groups had reduced scores, no treatment difference.

61,35241779,"A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial of mirtazapine for anxiety in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder.",5/1/2022,"This study was a 10-week double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial of mirtazapine for anxiety in youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Participants were ages 5 to 17 years with ASD and clinically significant anxiety (Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale [PARS] score â¥10). Thirty participants were randomized to mirtazapine (7.5-45 mg/day) or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. The co-primary outcome measures were the PARS and the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement subscale (CGI-I). Mirtazapine resulted in a statistically significant within group decrease in anxiety on the PARS (ES 1.76, p < 0.001). The improvement in PARS score for mirtazapine versus placebo was clinically meaningful but not statistically significant (ES = 0.63, p = 0.64). Forty-seven percent of participants assigned to mirtazapine (95% CI 22%: 74%) and 20% assigned to placebo (95% CI 2%: 60%) were rated ""much improved"" (CGI-I = 2) or ""very much improved"" (CGI-I = 1) for anxiety, p = 0.46. No statistically significant differences in mean 10-week changes between mirtazapine and placebo occurred on any outcome measure. There were no statistically significant differences in adverse effect frequency between mirtazapine and placebo. The results are consistent with mirtazapine's safety and tolerability and meet three of four pre-specified indicators of efficacy (statistically significant change in total PARS score for mirtazapine, numerically greater reduction in total PARS score for mirtazapine than placebo, numerically higher number of responders to mirtazapine than placebo, but not greater than 50% of participants receiving mirtazapine rated as responders). Implementation of a larger randomized controlled trial of mirtazapine for the treatment of anxiety in this population is supported.Clinical trial registration information: Mirtazapine Treatment of Anxiety in Children and Adolescents with Pervasive Developmental Disorders; https://clinicaltrials.gov ; NCT01302964.","McDougle Christopher J, Thom Robyn P, Ravichandran Caitlin T, Palumbo Michelle L, Politte Laura C, Mullett Jennifer E, Keary Christopher J, Erickson Craig A, Stigler Kimberly A, Mathieu-Frasier Lauren, Posey David J",Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,"Adolescent, Anxiety, Anxiety Disorders, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Double-Blind Method, Humans, Mirtazapine, Pilot Projects, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35241779,"Massachusetts General Hospital, 55 Fruit St, Boston, MA, 02114, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, USA.; Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, Cincinnati, USA.; WakeMed Children's Pediatric Behavioral Health, 3000 New Bern Ave, Raleigh, NC, 27610, USA.; Massachusetts General Hospital, 55 Fruit St, Boston, MA, 02114, USA. cmcdougle@mgh.harvard.edu.",10.1038/S41386-022-01295-4,No,Yes,Mirtazapine,"McDougle, Christopher J.

62,15602505,A placebo controlled crossover trial of liquid fluoxetine on repetitive behaviors in childhood and adolescent autism.,3/1/2005,"Repetitive behaviors are a core symptom domain in autism that has been linked to alterations in the serotonin system. While the selective serotonin-receptive inhibitor fluvoxamine has been shown to be effective in adults with autism, as yet no published placebo controlled trials with these agents document safety and efficacy in children with autism. This study examines the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor liquid fluoxetine in the treatment of repetitive behaviors in childhood and adolescent autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). In total, 45 child or adolescent patients with ASD were randomized into two acute 8-week phases in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study of liquid fluoxetine. Study design included two randomized 8-week fluoxetine and placebo phases separated by a 4-week washout phase. Outcome measures included measures of repetitive behaviors and global improvement. Low-dose liquid fluoxetine (mean final dose: 9.9+/-4.35 mg/day) was superior to placebo in the treatment of repetitive behaviors by CY-BOCS compulsion scale. The effect size was in the moderate to large range, and the doses used were low. Liquid fluoxetine was only slightly, and not significantly, superior to placebo on CGI autism score partially due to a phase order effect. However, fluoxetine was marginally superior to placebo on a composite measure of global effectiveness. Liquid fluoxetine did not significantly differ from placebo on treatment emergent side effects. Liquid fluoxetine in low doses is more effective than placebo in the treatment of repetitive behaviors in childhood autism. Limitations include small sample size and the crossover design of the study. Further replication and long-term maintenance trials are needed.","Hollander Eric, Phillips Ann, Chaplin William, Zagursky Karen, Novotny Sherie, Wasserman Stacey, Iyengar Rupa",Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,"Administration, Oral, Adolescent, Autistic Disorder, Child, Cross-Over Studies, Cumulative Trauma Disorders, Female, Fluoxetine, Humans, Male, Placebos, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15602505,"Seaver and New York Autism Center of Excellence, New York, NY 10029, USA. eric.hollander@mssm.edu",10.1038/Sj.Npp.1300627,Yes,Yes (cherry),Fluoxetine,"Hollander, Eric",2005,Neuropsychopharmacology,RPCT - Crossover,16 weeks ,45,,5-16 y,mean final dose: 9.9 mg/d (SD: 4.5 mg),repetitve behaviors and global improvement,CY-BOCS and CGI-AD composite scores,Combined CY-BOCS and CGI-AD scores lead to a trend in a reduction of ASD severity.,global improvement,CGIS-AS,No improvement in CGIS-AS. ,No difference in AE severity or incidence in fluoxetine and placebo groups.

63,23233021,A randomised controlled trial of bumetanide in the treatment of autism in children.,12/11/2012,"Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated synapses and the oscillations they orchestrate are altered in autism. GABA-acting benzodiazepines exert in some patients with autism paradoxical effects, raising the possibility that like in epilepsies, GABA excites neurons because of elevated intracellular concentrations of chloride. Following a successful pilot study,(1) we have now performed a double-blind clinical trial using the diuretic, chloride-importer antagonist bumetanide that reduces intracellular chloride reinforcing GABAergic inhibition. Sixty children with autism or Asperger syndrome (3-11 years old) received for 3 months placebo or bumetanide (1 mg daily), followed by 1-month wash out. Determination of the severity of autism was made with video films at day 0 (D0) and D90 by blind, independent evaluators. Bumetanide reduced significantly the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) (D90-D0; P<0.004 treated vs placebo), Clinical Global Impressions (P<0.017 treated vs placebo) and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule values when the most severe cases (CARS values above the mean Â± s.d.; n=9) were removed (Wilcoxon test: P-value=0.031; Student's t-test: P-value=0.017). Side effects were restricted to an occasional mild hypokalaemia (3.0-3.5 mM l(-1) K(+)) that was treated with supplemental potassium. In a companion study, chronic bumetanide treatment significantly improved accuracy in facial emotional labelling, and increased brain activation in areas involved in social and emotional perception (Hadjikhani et al., submitted). Therefore, bumetanide is a promising novel therapeutic agent to treat autism. Larger trials are warranted to better determine the population best suited for this treatment.","Lemonnier E, Degrez C, Phelep M, Tyzio R, Josse F, Grandgeorge M, Hadjikhani N, Ben-Ari Y",Translational psychiatry,"Asperger Syndrome, Autistic Disorder, Bumetanide, Child, Child, Preschool, Double-Blind Method, Female, GABA Modulators, Humans, Male, Severity of Illness Index, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23233021,"Centre de Ressources Autisme de Bretagne, CHRU Brest HÃ´pital Bohars, Route de Ploudalmezeau, Bohars, France. eric.lemonnier@chu-brest.fr",10.1038/Tp.2012.124,Yes,No,Bumetanide,"Lemonnier, E",11-Dec-12,Translational Psychiatry ,Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled  ,"4 months (3 month treatment, 1 month washout)",60,89% M; 11% F,3-11 y,0.5 mg BID,ASD Severity,CARS scores,"The group treated with Bumetanide had a significately lower score on the CARS test at endpoint, when removing the most severe cases of ASD in this group.

64,25313065,Sulforaphane treatment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).,10/28/2014,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), characterized by both impaired communication and social interaction, and by stereotypic behavior, affects about 1 in 68, predominantly males. The medico-economic burdens of ASD are enormous, and no recognized treatment targets the core features of ASD. In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial, young men (aged 13-27) with moderate to severe ASD received the phytochemical sulforaphane (n = 29)--derived from broccoli sprout extracts--or indistinguishable placebo (n = 15). The effects on behavior of daily oral doses of sulforaphane (50-150 Âµmol) for 18 wk, followed by 4 wk without treatment, were quantified by three widely accepted behavioral measures completed by parents/caregivers and physicians: the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), and Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale (CGI-I). Initial scores for ABC and SRS were closely matched for participants assigned to placebo and sulforaphane. After 18 wk, participants receiving placebo experienced minimal change (<3.3%), whereas those receiving sulforaphane showed substantial declines (improvement of behavior): 34% for ABC (P < 0.001, comparing treatments) and 17% for SRS scores (P = 0.017). On CGI-I, a significantly greater number of participants receiving sulforaphane had improvement in social interaction, abnormal behavior, and verbal communication (P = 0.015-0.007). Upon discontinuation of sulforaphane, total scores on all scales rose toward pretreatment levels. Dietary sulforaphane, of recognized low toxicity, was selected for its capacity to reverse abnormalities that have been associated with ASD, including oxidative stress and lower antioxidant capacity, depressed glutathione synthesis, reduced mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation, increased lipid peroxidation, and neuroinflammmation.","Singh Kanwaljit, Connors Susan L, Macklin Eric A, Smith Kirby D, Fahey Jed W, Talalay Paul, Zimmerman Andrew W",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"Adolescent, Adult, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Humans, Isothiocyanates, Male, Placebos, Social Behavior, Sulfoxides, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25313065,"Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Lewis B. and Dorothy Cullman Chemoprotection Center, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205.; McKusick-Nathans Institute for Genetic Medicine and.; Lurie Center for Autism, Department of Pediatrics, Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, Harvard Medical School, Lexington, MA 02421; Department of Pediatrics (Neurology), University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01655; ptalalay@jhmi.edu Andrew.Zimmerman@umassmemorial.org.; Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Lewis B. and Dorothy Cullman Chemoprotection Center, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205 ptalalay@jhmi.edu Andrew.Zimmerman@umassmemorial.org.; Lurie Center for Autism, Department of Pediatrics, Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, Harvard Medical School, Lexington, MA 02421; Department of Pediatrics (Neurology), University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01655;; Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital Biostatistics Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114; and.; Lurie Center for Autism, Department of Pediatrics, Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, Harvard Medical School, Lexington, MA 02421;",10.1073/Pnas.1416940111,,,Sulforaphane ,"Singh, Kanwaljit",28-Oct-14,PNAS,Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled  ,27 weeks total (4 wk washout),44,100% M,13-27 y; Mean: 17 y,50-150 umol,Social behaviors. ,"Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Social Reponsiveness Scale (SRS), and Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale (CGI-I)",Substantial improvements in ABC and SRS scores in the sulforaphane treatment group. ,,,,Well tolerated with limited side effects. ,"""Favorable safety profile"" and ""recognized low toxicity""",n=3,39 White; 2 Black; 1 Hispanic; 2 Asian,"Limitations: the study only tested males who were primarily caucasian.

65,28696286,Intranasal oxytocin treatment for social deficits and biomarkers of response in children with autism.,7/25/2017,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by core social deficits. Prognosis is poor, in part, because existing medications target only associated ASD features. Emerging evidence suggests that the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) may be a blood-based biomarker of social functioning and a possible treatment for ASD. However, prior OXT treatment trials have produced equivocal results, perhaps because of variability in patients' underlying neuropeptide biology, but this hypothesis has not been tested. Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design, we tested the efficacy and tolerability of 4-wk intranasal OXT treatment (24 International Units, twice daily) in 32 children with ASD, aged 6-12 y. When pretreatment neuropeptide measures were included in the statistical model, OXT compared with placebo treatment significantly enhanced social abilities in children with ASD [as measured by the trial's primary outcome measure, the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS)]. Importantly, pretreatment blood OXT concentrations also predicted treatment response, such that individuals with the lowest pretreatment OXT concentrations showed the greatest social improvement. OXT was well tolerated, and its effects were specific to social functioning, with no observed decrease in repetitive behaviors or anxiety. Finally, as with many trials, some placebo-treated participants showed improvement on the SRS. This enhanced social functioning was mirrored by a posttreatment increase in their blood OXT concentrations, suggesting that increased endogenous OXT secretion may underlie this improvement. These findings indicate that OXT treatment enhances social abilities in children with ASD and that individuals with pretreatment OXT signaling deficits may stand to benefit the most from OXT treatment.","Parker Karen J, Oztan Ozge, Libove Robin A, Sumiyoshi Raena D, Jackson Lisa P, Karhson Debra S, Summers Jacqueline E, Hinman Kyle E, Motonaga Kara S, Phillips Jennifer M, Carson Dean S, Garner Joseph P, Hardan Antonio Y",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"Administration, Inhalation, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Female, Humans, Male, Oxytocics, Oxytocin, Social Skills",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28696286,"Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305; kjparker@stanford.edu.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.",10.1073/Pnas.1705521114,,,Intranasal Oxytocin,"Parker, Karen",25-Jul-17,PNAS,RPCT - Parallel design,4 weeks,32,27 M: 5 F,"6-12 years, Mean: 8/9 years",24 IU BID,Social behaviors. ,Improvement in social abilities measured by the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS).,"Oxytocin significantly enhanced social abilities in participants.

66,16190799,"A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of valproate for aggression in youth with pervasive developmental disorders.",8/1/2005,"The aim of this study was to study valproate efficacy and safety for aggression in children and adolescents with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD). In this prospective double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 30 subjects (20 boys, 10 girls) 6-20 years of age with PDD and significant aggression were randomized and received treatment with valproate (VPA) or placebo (PBO) for 8 weeks as outpatients. Mean VPA trough blood levels were 75.5 mcg/mL at week 4 and 77.8 mcg/mL at week 8. No treatment difference was observed statistically between VPA and PBO groups. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist--Community Scale (ABC-C) Irritability subscale was the primary outcome measure (p = 0.65), and CGI--Improvement (p = 0.16) and OAS (p = 0.96) were secondary outcome measures. Increased appetite and skin rash were significant side effects. Only 1 subject was dropped from the study owing to side effects, notably a spreading skin rash, which then resolved spontaneously. Two subjects receiving VPA developed increased serum ammonia levels, one with an associated parent report of slurred speech and mild cognitive slowing. Poststudy, of 16 VPA and PBO subjects receiving VPA, 10 subjects demonstrated sustained response, 4 of whom later attempted taper, with significant relapse of aggression. The present negative findings cannot be viewed as conclusive, partly owing to the large placebo response, subject heterogeneity, and size of the groups. Larger studies are needed to expand upon these findings.","Hellings Jessica A, Weckbaugh Marilyn, Nickel Elizabeth J, Cain Sharon E, Zarcone Jennifer R, Reese R Matthew, Hall Sandra, Ermer David J,

67,17069543,A double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study of olanzapine in childhood/adolescent pervasive developmental disorder.,10/1/2006,"Atypical antipsychotics have been shown to improve disruptive and repetitive behaviors in pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs), but they require assessment of potential side effects. This is the first placebo-controlled trial of olanzapine in the treatment of children and adolescents with PDD. Eleven patients with a diagnosis of either autism, Asperger's syndrome, or PDD not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) and aged 6-14 years were randomized into an 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel treatment study with olanzapine. There was a significant linear trend x group interaction on the Clinical Global Impressions- Improvement (CGI-I) and 50% on olanzapine versus 20% on placebo were responders. Olanzapine was associated with significant weight gain (7.5 +/- 4.8 lbs vs. 1.5 +/- 1.5 lbs on placebo). Olanzapine may be a promising treatment for improving global functioning of PDDs, but the risk of significant weight gain remains a concern. Additional studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of olanzapine in the treatment of children with PDD.","Hollander Eric, Wasserman Stacey, Swanson Erika N, Chaplin William, Schapiro Melissa L, Zagursky Karen, Novotny Sherie",Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology,"Adolescent, Antipsychotic Agents, Asperger Syndrome, Autistic Disorder, Benzodiazepines, Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Olanzapine, Pilot Projects, Treatment Outcome, Weight Gain",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17069543,"Seaver and NY Autism Center of Excellence, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, One Gustave L.

68,18582177,Cognitive effects of risperidone in children with autism and irritable behavior.,6/1/2008,"The objective of this research was to explore the effects of risperidone on cognitive processes in children with autism and irritable behavior. Thirty-eight children, ages 5-17 years with autism and severe behavioral disturbance, were randomly assigned to risperidone (0.5 to 3.5 mg/day) or placebo for 8 weeks. This sample of 38 was a subset of 101 subjects who participated in the clinical trial; 63 were unable to perform the cognitive tasks. A double-blind placebo-controlled parallel groups design was used. Dependent measures included tests of sustained attention, verbal learning, hand-eye coordination, and spatial memory assessed before, during, and after the 8-week treatment. Changes in performance were compared by repeated measures ANOVA. Twenty-nine boys and 9 girls with autism and severe behavioral disturbance and a mental age >or=18 months completed the cognitive part of the study. No decline in performance occurred with risperidone. Performance on a cancellation task (number of correct detections) and a verbal learning task (word recognition) was better on risperidone than on placebo (without correction for multiplicity). Equivocal improvement also occurred on a spatial memory task. There were no significant differences between treatment conditions on the Purdue Pegboard (hand-eye coordination) task or the Analog Classroom Task (timed math test). Risperidone given to children with autism at doses up to 3.5 mg for up to 8 weeks appears to have no detrimental effect on cognitive performance.","Aman Michael G, Hollway Jill A, McDougle Christopher J, Scahill Lawrence, Tierney Elaine, McCracken James T, Arnold L Eugene, Vitiello Benedetto, Ritz Louise, Gavaletz Allison, Cronin Pegeen, Swiezy Naomi, Wheeler Courtney, Koenig Kathleen, Ghuman Jaswinder K, Posey David J",Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology,"Adolescent, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child Behavior Disorders, Child, Preschool, Cognition, Cognition Disorders, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Irritable Mood, Male, Psychomotor Performance, Risperidone",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18582177,"Nisonger Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.",10.1089/Cap.2007.0133,Yes,yes,Risperidone,"Aman, Michael",2008,Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology,Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled ,8 weeks,38,9 F: 29 M,5-18 y,0.5-3.5 mg/d,Cognition,Sustained attention; hand-eye coordination; verbal learning; and spatial memory.

69,22537359,Placebo-controlled pilot trial of mecamylamine for treatment of autism spectrum disorders.,6/1/2012,"To explore possible benefits of a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agent for autistic symptoms based on postmortem observation of nAChR abnormalities (deficient Î±4Î²2 nAChRs, excess Î±7 nAChRs) in brains of patients with autism. Mecamylamine, because of its safety record in children with other disorders, was chosen for this first exploration. Twenty children with autism spectrum disorder age 4-12 years were randomly assigned for 14 weeks to placebo (n=8) or mecamylamine (n=12) in ascending fixed doses: 0.5 mg/day for 6 weeks, 2.5 mg for 2 weeks, then 5 mg/day for 6 weeks. Improvement was rated by a blinded independent evaluator. Because of small sample, data analysis was descriptive. Eighteen participants (10 mecamylamine, 8 placebo) completed the study. All doses were well tolerated; the only side effect of note was constipation (50% compared with 25% of placebo group). Three children had clinically nonsignificant electrocardiographic QT prolongation. Both groups showed modest to moderate improvement, but differences between groups were negligible. On the primary outcome measure, the Ohio Autism Clinical Impressions Scale, 90% of the active treatment group showed improvement at some point (but only 40% sustained it), compared with 62% on placebo. Of the four in active treatment that sustained improvement, three had a maximum dose of 0.13-0.15 mg/kg/day, while those who regressed had doses â¥0.18 mg/kg/day. Graphed means suggested better outcome with lower mg/kg and longer medication duration. Four parents spontaneously reported reduced hyperactivity and irritability and better verbalization and continued mecamylamine at their own expense. Mecamylamine appeared to be safe, but not very effective in autism. The suggestion of better results at lower doses and longer exposure warrants consideration for future trials. The next step would be exploration of a more specific Î±4Î²2 nAChR agonist, such as varenicline.","Arnold L Eugene, Aman Michael G, Hollway Jill, Hurt Elizabeth, Bates Bethany, Li Xiaobai, Farmer Cristan, Anand Rene, Thompson Susan, Ramadan Yaser, Williams Craig",Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology,"Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Child, Preschool, Constipation, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Double-Blind Method, Female, Ganglionic Blockers, Humans, Male, Mecamylamine, Pilot Projects, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22537359,"Nisonger Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. l.arnold@osumc.edu",10.1089/Cap.2011.0056,,,Mecamylamine,"Arnold, Eugene",2012,Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology,Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled  - Pilot,14 weeks,20,17 M: 3 F,4-12 y; Mean: 7.4 y (SD: 2.55),"0.5 mg/d for 6 weeks - 2.5 mg for 2 weeks - then, 5 mg/d for 6 weeks.",,Ohio Autism Clinical Impressions Scale (OACIS) and OARS-4 ,"90% of the treatment group showed improvement, but only 40% sustained it.

70,23782128,Effects of extended release methylphenidate treatment on ratings of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and associated behavior in children with autism spectrum disorders and ADHD symptoms.,6/1/2013,"The purpose of this study was to examine the behavioral effects of four doses of psychostimulant medication, combining extended-release methylphenidate (MPH) in the morning with immediate-release MPH in the afternoon. The sample comprised 24 children (19 boys; 5 girls) who met American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed. (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) on the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), and had significant symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This sample consisted of elementary school-age, community-based children (mean chronological age=8.8 years, SD=1.7; mean intelligence quotient [IQ]=85; SD=16.8). Effects of four dose levels of MPH on parent and teacher behavioral ratings were investigated using a within-subject, crossover, placebo-controlled design. MPH treatment was associated with significant declines in hyperactive and impulsive behavior at both home and school. Parents noted significant declines in inattentive and oppositional behavior, and improvements in social skills. No exacerbation of stereotypies was noted, and side effects were similar to those seen in typically developing children with ADHD. Dose response was primarily linear in the dose range studied. The results of this study suggest that MPH formulations are efficacious and well-tolerated for children with ASD and significant ADHD symptoms.","Pearson Deborah A, Santos Cynthia W, Aman Michael G, Arnold L Eugene, Casat Charles D, Mansour Rosleen, Lane David M, Loveland Katherine A, Bukstein Oscar G, Jerger Susan W, Factor Perry, Vanwoerden Salome, Perez Evelyn, Cleveland Lynne A",Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology,"Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity, Central Nervous System Stimulants, Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Cross-Over Studies, Delayed-Action Preparations, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Female, Humans, Male, Methylphenidate, Single-Blind Method, Stereotyped Behavior, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23782128,"University of Texas Medical School at Houston, Houston, TX 77054, USA.

In this study, 46 children, 3-7 years of age diagnosed with an ASD were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with 20 mg/kg/day BH4 or placebo for 16 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement and Severity Scales (CGI-I and CGI-S); secondary outcomes were the Preschool Language Scale-4 (PLS-4), Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (Vineland). Overall, no differences were found on global improvement as measured with the CGI-I or CGI-S. Secondary measures indicated significant improvements for BH4 relative to placebo with regard to social awareness, autism mannerisms, hyperactivity, and inappropriate speech. Side effects were minimal and similar between both active medication and placebo. These results indicate that BH4 offers promise in reducing symptoms of ASD.

72,26978327,"Safety and Efficacy of Memantine in Children with Autism: Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Study and Open-Label Extension.",6/1/2017,"Abnormal glutamatergic neurotransmission is implicated in the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this study, the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist memantine (once-daily extended-release [ER]) were investigated in children with autism in a randomized, placebo-controlled, 12 week trial and a 48 week open-label extension. A total of 121 children 6-12 years of age with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed., Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR)-defined autistic disorder were randomized (1:1) to placebo or memantine ER for 12 weeks; 104 children entered the subsequent extension trial. Maximum memantine doses were determined by body weight and ranged from 3 to 15 mg/day. There was one serious adverse event (SAE) (affective disorder, with memantine) in the 12 week study and one SAE (lobar pneumonia) in the 48 week extension; both were deemed unrelated to treatment. Other AEs were considered mild or moderate and most were deemed not related to treatment. No clinically significant changes occurred in clinical laboratory values, vital signs, or electrocardiogram (ECG). There was no significant between-group difference on the primary efficacy outcome of caregiver/parent ratings on the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), although an improvement over baseline at Week 12 was observed in both groups. A trend for improvement at the end of the 48 week extension was observed. No improvements in the active group were observed on any of the secondary end-points, with one communication measure showing significant worsening with memantine compared with placebo (p = 0.02) after 12 weeks. This trial did not demonstrate clinical efficacy of memantine ER in autism; however, the tolerability and safety data were reassuring. Our results could inform future trial design in this population and may facilitate the investigation of memantine ER for other clinical applications.","Aman Michael G, Findling Robert L, Hardan

73,28346865,Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for the Treatment of Executive Function Deficits in Autism Spectrum Disorder: Clinical Trial Approach.,6/1/2017,"Executive function (EF) deficits in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are ubiquitous and understudied. Further, there are no effective, neuroscience-based treatments to address this impairing feature of ASD. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has demonstrated promise in addressing EF deficits in adult neuropsychiatric disorders. This article will outline the design of a novel randomized-controlled trial of bilateral, 20 Hz, rTMS applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for treatment of EF deficits in ASD that is currently ongoing. We describe prior therapeutic rTMS research for ASD and prior rTMS trials targeting EFs in adult neuropsychiatric disorders. A neurophysiological rationale for rTMS treatment of EF deficits in ASD is presented. An ongoing protocol will enroll participants aged 16-35 with ASD and no intellectual disability. Psychotropic medications will be continued during the 4-week trial of active 20 Hz versus sham rTMS applied to the DLPFC. Twenty, active treatment sessions consisting of 25 stimulation trains at a 90% motor threshold will be administered. The primary outcome measure is the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) spatial working memory task. At present, recruitment, enrollment, and treatment within the described clinical trial are ongoing. EF deficits are common and impairing symptoms of ASD. There are no evidence-based treatments for EF deficits in ASD. The protocol described here will provide important preliminary data on the feasibility and efficacy of 20 Hz rTMS to DLPFC for EF deficits in ASD.","Ameis Stephanie H, Daskalakis Zafiris J, Blumberger Daniel M, Desarkar Pushpal, Drmic Irene, Mabbott Donald J, Lai Meng-Chuan, Croarkin Paul E, Szatmari Peter",Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology,"Adolescent, Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Executive Function, Humans, Memory, Short-Term, Neuropsychological Tests, Research Design, Spatial Memory, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28346865,"3 Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto , Toronto, Canada .; 8 Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry and Psychology, Mayo Clinic , Rochester, Minnesota.; 5 Genetics and Genome Biology and Autism Research Unit, The Centre for Applied Genomics, The Hospital for Sick Children , Toronto, Canada .; 1 Centre for Brain and Mental Health, The Hospital for Sick Children , Toronto, Canada .; 6 Program in Neurosciences and Mental Health, Research Institute , The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada .",10.1089/Cap.2016.0146,,,Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS),"Ameis, Stephanie",2017,Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology,Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled  ,4 weeks,40,Not reported. ,16-35 years,20 Hz rTMS applied to dorsolateral prefontal cortex,,Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) spatial working memory task,,,,,No seizures.

74,30132686,Long-Term Efficacy and Safety of Pediatric Prolonged-Release Melatonin for Insomnia in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.,12/1/2018,"<b><i>Objective:</i></b> A recent double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study demonstrated 3-month efficacy and safety of a novel pediatric-appropriate prolonged-release melatonin (PedPRM) for insomnia in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and neurogenetic disorders (NGD) with/without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder comorbidity. Long-term efficacy and safety of PedPRM treatment was studied. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> A prospective, open-label efficacy and safety follow-up of nightly 2, 5, or 10 mg PedPRM in subjects who completed the 13-week double-blind trial (51 PedPRM; 44 placebo). Measures included caregiver-reported Sleep and Nap Diary, Composite Sleep Disturbance Index (CSDI), caregiver's Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and quality of life (WHO-5 Well-Being Index). <b><i>Results:</i></b> Ninety-five subjects (74.7% males; mean [standard deviation] age, 9 [4.24]; range, 2-17.5 years) received PedPRM (2/5 mg) according to the double-blind phase dose, for 39 weeks with optional dose adjustment (2, 5, or 10 mg/day) after the first 13 weeks. After 52 weeks of continuous treatment (PedPRM-randomized group) subjects slept (mean [SE]) 62.08 (21.5) minutes longer (<i>p</i> = 0.007); fell asleep 48.6 (10.2) minutes faster (<i>p</i> < 0.001); had 89.1 (25.5) minutes longer uninterrupted sleep episodes (<i>p</i> = 0.001); 0.41 (0.12) less nightly awakenings (>50% decrease; <i>p</i> = 0.001); and better sleep quality (<i>p</i> < 0.001) compared with baseline. The placebo-randomized group also improved with PedPRM. Altogether, by the end of 39-week follow-up, regardless of randomization assignment, 55/72 (76%) of completers achieved overall improvement of â¥1 hour in total sleep time (TST), sleep latency or both, over baseline, with no evidence of decreased efficacy. In parallel, CSDI child sleep disturbance and caregivers' satisfaction of their child's sleep patterns (<i>p</i> < 0.001 for both), PSQI global (<i>p</i> < 0.001), and WHO-5 (<i>p</i> = 0.001) improved in statistically significant and clinically relevant manner (<i>n</i> = 72) compared with baseline. PedPRM was generally safe; most frequent treatment-related adverse events were fatigue (5.3%) and mood swings (3.2% of patients). <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> PedPRM, an easily swallowed formulation shown to be efficacious versus placebo, is an efficacious and safe option for long-term treatment (up to 52 weeks reported here) of children with ASD and NGD who suffer from insomnia and subsequently improves caregivers' quality of life.","Maras Athanasios, Schroder Carmen M, Malow Beth A, Findling Robert L, Breddy John, Nir Tali, Shahmoon Shiri, Zisapel Nava, Gringras Paul",Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology,"Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Central Nervous System Depressants, Child, Communication Disorders, Comorbidity, Delayed-Action Preparations, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Drug Monitoring, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Melatonin, Polysomnography, Quality of Life, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30132686,"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Kennedy Krieger Institute/Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.; Pharmastat Consulting Ltd., Canterbury, United Kingdom.; Children's Sleep Medicine, Evelina London Children's Hospital, Guy's and St. Thomas', London, United Kingdom.; Strasbourg University Hospital Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Strasbourg, France.; Yulius Academy, Yulius Mental Health Organization, Barendrecht, The Netherlands.; Sleep Division, Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Neurim Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Tel Aviv, Israel.",10.1089/Cap.2018.0020,,,"Melatonin, Prolonged Release ","Schroder, Carmen M.",11-May-19,Journal of Autism & Developmental Disorders,Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled  ,13 weeks,125,92 M: 33 F,2-17.5 y; Mean: 8.7 y (SD: 4.15),2-5 mg,Sleep habits and quality of life.,Strengths and Difficulties Questionaire; Caregiver's quality of life,"Prolonged release melatonin tx resulted in significant improvents in externalizing bx, Caregivers quality of life improved and correlated with the change in total SDQ.",,,,,,n=24 (7 PedPRM),112 white; 9 black or african american; 6 other; 2 Asian,"""PedPRM alleviates insomnia related difficulties, particularly externalizing behavior in the children, subsequently improving caregivers' quality of life.""

75,31478755,Probiotics for Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Quality of Life in Autism: A Placebo-Controlled Pilot Trial.,11/1/2019,"<b><i>Objective:</i></b> A randomized pilot trial of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms targeting probiotic for quality of life in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Thirteen children, 3-12 years of age with ASD, anxiety, and GI symptoms, were randomized into a probiotic crossover trial of 8 weeks each on VISBIOME and placebo separated by a 3-week washout. VISBIOME contains eight probiotic species, mostly <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i>. Primary outcome was the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) GI module. Secondary outcomes included gut microbiota analysis, the Parent-Rated Anxiety Scale for ASD (PRAS-ASD), and parent-selected target symptoms. A mixed analysis model was applied. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Thirteen children were randomized, with 10 completing the study (77% retention): 6 in probiotic/placebo sequence, 4 in placebo/probiotic sequence. Adherence to study treatment was 96%. There were no serious adverse events (AEs), and more nonserious AEs occurred with placebo than with probiotic, including those attributable to treatment. Only 6 of the 10 guessed the correct treatment at the end of week 8. Over the 19-week trial, each outcome improved from baseline and PedsQL correlated significantly with abundance of <i>Lactobacillus</i> without discernable changes to microbiota composition/diversity. Although probiotic showed more improvement than placebo, PedsQL and PRAS-ASD were not statistically significant, as expected at this sample size. PedsQL effect size was <i>d</i> = 0.49 by the general model and <i>d</i> = 0.79 by simple comparison of week 8 changes. A parent-selected target symptom showed significant improvement in GI complaints on probiotic compared with placebo (<i>p</i> = 0.02, <i>d</i> = 0.79). Probiotic effects carried over through the 3-week washout. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> The VISBIOME formulation was safe and suggested a health benefit in children with ASD and GI symptoms who retained <i>Lactobacillus</i>. The moderate effect size compared with placebo warrants a larger trial using a parallel-group design.","Arnold L Eugene, Luna Ruth Ann, Williams Kent, Chan James, Parker Robert A, Wu Qinglong, Hollway

76,34543081,"Neurocognitive Outcomes from Memantine: A Pilot, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.",9/1/2021,"<b><i>Objective:</i></b> Studies interrogating therapeutics which alter the excitation-inhibition balance in the treatment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have reported mixed results on social and behavioral outcomes. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> The aim of this randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled pilot trial was to evaluate neurocognitive effects of memantine over a 24-week trial. Twenty-three children ages 6-12 years old with ASD were randomized to memantine or placebo. Primary outcomes included measures of apraxia and expressive language with evaluations at midpoint (week 12) and endpoint (week 24). Secondary outcomes included memory and adaptive behavior measures. Exploratory outcomes included changes in overall cognitive functioning and behavior (e.g., Aberrant Behavior Checklist). <b><i>Results:</i></b> Results suggest that memantine was well-tolerated. Dropout rates were high across groups with only 14 participants completing the 6-month trial. Memantine was not associated with improvements in apraxia and expressive language. Treatment with memantine was associated with improvements in verbal recognition memory as measured by the Narrative Memory-Recognition (NEPSY-II) (<i>F</i> = 5.05, <i>p</i> = .03). In addition, exploratory analyses of changes in Intelligence quotient (IQ) suggest improvements on verbal IQ (<i>d</i> = 1.8). <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Results suggest future studies of memantine in ASD may benefit from shifting treatment targets from social and behavioral outcomes to exploration of effects of memantine on cognition, potentially as an adjunct to learning and educational interventions.

77,24451919,Inverse Effect of Fluoxetine on Medial Prefrontal Cortex Activation During Reward Reversal in ADHD and Autism.,7/1/2015,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) share brain function abnormalities during cognitive flexibility. Serotonin is involved in both disorders, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can modulate cognitive flexibility and improve behavior in both disorders. Thus, this study investigates shared and disorder-specific brain dysfunctions in these 2 disorders during reward reversal, and the acute effects of an SSRI on these. Age-matched boys with ADHD (15), ASD (18), and controls (21) were compared with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a reversal task. Patients were scanned twice, under either an acute dose of Fluoxetine or placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized design. Repeated-measures analyses within patients assessed drug effects. Patients under each drug condition were compared with controls to assess normalization effects. fMRI data showed that, under placebo, ASD boys underactivated medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), compared with control and ADHD boys. Both patient groups shared decreased precuneus activation. Under Fluoxetine, mPFC activation was up-regulated and normalized in ASD boys relative to controls, but down-regulated in ADHD boys relative to placebo, which was concomitant with worse task performance in ADHD. Fluoxetine therefore has inverse effects on mPFC activation in ASD and ADHD during reversal learning, suggesting dissociated underlying serotonin abnormalities.","Chantiluke Kaylita, Barrett Nadia, Giampietro Vincent, Brammer Michael, Simmons Andrew, Murphy Declan G, Rubia Katya","Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)","Adolescent, Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity, Autistic Disorder, Brain Mapping, Child, Double-Blind Method, Fluoxetine, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Neuropsychological Tests, Prefrontal Cortex, Reversal Learning, Reward, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24451919,"South London and Maudsley NHS Trust.; Department of Forensic and Developmental Sciences, King's College London, London, UK.; Department of Neuroimaging, Institute of Psychiatry.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.; Department of Neuroimaging, Institute of Psychiatry NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health at South London and Maudsley NHS Trust.",10.1093/Cercor/Bht365,Yes,Yes (cherry),Fluoxetine,"Chantiluke, Kaylita",22-Jan-14,Oxford University Press,Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled  , Pts scanned twice after 5 hours after administration.

78,8282676,Naltrexone in autistic children: behavioral symptoms and attentional learning.,11/1/1993,"To assess critically the short-term efficacy and safety of naltrexone in autistic children and its effects on discrimination learning in the laboratory. A parallel group design was employed. After a 2-week placebo baseline period, children were randomly assigned either to naltrexone or to placebo for a period of 3 weeks followed by a one-week posttreatment placebo period. Multiple raters and rating scales were employed in a variety of conditions. Forty-one children, all inpatients, ages 2.9 to 7.8 years, completed the study. Naltrexone reduced hyperactivity and had no effect on discrimination learning in the laboratory. There was a suggestion that it had a beneficial effect on decreasing self-injurious behavior. Untoward effects were mild and transient. In the present study, naltrexone significantly reduced only hyperactivity, and no serious untoward effects were observed. The effectiveness of naltrexone in the treatment of autism and self-injurious behavior requires additional assessment in a sample of children with moderate to severe self-injurious behavior.","Campbell M, Anderson L T, Small A M, Adams P, Gonzalez N M, Ernst M",Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,"Attention, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child,

79,17012983,Levetiracetam versus placebo in childhood and adolescent autism: a double-blind placebo-controlled study.,11/1/2006,"The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of the anticonvulsant levetiracetam in the treatment of children with autism. A previous open-label study in autistic children treated with levetiracetam demonstrated effectiveness in hyperactivity, impulsivity/aggression, and mood lability. Twenty patients with autism ranging from 5 to 17 years of age were entered into a 10-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of levetiracetam versus placebo. The mean maximum dosage for levetiracetam was 862.50+/-279.19 mg/day. We evaluated global improvement of autism with the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) Scale and aggression and affective instability with the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) parent and teacher ratings. We measured repetitive behaviors using the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) score and impulsivity and hyperactivity with the Conners' Rating Scale-Revised: Long Version for parent and teacher. No significant difference was found between levetiracetam and placebo groups comparing the change in CGI-I (t=0.350, d.f.=13.621, P=0.765), nor on change in ABC, CY-BOCS or Conners' scales. These findings suggest that levetiracetam does not improve behavioral disturbances of autism, but are limited by the small sample size and lack of stratification of the autistic sample at baseline.","Wasserman Stacey, Iyengar Rupa, Chaplin William F, Watner Dryden, Waldoks Shulamit E, Anagnostou Evdokia, Soorya Latha, Hollander Eric",International clinical psychopharmacology,"Adolescent, Adolescent Behavior, Anticonvulsants, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child Behavior, Child, Preschool, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Levetiracetam, Male, Piracetam, Placebos, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17012983,"Department of Psychiatry, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA. stacey.wasserman@mssm.edu",10.1097/01.Yic.0000224787.13782.0F,,,Levetiracetam,Wasserman.

80,19797985,"A placebo-controlled, fixed-dose study of aripiprazole in children and adolescents with irritability associated with autistic disorder.",11/1/2009,"To evaluate the short-term efficacy and safety of aripiprazole in the treatment of irritability in children and adolescents with autistic disorder. Two hundred eighteen children and adolescents (aged 6-17 years) with a diagnosis of autistic disorder, and with behaviors such as tantrums, aggression, self-injurious behavior, or a combination of these symptoms, were randomized 1:1:1:1 to aripiprazole (5, 10, or 15 mg/day) or placebo in this 8-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Efficacy was evaluated using the caregiver-rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability subscale (primary efficacy measure) and the clinician-rated Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement score. Safety and tolerability were also assessed. At week 8, all aripiprazole doses produced significantly greater improvement than placebo in mean Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability subscale scores (5 mg/day, -12.4; 10 mg/day, -13.2; 15 mg/day, -14.4; versus placebo, -8.4; all p < .05). All aripiprazole doses demonstrated significantly greater improvements in mean Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement score than placebo at week 8. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were as follows: placebo 7.7%, aripiprazole 5 mg/day 9.4%, 10 mg/day 13.6%, and 15 mg/day 7.4%. The most common adverse event leading to discontinuation was sedation. There were two serious adverse events: presyncope (5 mg/day) and aggression (10 mg/day). At week 8, mean weight change (last observation carried forward) was as follows: placebo +0.3 kg, aripiprazole 5 mg/day +1.3 kg, 10 mg/day +1.3 kg, and 15 mg/day +1.5 kg; all p < .05 versus placebo. Aripiprazole was efficacious and generally safe and well tolerated in the treatment of children and adolescents with irritability associated with autistic disorder.","Marcus Ronald N, Owen Randall, Kamen Lisa, Manos George, McQuade Robert D, Carson William H, Aman Michael G",Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,"Adolescent, Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems, Antipsychotic Agents, Aripiprazole, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child Behavior Disorders, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Double-Blind Method, Drug Administration Schedule, Female, Humans, Irritable Mood, Male, Personality Assessment, Piperazines, Psychomotor Agitation, Quinolones, Self-Injurious Behavior, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19797985,"Drs.

81,32168067,"Prednisolone as Adjunctive Treatment to Risperidone in Children With Regressive Type of Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial.",1/1/2020,"This study aimed to evaluate efficacy and safety of prednisolone as an adjunctive treatment to risperidone, in children with regressive autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The current 12-week, randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled trial recruited 37 patients with regressive ASD. The participants were allocated to receive either 1 mg/kg per day prednisolone or matched placebo in addition to risperidone. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Edition (ABC-C) scale and Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) were used to measure behavioral outcomes at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12 of the study course. The primary outcome was the change in ABC-irritability subscale score, whereas the secondary outcomes were the change in scores of other ABC-C subscales, in CARS score, and in the level of inflammatory biomarkers. Twenty-six patients completed the 12 weeks of study period. Repeated-measures analysis demonstrated significant effect for time-treatment interaction in the CARS (F (1, 2.23) = 13.22, P < 0.001), as well as 4 subscales of the ABC-C including: irritability (F (1, 2.12) = 3.84, P = 0.026), hyperactivity (F (1, 2.09) = 3.56, P = 0.039), lethargy (F (1, 2.18) = 31.50, P < 0.001), and stereotypy (F (1, 1.89) = 4.04, P = 0.026). However, no significant time-treatment interaction was identified for inappropriate speech subscale (F (1, 2.03) = 1.71, P = 0.191). In addition, inflammatory biomarkers were significantly decreased after 3 months of prednisolone add-on. No significant adverse event was detected during the trial. Prednisolone, as an add-on to risperidone, could remarkably improve core features in children with regressive ASD.","Malek Malekfarhad, Ashraf-Ganjouei Amir, Moradi Kamyar, Bagheri Sayna, Mohammadi

82,29430839,"Effects of l-Carnosine Supplementation on Sleep Disorders and Disease Severity in Autistic Children: A Randomized, Controlled Clinical Trial.",7/1/2018,"Sleep disorders are frequently reported in autistic patients. Evidences suggest that increased oxidative stress and reduced antioxidants may play a major role in the pathogenesis of these disorders. Carnosine acts as an antioxidant, antitoxic and neuroprotective agent. The aim of this trial study was to examine the effects of carnosine supplementation on the sleep disorders and severity of autism core symptoms in autistic patients. In this double-blind, randomized clinical trial, 43 autistic patients (31 boys and 12 girls; aged 4 to 16 years) were divided into two groups of carnosine and control that received 500 mg of carnosine and 500 mg of placebo per day for 2 months, respectively. Sleep disorders were measured using Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaires. Gilliam Autism Rating Scale 2 was used to assess the effects of carnosine supplementation on the autism severity. Carnosine supplementation did not change anthropometric indices (p > 0.05) and showed no effect on autism severity (p > 0.05), whereas it significantly reduced sleep duration (p = 0.04), parasomnias (p = 0.02) and total sleep disorders score by 7.59% (p = 0.006) when compared with the control group.

83,31714621,Resveratrol as adjunctive therapy in treatment of irritability in children with autism: A double-blind and placebo-controlled randomized trial.,4/1/2020,"The underlying pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been linked to immune dysregulation, oxidative stress and excitation-inhibition imbalance. Among associated symptoms of ASD, management of irritability has gained considerable attention as it complicates adjustment of ASD patients and thus necessitates its pharmacological treatment. Resveratrol is a plant phytoalexin, which has been demonstrated to have neuroprotective effects through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial was designed to assess the potential therapeutic effects of resveratrol plus risperidone on irritability of ASD patients. Sixty-two patients were assigned randomly into two groups of resveratrol and placebo. Both groups were treated with risperidone twice daily starting at a dose of 0.5 mg with a dose increase of 0.5 mg per week (for the first 3 weeks). Resveratrol dosage was 250 mg twice per day from the beginning of the study. Using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C), patients were assessed for ASD-related behavioural symptoms at baseline, week 5 and week 10. The frequency of adverse events was recorded using a checklist containing 25 possible side effects, including general, gastrointestinal, neurological and cardiovascular complications. Improvements in primary outcome measure (irritability) and three secondary outcome measures (lethargy/social withdrawal, stereotypic behaviour and inappropriate speech subscales) in the resveratrol group were statistically similar to those in the placebo group. The repeated measures analysis showed no time Ã treatment interaction on these subscale scores. In contrast, patients in the resveratrol group showed greater decline in hyperactivity/non-compliance score as a secondary outcome measure (mean difference [CI = 95%] = 4.51 [0.10-8.92], t = 2.04; P = .04), and repeated measures analysis showed significant effect for time Ã treatment effect on this subscale score (F = 3.81; df = 1.30; P = .043). There was no significant difference in number and severity of adverse events between the two groups. This clinical trial demonstrated no significant effect for adjunctive treatment with resveratrol on irritability of patients with ASD. However, it provided preliminary evidence indicating that resveratrol could improve hyperactivity/non-compliance of ASD patients.","Hendouei Fatemeh, Sanjari Moghaddam Hossein, Mohammadi Mohammad Reza, Taslimi Negin, Rezaei Farzin, Akhondzadeh Shahin",Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,"Antipsychotic Agents, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Double-Blind Method, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Humans, Irritable Mood, Male, Neuroprotective Agents, Resveratrol, Risperidone, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31714621,"Qods Hospital, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran.; Psychiatric Research Center, Roozbeh Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.",10.1111/Jcpt.13076,yes both,Yes (risperidone),Resveratrol + risperidone,"Hendouei, Fatemeh",2020,Journal of Clinical Pharmacy and Therapeutics,Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled ,10 weeks,62,50 M: 12 F,mean (resveratrol): 7.8 y (SD:2.1); mean (placebo): 8.1 y (SD: 1.9),"risperidone: and resveratrol: 250 mg BID, or plus placebo",Irritability,ABC irritability,No time x treatment differences in resveratrol and placebo groups. ,"Hyperactivity/non-compliance, lethargy/social withdrawal, stereotypy, and inappropriate speech",ABC-C (all subscales),"Significant time x treatment effect on hyperactivity/non-compliance for the resveratrol group compared to placebo.

84,22993294,"Effects of STX209 (arbaclofen) on neurobehavioral function in children and adults with fragile X syndrome: a randomized, controlled, phase 2 trial.",9/19/2012,"Research on animal models of fragile X syndrome suggests that STX209, a Î³-aminobutyric acid type B (GABA(B)) agonist, might improve neurobehavioral function in affected patients. We evaluated whether STX209 improves behavioral symptoms of fragile X syndrome in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in 63 subjects (55 male), ages 6 to 39 years, with a full mutation in the FMR1 gene (>200 CGG triplet repeats). We found no difference from placebo on the primary endpoint, the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability (ABC-I) subscale. In the other analyses specified in the protocol, improvement was seen on the visual analog scale ratings of parent-nominated problem behaviors, with positive trends on multiple global measures. Post hoc analysis with the ABC-Social Avoidance scale, a newly validated scale for the assessment of fragile X syndrome, showed a significant beneficial treatment effect in the full study population. A post hoc subgroup of 27 subjects with more severe social impairment showed improvements on the Vineland II-Socialization raw score, on the ABC-Social Avoidance scale, and on all global measures. STX209 was well tolerated, with 8% incidences of sedation and of headache as the most frequent side effects. In this exploratory study, STX209 did not show a benefit on irritability in fragile X syndrome. Nonetheless, our results suggest that GABA(B) agonists have potential to improve social function and behavior in patients with fragile X syndrome.","Berry-Kravis Elizabeth M, Hessl David, Rathmell Barbara, Zarevics Peter, Cherubini Maryann, Walton-Bowen Karen, Mu Yi, Nguyen Danh V, Gonzalez-Heydrich Joseph, Wang Paul P, Carpenter Randall L, Bear Mark F, Hagerman Randi J",Science translational medicine,"Adolescent, Adult, Baclofen, Behavior, Child, Female, Fragile X Syndrome, Humans, Male, Nervous System, Neuropsychological Tests, Reproducibility of Results, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22993294,"Department of Pediatrics, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.",10.1126/Scitranslmed.3004214,Yes,No,Arbaclofen (STX209),"Berry-Kravis, EM",2012,Science Translational Medicine,Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled  - Pilot,15 months,63,55 M: 8 F,6-39 y,"max: 10 mg BID for children, 10 mg 3x/d for adults",Irritability in fragile x syndrome (FXS),ABC-irritability,No significant improvement in ABC scores with treatment. ,Neurobehavioral function in FXS,"CGIS, ABC, VABS, SRS, Repetitive Behavior Scale-revised, Child and Adolescent Symptom inventory Anxiety scale, ADHD Rating Scale-IV, VAS, vocabulary and short term/working memory",VAS problem behavior rating scores were better during arbaclofen treatment.

85,31043522,A randomized placebo-controlled pilot trial shows that intranasal vasopressin improves social deficits in children with autism.,5/8/2019,"The social impairments of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have a major impact on quality of life, yet there are no medications that effectively treat these core social behavior deficits. Preclinical research suggests that arginine vasopressin (AVP), a neuropeptide involved in promoting mammalian social behaviors, may be a possible treatment for ASD. Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel study design, we tested the efficacy and tolerability of a 4-week intranasal AVP daily treatment in 30 children with ASD. AVP-treated participants aged 6 to 9.5 years received the maximum daily target dose of 24 International Units (IU); participants aged 9.6 to 12.9 years received the maximum daily target dose of 32 IU. Intranasal AVP treatment compared to placebo enhanced social abilities as assessed by change from baseline in this phase 2 trial's primary outcome measure, the Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd Edition total score (SRS-2 <i>T</i> score; <i>F</i> <sub>1,20</sub> = 9.853; <i>P</i> = 0.0052; Î·<sub>p</sub> <sup>2</sup> = 33.0%; Cohen's <i>d</i> = 1.40). AVP treatment also diminished anxiety symptoms and some repetitive behaviors. Most of these findings were more pronounced when we accounted for pretreatment AVP concentrations in blood. AVP was well tolerated with minimal side effects. No AVP-treated participants dropped out of the trial, and there were no differences in the rate of adverse events reported between treatment conditions. Last, no changes from baseline were observed in vital signs, electrocardiogram tracings, height and body weight, or clinical chemistry measurements after 4 weeks of AVP treatment. These preliminary findings suggest that AVP has potential for treating social impairments in children with ASD.","Parker Karen J, Oztan Ozge, Libove Robin A, Mohsin Noreen, Karhson Debra S, Sumiyoshi Raena D, Summers Jacqueline E, Hinman Kyle E, Motonaga Kara S, Phillips Jennifer M, Carson Dean S, Fung Lawrence K, Garner Joseph P, Hardan Antonio Y",Science translational medicine,"Administration, Intranasal, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Female, Humans, Male, Pilot Projects, Placebos, Social Behavior, Treatment Outcome, Vasopressins",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31043522,"Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. kjparker@stanford.edu.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.",10.1126/Scitranslmed.Aau7356,,,Vasopressin (intranasal),"Parker, Karen",May-19,Science Translational Medicine,RCT,4 weeks,30,25 M: 25 F,6-12 y (mean: 9.14-9.86 y),6-9.5 y: max: 12 IU BID; 9.6-12.9 y: 16 IU BID,Social abilities,"SRS-2, SCI, RRB",The AVP treatment group showed greater improvement in social abilities as shown by scores on SRS-2 and CGI-I scores.

86,25530675,Effect of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation on autism: a randomized double-blind crossover trial.,1/1/2014,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC), and Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) after anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in individuals with autism. Twenty patients with autism received 5 consecutive days of both sham and active tDCS stimulation (1 mA) in a randomized double-blind crossover trial over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (F3) for 20 minutes in different orders. Measures of CARS, ATEC, and CGAS were administered before treatment and at 7 days posttreatment. The result showed statistical decrease in CARS score (P < 0.001). ATEC total was decreased from 67.25 to 58 (P < 0.001). CGAS was increased at 7 days posttreatment (P = 0.042). Our study suggests that anodal tDCS over the F3 may be a useful clinical tool in autism.","Amatachaya Anuwat, Auvichayapat Narong, Patjanasoontorn Niramol, Suphakunpinyo Chanyut, Ngernyam Niran, Aree-Uea Benchaporn, Keeratitanont Keattichai, Auvichayapat Paradee",Behavioural neurology,"Autistic Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Humans, Male, Prefrontal Cortex, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25530675,"Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen 40002, Thailand.; Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen 40002, Thailand.; Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen 40002, Thailand.",10.1155/2014/173073,,,Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS),"Amatachaya, Anuwat",Oct-14,Behavioural Neurology,Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled ,"8 weeks total (5 consecutive days tDCS, 1 week assessment, 4-week washout, 5 consecutive days days of tDCS)",20,100% M,5-8 y,"1mA anodal tDCS targeting left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), or sham (placebo) tDCS",,"CARS, ATEC, CGAS, CGI-I","Greater pre to posttreatment decrease in CARS score that was maintained for 7 days post treatment (end of trial).

87,34257640,Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) over the Left Dorsal Lateral Prefrontal Cortex in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).,1/1/2021,"Recently, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been applied to relieve symptoms in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this prospective, parallel, single-blinded, randomized study, we investigate the modulation effect of three-week tDCS treatment at the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in children with ASD. 47 children with ASD were enrolled, and 40 (20 in each group) completed the study. The primary outcomes are Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), and the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R). We found that children with ASD can tolerate three-week tDCS treatment with no serious adverse events detected. A within-group comparison showed that real tDCS, but not sham tDCS, can significantly reduce the scores of CARS, Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ), and general impressions in CARS (15th item). Real tDCS produced significant score reduction in the CSHQ and in CARS general impressions when compared to the effects of sham tDCS. The pilot study suggests that three-week left DLPFC tDCS is well-tolerated and may hold potential in relieving some symptoms in children with ASD.","Qiu Jiujun, Kong Xuejun, Li Jihan, Yang Jie, Huang

88,22193531,A double-blind placebo-controlled trial of fluoxetine for repetitive behaviors and global severity in adult autism spectrum disorders.,3/1/2012,"The effects of fluoxetine and placebo on repetitive behaviors and global severity were compared in adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Adults with ASDs were enrolled in a 12-week double-blind placebo-controlled fluoxetine trial. Thirty-seven were randomly assigned to fluoxetine (N=22) or placebo (N=15). Dosage followed a fixed schedule, starting at 10 mg/day and increasing as tolerated up to 80 mg/day. Repetitive behaviors were measured with the compulsion subscale of the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale; the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) improvement scale was used to rate improvement in obsessive-compulsive symptoms and overall severity. There was a significant treatment-by-time interaction indicating a significantly greater reduction in repetitive behaviors across time for fluoxetine than for placebo. With overall response defined as a CGI global improvement score of 2 or less, there were significantly more responders at week 12 in the fluoxetine group than in the placebo group. The risk ratio was 1.5 for CGI global improvement (responders: fluoxetine, 35%; placebo, 0%) and 1.8 for CGI-rated improvement in obsessive-compulsive symptoms (responders: fluoxetine, 50%; placebo, 8%). Only mild and moderate side effects were observed. Fluoxetine treatment, compared to placebo, resulted in significantly greater improvement in repetitive behaviors, according to both the Yale-Brown compulsion subscale and CGI rating of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, as well as on the CGI overall improvement rating. Fluoxetine appeared to be well tolerated. These findings stand in contrast to findings in a trial of citalopram for childhood autism.","Hollander Eric, Soorya Latha, Chaplin William, Anagnostou Evdokia, Taylor Bonnie P, Ferretti Casara J, Wasserman Stacey, Swanson Erika, Settipani Cara",The American journal of psychiatry,"Adolescent, Adult, Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Double-Blind Method, Female, Fluoxetine, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Obsessive Behavior, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, Severity of Illness Index, Stereotypic Movement Disorder, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22193531,"Autism and Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum Program, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, USA. eholland@montefiore.org",10.1176/Appi.Ajp.2011.10050764,Yes,Yes (cherry),Fluoxetine,"Hollander, Eric",Mar-12,The American Journal of Psychiatry  ,Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled ,12 weeks,37,26 M: 11 F,"18-60 y, Mean: 34 y",20-80 mg/d; mean: 64.76 mg/d,Repetitive behaviors.,Yale Brown Obessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS); CGI improvement for repetitive behaviors,Fluoxetine resulted in 'significantly greater improvements in repetitive behaviors'. ,"Global severity, irritability, depression",ABC irritability; Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D); CGI improvement of overall symptoms,ABC irritability score changes were not significant.

89,26315981,Extended-Release Guanfacine for Hyperactivity in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder.,12/1/2015,"Hyperactivity, impulsiveness, and distractibility are common problems in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Extended-release guanfacine is approved for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder but not well studied in ASD. In a multisite, randomized clinical trial, extended-release guanfacine was compared with placebo in children with ASD accompanied by hyperactivity, impulsiveness, and distractibility. Sixty-two subjects (boys, N=53; girls, N=9; mean age=8.5 years [SD=2.25]) were randomly assigned to guanfacine (N=30) or placebo (N=32) for 8 weeks. The guanfacine group showed a 43.6% decline in scores on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-hyperactivity subscale (least squares mean from 34.2 to 19.3) compared with a 13.2% decrease in the placebo group (least squares mean from 34.2 to 29.7; effect size=1.67). The rate of positive response (much improved or very much improved on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale) was 50% (15 of 30) for guanfacine compared with 9.4% (3 of 32) for placebo. A brief cognitive battery tapping working memory and motor planning showed no group differences before or after 8 weeks of treatment. The modal dose of guanfacine at week 8 was 3 mg/day (range: 1-4 mg/day), and the modal dose was 3 mg/day (range: 2-4 mg/day) for placebo. Four guanfacine-treated subjects (13.3%) and four placebo subjects (12.5%) exited the study before week 8. The most common adverse events included drowsiness, fatigue, and decreased appetite. There were no significant changes on ECG in either group. For subjects in the guanfacine group, blood pressure declined in the first 4 weeks, with return nearly to baseline by endpoint (week 8). Pulse rate showed a similar pattern but remained lower than baseline at endpoint. Extended-release guanfacine appears to be safe and effective for reducing hyperactivity, impulsiveness, and distractibility in children with ASD.","Scahill Lawrence, McCracken James T, King Bryan H, Rockhill Carol, Shah Bhavik, Politte Laura, Sanders Roy, Minjarez Mendy, Cowen Jennifer, Mullett Jennifer, Page Chris, Ward Denise, Deng Yanhong, Loo Sandra, Dziura James, McDougle Christopher J,",The American journal of psychiatry,"Adolescent, Adrenergic alpha-2 Receptor Agonists, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Delayed-Action Preparations, Double-Blind Method, Female, Guanfacine, Humans, Hyperkinesis, Male, Memory, Short-Term, Neuropsychological Tests, Psychomotor Performance, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26315981,"From the Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta; the Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, University of California, Los Angeles; the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Wash.; the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Lurie Center for Autism, Massachusetts General Hospital, Lexington, Mass.; the Marcus Autism Center, Atlanta; the Department of Biostatistics, Yale University, New Haven, Conn.; the Department of Emergency Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, Conn.; the Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston; and the David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles.",10.1176/Appi.Ajp.2015.15010055,No,No,Guanfacine (ER),"Scahill, Lawrence",28-Aug-15,The American Journal of Psychiatry  ,RCT - multisite,16 Weeks,62,9 F: 53 M,5-14 y; Mean: 8.5 y,1-4 mg/d; mean: 3 mg/d,Hyperactivity,.

90,8369641,Clinical and neurochemical effects of fenfluramine in children with autism.,1/1/1993,"Fifteen children with autism were treated with 60 mg d,l-fenfluramine (FEN) or placebo in a double-blind A-B-A protocol followed immediately by double-blind placebo-controlled crossover administration of FEN (total duration 62 weeks). Both biochemical and clinical outcomes were examined. Biochemically, FEN led to an increase in dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and decreases in whole-blood serotonin (5-HT), plasma norepinephrine (NE), and plasma 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG). The decrease in whole-blood 5-HT was seen only during treatment with FEN. However, NE levels did not return to baseline as long as 8 weeks after the first FEN treatment period. Increases in DOPAC were greater during the second FEN treatment period than the first. Persistent changes in catecholamine regulation may be related to previously reported long-term effects on central nervous system 5-HT after FEN. Clinically, FEN led to a modest decrease in parent, but not teacher, ratings of hyperactivity and to a small reduction in sensorimotor abnormalities. Abnormal social and affectual responses also decreased, but this was not directly related to FEN treatment. Effects on cognition were equivocal. Hyperserotonemic subjects did not differ from normoserotonemic subjects in clinical response. Overall, no significant advantage for the use of FEN could be established.","Leventhal B L, Cook E H, Morford M, Ravitz A J, Heller W, Freedman D X",The Journal of neuropsychiatry and clinical neurosciences,"3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic Acid, Adolescent, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child Behavior Disorders, Child, Preschool, Cognition, Double-Blind Method, Female, Fenfluramine, Humans, Intelligence, Male, Norepinephrine, Placebos, Plasma, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Serotonin, Surveys and Questionnaires",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8369641,"Department of Psychiatry, University of Chicago, IL 60637.",10.1176/Jnp.5.3.307,,,Fenfluramine,"Leventhal, BL",1993,The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences,double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial,62 weeks,15,,,60 mg/d,Neurochemical effects and behavior,Ritvo-Freeman Real Life Rating Scale; neurochemical plasma levels ,No significant improvement in behavior.

92,24132248,"Galantamine efficacy and tolerability as an augmentative therapy in autistic children: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.",7/1/2014,"The role of cholinergic abnormalities in autism was recently evidenced and there is a growing interest in cholinergic modulation, emerging for targeting autistic symptoms. Galantamine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and an allosteric potentiator of nicotinic receptors. This study aimed to evaluate the possible effects of galantamine as an augmentative therapy to risperidone, in autistic children. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, 40 outpatients aged 4-12 years whom had a diagnosis of autism (DSM IV-TR) and a score of 12 or higher on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) Irritability subscale were equally randomized to receive either galantamine (up to 24 mg/day) or placebo, in addition to risperidone (up to 2 mg/day), for 10 weeks. We rated participants by ABC-C and a side effects checklist, at baseline and at weeks 5 and 10. By the study endpoint, the galantamine-treated patients showed significantly greater improvement in the Irritability (P = 0.017) and Lethargy/Social Withdrawal (P = 0.005) subscales than the placebo group. The difference between the two groups in the frequency of side effects was not significant.

93,31780970,A Randomized Controlled Trial of Sertraline in Young Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder.,1/1/2019,"<b>Objective:</b> Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like sertraline have been shown in observational studies and anecdotal reports to improve language development in young children with fragile X syndrome (FXS). A previous controlled trial of sertraline in young children with FXS found significant improvement in expressive language development as measured by the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) among those with comorbid autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in <i>post hoc</i> analysis, prompting the authors to probe whether sertraline is also indicated in nonsyndromic ASD. <b>Methods:</b> The authors evaluated the efficacy of 6 months of treatment with low-dose sertraline in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 58 children with ASD aged 24 to 72 months. <b>Results:</b> 179 subjects were screened for eligibility, and 58 were randomized to sertraline (32) or placebo (26). Eight subjects from the sertraline arm and five from the placebo arm discontinued. Intent-to-treat analysis showed no significant difference from placebo on the primary outcomes (MSEL expressive language raw score and age equivalent combined score) or secondary outcomes. Sertraline was well tolerated, with no difference in side effects between sertraline and placebo groups. No serious adverse events possibly related to study treatment occurred. <b>Conclusion:</b> This randomized controlled trial of sertraline treatment showed no benefit with respect to primary or secondary outcome measures. For the 6-month period, treatment in young children with ASD appears safe, although the long-term side effects of low-dose sertraline in early childhood are unknown. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT02385799.","Potter Laura A, Scholze Danielle A, Biag Hazel Maridith B, Schneider Andrea, Chen Yanjun, Nguyen Danh V, Rajaratnam Akash, Rivera Susan M, Dwyer Patrick S, Tassone Flora, Al Olaby Reem R, Choudhary Nimrah S, Salcedo-Arellano Maria J, Hagerman Randi J",Frontiers in psychiatry,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31780970,"Department of Psychology, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, United States.; College of Health Sciences, California Northstate University, Rancho Cordova, CA, United States.; Institute for Clinical and Translational Science, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, United States.; Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders (MIND) Institute, UC Davis Health, Sacramento, CA, United States.; Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, United States.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, UC Davis Health, Sacramento, CA, United States.; Department of Medicine, University of California, Irvine School of Medicine, Orange, CA, United States.; Department of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, United States.",10.3389/Fpsyt.2019.00810,Yes,No,Sertraline,"Potter, Laura ",6-Nov-19,Frontiers in psychiatry,Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled  ,6 months,58,46 M: 12 F,2-6 y,2.5 mg/d for participants 4yo; 5.0 mg/d for participants 4yo ,Language,"MSEL expressive language raw score, and age equivalent combined score",No significant group differences for primary outcomes. ,,"MSEL subset raw and age equivalent scores in visual reception, fine motor, and receptive language.

94,23886027,A randomized double blind placebo controlled clinical trial of N-Acetylcysteine added to risperidone for treating autistic disorders.,7/25/2013,"This study examined the efficacy and safety of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) augmentation for treating irritability in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Forty children and adolescents met diagnostic criteria for ASD according to DSM-IV. They were randomly allocated into one of the two groups of NAC (1200 mg/day)+risperidone or placebo+risperidone. NAC and placebo were administered in the form of effervescent and in two divided doses for 8 weeks. Irritability subscale score of Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) was considered as the main outcome measure. Adverse effects were also checked. The mean score of irritability in the NAC+risperidone and placebo+risperidone groups at baseline was 13.2(5.3) and 16.7(7.8), respectively. The scores after 8 weeks were 9.7(4.1) and 15.1(7.8), respectively. Repeated measures of ANOVA showed that there was a significant difference between the two groups after 8 weeks. The most common adverse effects in the NAC+risperidone group were constipation (16.1%), increased appetite (16.1%), fatigue (12.9%), nervousness (12.9%), and daytime drowsiness (12.9%). There was no fatal adverse effect. Risperidone plus NAC more than risperidone plus placebo decreased irritability in children and adolescents with ASD. Meanwhile, it did not change the core symptoms of autism. Adverse effects were not common and NAC was generally tolerated well. This trial was registered at http://www.irct.ir.

95,23216716,Intranasal oxytocin versus placebo in the treatment of adults with autism spectrum disorders: a randomized controlled trial.,12/5/2012,"There are no effective medications for the treatment of social cognition/function deficits in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and adult intervention literature in this area is sparse. Emerging data from animal models and genetic association studies as well as early, single-dose intervention studies suggest that the oxytocin system may be a potential therapeutic target for social cognition/function deficits in ASD. The primary aim of this study was to examine the safety/therapeutic effects of intranasal oxytocin versus placebo in adults with ASD, with respect to the two core symptom domains of social cognition/functioning and repetitive behaviors. This was a pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design trial of intranasal oxytocin versus placebo in 19 adults with ASD (16 males; 33.20 Â± 13.29 years). Subjects were randomized to 24 IU intranasal oxytocin or placebo in the morning and afternoon for 6 weeks. Measures of social function/cognition (the Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy) and repetitive behaviors (Repetitive Behavior Scale Revised) were administered. Secondary measures included the Social Responsiveness Scale, Reading-the-Mind-in-the-Eyes Test and the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale - compulsion subscale and quality of life (World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire - emotional/social subscales). Full-information maximum-likelihood parameter estimates were obtained and tested using mixed-effects regression analyses. Although no significant changes were detected in the primary outcome measures after correcting for baseline differences, results suggested improvements after 6 weeks in measures of social cognition (Reading-the-Mind-in-the-Eyes Test, p = 0.002, d = 1.2), and quality of life (World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire - emotion, p = 0.031, d = 0.84), both secondary measures. Oxytocin was well tolerated and no serious adverse effects were reported. This pilot study suggests that there is therapeutic potential to daily administration of intranasal oxytocin in adults with ASD and that larger and longer studies are warranted.

96,32316911,Controlled trial of lovastatin combined with an open-label treatment of a parent-implemented language intervention in youth with fragile X syndrome.,4/22/2020,"The purpose of this study was to conduct a 20-week controlled trial of lovastatin (10 to 40 mg/day) in youth with fragile X syndrome (FXS) ages 10 to 17 years, combined with an open-label treatment of a parent-implemented language intervention (PILI), delivered via distance video teleconferencing to both treatment groups, lovastatin and placebo. A randomized, double-blind trial was conducted at one site in the Sacramento, California, metropolitan area. Fourteen participants were assigned to the lovastatin group; two participants terminated early from the study. Sixteen participants were assigned to the placebo group. Lovastatin or placebo was administered orally in a capsule form, starting at 10 mg and increasing weekly or as tolerated by 10 mg increments, up to a maximum dose of 40 mg daily. A PILI was delivered to both groups for 12 weeks, with 4 activities per week, through video teleconferencing by an American Speech-Language Association-certified Speech-Language Pathologist, in collaboration with a Board-Certified Behavior Analyst. Parents were taught to use a set of language facilitation strategies while interacting with their children during a shared storytelling activity. The main outcome measures included absolute change from baseline to final visit in the means for youth total number of story-related utterances, youth number of different word roots, and parent total number of story-related utterances. Significant increases in all primary outcome measures were observed in both treatment groups. Significant improvements were also observed in parent reports of the severity of spoken language and social impairments in both treatment groups. In all cases, the amount of change observed did not differ across the two treatment groups. Although gains in parental use of the PILI-targeted intervention strategies were observed in both treatment groups, parental use of the PILI strategies was correlated with youth gains in the placebo group and not in the lovastatin group. Participants in both groups demonstrated significant changes in the primary outcome measures. The magnitude of change observed across the two groups was comparable, providing additional support for the efficacy of the use of PILI in youth with FXS.

97,31969977,"Behavioral effects of multiple-dose oxytocin treatment in autism: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial with long-term follow-up.",1/1/2020,"Intranasal administration of the ""prosocial"" neuropeptide oxytocin is increasingly explored as a potential treatment for targeting the core characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, long-term follow-up studies, evaluating the possibility of long-lasting retention effects, are currently lacking. Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design, this pilot clinical trial explored the possibility of long-lasting behavioral effects of 4 weeks of intranasal oxytocin treatment (24 International Units once daily in the morning) in 40 adult men with ASD. To do so, self-report and informant-based questionnaires assessing core autism symptoms and characterizations of attachment were administered at baseline, immediately after 4 weeks of treatment (approximately 24 h after the last nasal spray administration), and at two follow-up sessions, 4 weeks and 1 year post-treatment. No treatment-specific effects were identified in the primary outcome assessing social symptoms (Social Responsiveness Scale, self- and informant-rated). In particular, with respect to self-reported social responsiveness, improvements were evident both in the oxytocin and in the placebo group, yielding no significant between-group difference (<i>p</i> = .37). Also informant-rated improvements in social responsiveness were not significantly larger in the oxytocin, compared to the placebo group (between-group difference: <i>p</i> = .19). Among the secondary outcome measures, treatment-specific improvements were identified in the Repetitive Behavior Scale and State Adult Attachment Measure, indicating reductions in self-reported repetitive behaviors (<i>p</i> = .04) and reduced feelings of avoidance toward others (<i>p</i> = .03) in the oxytocin group compared to the placebo group, up to 1 month and even 1 year post-treatment. Treatment-specific effects were also revealed in screenings of mood states (Profile of Mood States), indicating higher reports of ""vigor"" (feeling energetic, active, lively) in the oxytocin, compared to the placebo group (<i>p</i> = .03). While no treatment-specific improvements were evident in terms of core social symptoms, the current observations of long-term beneficial effects on repetitive behaviors and feelings of avoidance are promising and suggestive of a therapeutic potential of oxytocin treatment for ASD. However, given the exploratory nature of this pilot study, future studies are warranted to evaluate the long-term effects of OT administration further.

98,33536055,Cannabinoid treatment for autism: a proof-of-concept randomized trial.,2/3/2021,"Endocannabinoid dysfunction in animal models of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and accumulating, albeit anecdotal, evidence for efficacy in humans motivated this placebo-controlled double-blind comparison of two oral cannabinoid solutions in 150 participants (age 5-21 years) with ASD. We tested (1) BOL-DP-O-01-W, a whole-plant cannabis extract containing cannabidiol and Î9-tetrahydrocannabinol at a 20:1 ratio and (2) BOL-DP-O-01, purified cannabidiol and Î9-tetrahydrocannabinol at the same ratio. Participants (N = 150) received either placebo or cannabinoids for 12-weeks (testing efficacy) followed by a 4-week washout and predetermined cross-over for another 12 weeks to further assess tolerability. Registered primary efficacy outcome measures were improvement in behavioral problems (differences between whole-plant extract and placebo) on the Home Situation Questionnaire-ASD (HSQ-ASD) and the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale with disruptive behavior anchor points (CGI-I). Secondary measures were Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2) and Autism Parenting Stress Index (APSI). Changes in Total Scores of HSQ-ASD (primary-outcome) and APSI (secondary-outcome) did not differ among groups. Disruptive behavior on the CGI-I (co-primary outcome) was either much or very much improved in 49% on whole-plant extract (n = 45) versus 21% on placebo (n = 47; p = 0.005). Median SRS Total Score (secondary-outcome) improved by 14.9 on whole-plant extract (n = 34) versus 3.6 points after placebo (n = 36); p = 0.009). There were no treatment-related serious adverse events. Common adverse events included somnolence and decreased appetite, reported for 28% and 25% on whole-plant extract, respectively (n = 95); 23% and 21% on pure-cannabinoids (n = 93), and 8% and 15% on placebo (n = 94). Limitations Lack of pharmacokinetic data and a wide range of ages and functional levels among participants warrant caution when interpreting the results. This interventional study provides evidence that BOL-DP-O-01-W and BOL-DP-O-01, administrated for 3 months, are well tolerated. Evidence for efficacy of these interventions are mixed and insufficient. Further testing of cannabinoids in ASD is recommended. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02956226.

99,30071894,A prebiotic intervention study in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).,8/2/2018,"Different dietary approaches, such as gluten and casein free diets, or the use of probiotics and prebiotics have been suggested in autistic spectrum disorders in order to reduce gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances. GI symptoms are of particular interest in this population due to prevalence and correlation with the severity of behavioural traits. Nowadays, there is lack of strong evidence about the effect of dietary interventions on these problems, particularly prebiotics. Therefore, we assessed the impact of exclusion diets and a 6-week BimunoÂ® galactooligosaccharide (B-GOSÂ®) prebiotic intervention in 30 autistic children. The results showed that children on exclusion diets reported significantly lower scores of abdominal pain and bowel movement, as well as lower abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. and Veillonellaceae family, but higher presence of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bacteroides spp. In addition, significant correlations were found between bacterial populations and faecal amino acids in this group, compared to children following an unrestricted diet. Following B-GOSÂ® intervention, we observed improvements in anti-social behaviour, significant increase of Lachnospiraceae family, and significant changes in faecal and urine metabolites. To our knowledge, this is the first study where the effect of exclusion diets and prebiotics has been evaluated in autism, showing potential beneficial effects. A combined dietary approach resulted in significant changes in gut microbiota composition and metabolism suggesting that multiple interventions might be more relevant for the improvement of these aspects as well as psychological traits.

100,21629200,"A prospective double-blind, randomized clinical trial of levocarnitine to treat autism spectrum disorders.",6/1/2011,"L-carnitine was proposed as a potential treatment for patients diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder to improve mitochondrial dysfunction, but no prior randomized controlled trials have been conducted. Thirty subjects diagnosed with an ASD were randomly assigned to receive a standardized regimen (50 mg L-carnitine/kg bodyweight/day) of liquid L-carnitine (n=19) or placebo (n=11) for 3-months. Measures included changes in professionally completed Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), hand muscle testing, and modified clinical global impression (CGI) forms; parent completed Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC), treatment adherence measurement (TAM), frequency and intensity of side effect rating (FISER)/global rating of side effect burden (GRSEB)/patient report of incidence of side effects (PRISE) forms; and lab testing. Significant improvements were observed in CARS (-2.03, 95% CI=-3.7 to -0.31), CGI (-0.69, 95% CI=-1.1 to -0.06), and ATEC scores. Significant correlations between changes in serum free-carnitine levels and positive clinical changes were observed for hand muscle strength (R2=0.23, P=0.046), cognitive scores (R2=0.27, P=0.019), and CARS scores (R2=0.20, P=0.047). Study subjects were protocol-compliant (average adherence was >85%) and generally well-tolerated the L-carnitine therapy given. L-carnitine therapy (50 mg/kilogram-bodyweight/day) administered for 3-months significantly improved several clinical measurements of ASD severity, but subsequent studies are recommended.","Geier David A, Kern Janet K, Davis Georgia, King Paul G, Adams James B, Young John L, Geier Mark R",Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,"Carnitine, Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Child, Preschool, Cognition, Cohort Studies, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Placebos",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21629200,"The Institute of Chronic Illnesses, Inc., Silver Spring, MD, USA. mgeier@comcast.net",10.12659/Msm.881792,,,Levocarnitine,"Geier, David",1-Jun-11,Medical Science Monitor,Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled  ,3 months,30,4 F: 23 M,3-10 y,50 mg L-cartinine/kg bodyweight/day,,"Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), hand muscle testing, and modified clinical global impression (CGI) forms",Significantly improved clinical measurements over time. ,,"Serum free-carnitine.

101,19948625,Aripiprazole in the treatment of irritability in children and adolescents with autistic disorder.,12/1/2009,"The objective of this study was to evaluate short-term efficacy and safety of aripiprazole in the treatment of irritability in children and adolescents with autistic disorder who were manifesting behaviors such as tantrums, aggression, self-injurious behavior, or a combination of these. This 8-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was conducted of children and adolescents (aged 6-17 years) with autistic disorder. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to flexibly dosed aripiprazole (target dosage: 5, 10, or 15 mg/day) or placebo. Efficacy outcome measures included the Aberrant Behavior Checklist irritability subscale and the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement score (CGI-I). Safety and tolerability were also assessed. Ninety-eight patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 51) or aripiprazole (n = 47). Mean improvement in Aberrant Behavior Checklist irritability subscale score was significantly greater with aripiprazole than with placebo from week 1 through week 8. Aripiprazole demonstrated significantly greater global improvements than placebo, as assessed by the mean CGI-I score from week 1 through week 8; however, clinically significant residual symptoms may still persist for some patients. Discontinuation rates as a result of adverse events (AEs) were 10.6% for aripiprazole and 5.9% for placebo. Extrapyramidal symptom-related AE rates were 14.9% for aripiprazole and 8.0% for placebo. No serious AEs were reported. Mean weight gain was 2.0 kg on aripiprazole and 0.8 kg on placebo at week 8. Aripiprazole was efficacious in children and adolescents with irritability associated with autistic disorder and was generally safe and well tolerated.","Owen Randall, Sikich Linmarie, Marcus Ronald N, Corey-Lisle Patricia, Manos George, McQuade Robert D, Carson William H, Findling Robert L",Pediatrics,"Adolescent, Antipsychotic Agents, Aripiprazole, Autistic Disorder, Child, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Irritable Mood, Male, Personality Assessment, Piperazines, Quinolones, Treatment Outcome, Weight Gain",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19948625,"Bristol-Myers Squibb, 5 Research Parkway, Wallingford, Connecticut 06492, USA. randall.owen@bms.com",10.1542/Peds.2008-3782,Yes,"Yes (vanilla, peppermint)",Aripiprazole,"Owen, Randall",Dec-09,American Academy of Pediatrics,Randomized Double-blind Placebo Controlled  ,8 weeks,98,86 M: 12 F,6-17 y; Mean: 8.8-9.7 y,"Flexible dose: 5, 10, or 15 mg/d",Irritability,Caregiver rated ABC-irritability subscale,"""Aripiprazole was significantly more efficacious than placebo at treating irrtabilityâ¦ on the caregiver-rated ABC irritability subscale.""","Hyperactivity, stereotypy, inappropriate speech.

102,33101079,"Effects of Probiotic Supplementation on Gastrointestinal, Sensory and Core Symptoms in Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Randomized Controlled Trial.",1/1/2020,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis has been recently recognized as a key modulator of neuropsychiatric health. In this framework, probiotics (recently named ""psychobiotics"") may modulate brain activity and function, possibly improving the behavioral profiles of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We evaluated the effects of probiotics on autism in a double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 85 preschoolers with ASD (mean age, 4.2 years; 84% boys). Participants were randomly assigned to probiotics (De Simone Formulation) (n=42) or placebo (n=43) for six months. Sixty-three (74%) children completed the trial. No differences between groups were detected on the primary outcome measure, the Total Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule - Calibrated Severity Score (ADOS-CSS). An exploratory secondary analysis on subgroups of children with or without Gastrointestinal Symptoms (GI group, n= 30; NGI group, n=55) revealed in the NGI group treated with probiotics a significant decline in ADOS scores as compared to that in the placebo group, with a mean reduction of 0.81 in Total ADOS CSS and of 1.14 in Social-Affect ADOS CSS over six months. In the GI group treated with probiotics we found greater improvements in some GI symptoms, adaptive functioning, and sensory profiles than in the GI group treated with placebo. These results suggest potentially positive effects of probiotics on core autism symptoms in a subset of ASD children independent of the specific intermediation of the probiotic effect on GI symptoms. Further studies are warranted to replicate and extend these promising findings on a wider population with subsets of ASD patients which share targets of intervention on the microbiota-gut-brain axis.

103,30979038,"Effects of <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> PS128 on Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder in Taiwan: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.",4/11/2019,"This four-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigated the effects of <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> PS128 (PS128) on boys with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) aged 7-15 in Taiwan. All subjects fulfilled the criteria for ASD diagnosis of DSM-V and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R). Questionnaires used for the primary outcome measure include the Autism Behavior Checklist-Taiwan version (ABC-T), the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). The Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham-IV-Taiwan version (SNAP-IV) and the Clinical Global Impression-improvement (CGI-I) were used for the secondary outcome measure. The results showed that PS128 ameliorated opposition/defiance behaviors, and that the total score of SNAP-IV for younger children (aged 712) improved significantly compared with the placebo group. Additionally, several elements were also notably improved in the PS128 group after 28-day consumption of PS128. Further studies are needed to better clarify the effects of PS128 for younger children with ASD on broader symptoms.","Liu Yen-Wenn, Liong Min Tze, Chung Yu-Chu Ella, Huang Hui-Yi, Peng Wu-Shun, Cheng Yun-Fang, Lin Yu-Siou, Wu Yu-Yu, Tsai Ying-Chieh",Nutrients,"Adolescent, Age Factors, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Child Behavior, Double-Blind Method, Humans, Lactobacillus plantarum, Male, Placebos, Probiotics, Social Behavior, Surveys and Questionnaires, Taiwan",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30979038,"Department of Psychology, National Taiwan University, Taipei 10090, Taiwan. huanghuyiii@gmail.com.; Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei 11221, Taiwan. hiyunfang@gmail.com.; Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei 11221, Taiwan. skywenn@gmail.com.; Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei 11221, Taiwan. tsaiyc@ym.edu.tw.; YuNing Clinic, Taipei 10664, Taiwan. ruthyuyuwu@gmail.com.; Department of Psychology, National Chengchi University, Taipei 11605, Taiwan. linyusiou@gmail.com.; Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei 11221, Taiwan. catpet1022@hotmail.com.; School of Industrial Technology, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang 11800, Malaysia. mintze.liong@usm.my.; Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University, Taipei 10050, Taiwan. eesabella1126@gmail.com.",10.3390/Nu11040820,No,No,Probiotics (Lactobacillus plantarum PS128),"Liu, Yen-Wenn",Apr-19,Nutrients,RCT,4 weeks,80,All male,7-15 y (mean: 10.01 SD: 2.32),3 x 10^10 CFU/capsule of PS128,Core symptoms,"ABC-Taiwan version, SRS, CBCL","Subjects in the PS128 group showed nominal improvements in ABC-T-body and object use, SRS-total score, CBCL-anxiety and CBCL-rule breaking behavior.

104,34062986,"Probiotic and Oxytocin Combination Therapy in Patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Randomized, Double-Blinded, Placebo-Controlled Pilot Trial.",5/5/2021,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a rapidly growing neurodevelopmental disorder. Both probiotics and oxytocin were reported to have therapeutic potential; however, the combination therapy has not yet been studied. We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 2-stage pilot trial in 35 individuals with ASD aged 3-20 years (median = 10.30 years). Subjects were randomly assigned to receive daily <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> PS128 probiotic (6 Ã 10<sup>10</sup> CFUs) or a placebo for 28 weeks; starting on week 16, both groups received oxytocin. The primary outcomes measure socio-behavioral severity using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC). The secondary outcomes include measures of the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, fecal microbiome, blood serum inflammatory markers, and oxytocin. All outcomes were compared between the two groups at baseline, 16 weeks, and 28 weeks into treatment. We observed improvements in ABC and SRS scores and significant improvements in CGI-improvement between those receiving probiotics and oxytocin combination therapy compared to those receiving placebo (<i>p</i> < 0.05). A significant number of favorable gut microbiome network hubs were also identified after combination therapy (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The favorable social cognition response of the combination regimen is highly correlated with the abundance of the Eubacterium hallii group. Our findings suggest synergic effects between probiotics PS128 and oxytocin in ASD patients, although further investigation is warranted.","Kong Xue-Jun, Liu Jun, Liu Kevin, Koh Madelyn, Sherman Hannah, Liu Siyu, Tian Ruiyi, Sukijthamapan Piyawat, Wang Jiuju, Fong Michelle, Xu Lei, Clairmont Cullen, Jeong Min-Seo, Li Alice, Lopes Maria, Hagan Veronica, Dutton Tess, Chan Suk-Tak Phoebe, Lee Hang, Kendall Amy, Kwong Kenneth, Song Yiqing",Nutrients,"Adolescent, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Biomarkers, Child, Child, Preschool, Clostridiales, Combined Modality Therapy, Double-Blind Method, Feces, Female, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Inflammation Mediators, Lactobacillus plantarum, Male, Oxytocin, Pilot Projects, Probiotics, Social Cognition, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34062986,"Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, Indiana University, Richard M.

105,24502859,A randomized controlled trial investigating the safety and efficacy of aripiprazole in the long-term maintenance treatment of pediatric patients with irritability associated with autistic disorder.,1/1/2014,"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole versus placebo in preventing relapse of irritability symptoms associated with autistic disorder in pediatric patients. This multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, relapse-prevention trial enrolled patients (6-17 years) who met the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DMS-IV-TR) criteria for autistic disorder and who also had serious behavioral problems (ie, tantrums, aggression, self-injurious behavior, or a combination of these behavioral problems) between March 2011 and June 2012. In phase 1, single-blind aripiprazole was flexibly dosed (2-15 mg/d) for 13-26 weeks. Patients with a stable response (â¥ 25% decrease in Aberrant Behavior Checklist-irritability subscale score and a rating of ""much improved"" or ""very much improved"" on the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale) for 12 consecutive weeks were randomized into phase 2 to continue aripiprazole or switch to placebo. Treatment was continued until relapse or up to 16 weeks. The primary end point was time from randomization to relapse. Eighty-five patients were randomized in phase 2. The difference in time to relapse between aripiprazole and placebo was not statistically significant (P = .097). Kaplan-Meier relapse rates at week 16 were 35% for aripiprazole and 52% for placebo (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.57; number needed to treat [NNT] = 6). The most common adverse events during phase 1 were weight increase (25.2%), somnolence (14.8%), and vomiting (14.2%); and, during phase 2 (aripiprazole vs placebo), they were upper respiratory tract infection (10.3% vs 2.3%), constipation (5.1% vs 0%), and movement disorder (5.1% vs 0%). In this study, there was no statistically significant difference between aripiprazole and placebo in time to relapse during maintenance therapy. However, the HR and NNT suggest some patients will benefit from maintenance treatment. Patients receiving aripiprazole should be periodically reassessed to determine the continued need for treatment.

106,27316706,"A randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial of a fixed dose of N-acetyl cysteine in children with autistic disorder ",6/11/2016,"Objective: Oxidative stress, inflammation and heavy metals have been implicated in the aetiology of autistic disorder. N-acetyl cysteine has been shown to modulate these pathways, providing a rationale to trial N-acetyl cysteine for autistic disorder. There are now two published pilot studies suggesting efficacy, particularly in symptoms of irritability. This study aimed to explore if N-acetyl cysteine is a useful treatment for autistic disorder. Method: This was a placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial of 500 mg/day oral N-acetyl cysteine over 6 months, in addition to treatment as usual, in children with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision diagnosis of autistic disorder. The study was conducted in Victoria, Australia. The primary outcome measures were the Social Responsiveness Scale, Children's Communication Checklist-Second Edition and the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised. Additionally, demographic data, the parent-completed Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Social Communication Questionnaire and clinician-administered Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule were completed. Results: A total of 102 children were randomised into the study, and 98 (79 male, 19 female; age range: 3.1-9.9 years) attended the baseline appointment with their parent/guardian, forming the Intention to Treat sample. There were no differences between N-acetyl cysteine and placebo-treated groups on any of the outcome measures for either primary or secondary endpoints. There was no significant difference in the number and severity of adverse events between groups. Conclusion: This study failed to demonstrate any benefit of adjunctive N-acetyl cysteine in treating autistic disorder. While this may reflect a true null result, methodological issues particularly the lower dose utilised in this study may be confounders.
