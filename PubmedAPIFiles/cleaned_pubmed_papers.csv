Previous studies showed significantly less alpha activity in autism than normal children. Therefore, we studied the effects of anodal tDCS on peak alpha frequency (PAF) related to autism treatment evaluation checklist (ATEC). Twenty male children with autism were randomly assigned in a crossover design to receive a single session of both active and sham tDCS stimulation (11 mA) over F3 (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). Pre- to postsession changes in a measure of cortical activity impacted by tDCS (PAF) and ATEC were compared between groups. We also examined the associations between pre- and postsession changes in the PAF and ATEC. The results show significant pre- to postsession improvements in two domains of ATEC (social and health/behavior domains) following active tDCS, relative to sham treatment. PAF also significantly increased at the stimulation site, and an increase in PAF was significantly associated with improvements in the two domains of ATEC impacted by tDCS. The findings suggest that a single session of anodal tDCS over the F3 may have clinical benefits in children with autism and that those benefits may be related to an increase in PAF.","Amatachaya Anuwat, Jensen Mark P, Patjanasoontorn Niramol, Auvichayapat Narong, Suphakunpinyo Chanyut, Janjarasjitt Suparerk, Ngernyam Niran, Aree-uea Benchaporn, Auvichayapat Paradee",Behavioural neurology,"Autistic Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Cross-Over Studies, Electric Stimulation Therapy, Electroencephalography, Humans, Male, Neuropsychological Tests, Prefrontal Cortex, Time Factors, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25861158,"Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen 40002, Thailand.; Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Washington, 1959 NE Pacific Street, P.O.

Forty-six children and adolescents with cerebral palsy were randomly assigned to either active (1 mA anodal) or sham (placebo) tDCS over the left primary motor cortex (Ml) on five consecutive days. Both group also received routine physical therapy. Measures of spasticity and passive range of motion (PROM) were administered before treatment, immediately after treatment, and at 24- and 48-hours follow-up. Participants assigned to active tDCS treatment evidenced significantly more pre- to immediately post-treatment reductions in spasticity than participants assigned to the sham (p = 0.004, p<O. 001l, andp = 0.004 for shoulder wrist, and fingers respectively) and these improvement in spasticity maintainedfor at least 48 hours for wrist joints (p = 0.023). There was only one participant in the active tDCS condition developed erythematous rash. However, all participants tolerated the tDCS well without any serious adverse events.

25027640,10.1016/J.Clinph.2014.05.034,The effects of transcranial direct current stimulation in patients with neuropathic pain from spinal cord injury.,2015-02-01,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has demonstrated efficacy for reducing neuropathic pain, but the respective mechanisms remain largely unknown. The current study tested the hypothesis that pain reduction with tDCS is associated with an increase in the peak frequency spectrum density in the theta-alpha range. Twenty patients with spinal cord injury and bilateral neuropathic pain received single sessions of both sham and anodal tDCS (2 mA) over the left primary motor area (M1) for 20 min. Treatment order was randomly assigned. Pre- to post-procedure changes in pain intensity and peak frequency of electroencephalogram spectral analysis were compared between treatment conditions. The active treatment condition (anodal tDCS over M1) but not sham treatment resulted in significant decreases in pain intensity. In addition, consistent with the study hypothesis, peak theta-alpha frequency (PTAF) assessed from an electrode placed over the site of stimulation increased more from pre- to post-session among participants in the active tDCS condition, relative to those in the sham tDCS condition. Moreover, we found a significant association between a decrease in pain intensity and an increase in PTAF at the stimulation site. The findings are consistent with the possibility that anodal tDCS over the left M1 may be effective, at least in part, because it results in an increase in M1 cortical excitability, perhaps due to a pain inhibitory effect of motor cortex stimulation that may influence the descending pain modulation system. Future research is needed to determine if there is a causal association between increased left anterior activity and pain reduction. The results provide new findings regarding the effects of tDCS on neuropathic pain and brain oscillation changes.","Ngernyam Niran, Jensen Mark P, Arayawichanon Preeda, Auvichayapat Narong, Tiamkao Somsak, Janjarasjitt Suparerk, Punjaruk Wiyada, Amatachaya Anuwat, Aree-uea Benchaporn, Auvichayapat Paradee",Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology,"Adult, Aged, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Electroencephalography, Evoked Potentials, Motor, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Motor Cortex, Neuralgia, Spinal Cord Injuries, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25027640,"Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, 40002 Thailand.; Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, USA.; Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, 40002 Thailand.; Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, 40002 Thailand.; Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, 40002 Thailand.; Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, 40002 Thailand.

In animal models of FXS and of ASD, GABA-B agonists have improved both brain and behavioral phenotypes, including social behavior. A phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial found that the GABA-B agonist arbaclofen improved social avoidance symptoms in FXS. A pilot open-label trial of arbaclofen suggested similar benefits in ASD. We therefore evaluated arbaclofen in a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study of 150 participants, aged 5-21 years, with ASD. No difference from placebo was detected on the primary outcome measure, the parent-rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist Social Withdrawal/Lethargy subscale. However, a specified secondary analysis found improvement on the clinician-rated Clinical Global Impression of Severity. An exploratory post hoc analysis of participants with a consistent rater across the trial revealed greater improvement in the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales II socialization domain in participants receiving arbaclofen. Affect lability (11%) and sedation (9%) were the most common adverse events. In this exploratory study, secondary analyses suggest that arbaclofen may have the potential to improve symptoms in some children with ASD, but further study will be needed to replicate and extend these initial findings.","Veenstra-VanderWeele Jeremy, Cook Edwin H, King Bryan H, Zarevics Peter, Cherubini Maryann, Walton-Bowen Karen, Bear Mark F, Wang Paul P, Carpenter Randall L",Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,"Adolescent, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Baclofen, Child, Child, Preschool, Cross-Over Studies, Female, GABA-B Receptor Agonists, Humans, Male, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27748740,"Seaside Therapeutics, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Autism Speaks, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.; The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.; Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative, New York, NY, USA."

Psychometric investigations have shown a multifactorial structure and some items have limited utility assessing symptom severity in children. To address these issues, we developed and evaluated optimized 10- and 20-item PANSS short-forms (PANSS10 and PANSS20) using patient-level clinical trial data. This study further assesses these optimized forms using independent clinical trial data. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> We examined patient-level data from a randomized pediatric schizophrenia trial comparing paliperidone ER to aripiprazole. Data were accessed through the Yale Open Data Access (YODA) secure platform. Analyses included confirmatory factor analyses, graded response models, ω score reliability, internal consistency, sensitivity to change, and criterion validity versus the Clinical Global Impressions of Severity (CGI-S). Bland-Altman analyses examined score calibration versus the 30-item PANSS and inclusion cut scores. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Participants (<i>N</i> = 288) were ages 12 to 17 years (<i>M</i> = 15.3, SD = 1.46; 66% male). Total scores for the PANSS10 and PANSS20 showed strong correlations with the 30-item PANSS (0.90 and 0.97, respectively). Average inter-item correlations were 0.10 and 0.14 and ω<sup>Total</sup> reliabilities were 0.74 and 0.85. Both PANSS10 and PANSS20 scores showed reliability >0.80-2.3 to 4.5 SD and -3.0 to 6.0 SD about mean symptom severity, respectively. Sensitivity to treatment was also similar (partial <i>eta</i> squared 0.23 and 0.22), as was correlation with CGI-S at baseline (0.45 and 0.48; not significantly different). The mean item-average discrepancy with the 30-item PANSS was 0.095 for PANSS10 and 0.033 for PANSS20. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> The optimized PANSS forms continue to show impressive reliability, validity, and calibration compared with the 30-item PANSS. Researchers should consider replacing the 30-item PANSS with the PANSS10 as a clinical outcome and screening measure due to its length and psychometric performance.","Langfus Joshua A, Youngstrom Eric A, Daniel David, Busner Joan, Findling Robert L",Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology,"Humans, Child, Male, Reproducibility of Results, Adolescent, Female, Aripiprazole, Psychometrics, Antipsychotic Agents, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Schizophrenia, Paliperidone Palmitate, Severity of Illness Index",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39419042,"Signant Health, Wayne, Pennsylvania, USA.; Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA."

Additional assessments included: clinical global impressions-bipolar disorder (CGI-BP) Overall and mania scales, child global assessment scale (CGAS), and parent and subject general behavior inventory. Response was compared across seven operational definitions. Cohen's κ and Spearman's correlation tested relationships between various response definitions or changes in outcome measures and clinically meaningful improvement (defined as a CGI-BP overall improvement score of 1 or 2). Response rates varied depending upon the operational definition, but were highest for 95% reliable change (statistical method used to determine individual change from previous assessment) and ≥33% reduction in YMRS total score. Response rate definitions with the highest validity in terms of predicting clinically meaningful improvement were: ≥50% reduction on YMRS (κ=0.64), a composite definition of response (YMRS <12.5, children's depression rating scale-revised (CDRS-R) ≤40, and CGAS ≥51; κ=0.59), and 95% reliable change on the CGAS or 33% reduction on YMRS (κ=0.56).

Overall time to all-cause discontinuation was longer for aripiprazole 10 mg/day (15.6 weeks) and aripiprazole 30 mg/day (9.5 weeks) compared with placebo (5.3 weeks; both p < 0.05 versus placebo). Both aripiprazole doses were significantly superior to placebo regarding response rates, Children's Global Assessment of Functioning and Clinical Global Impressions-Bipolar severity of overall and mania scores at endpoint in all analyses. Commonly reported adverse events included headache, somnolence, and extrapyramidal disorder.   Aripiprazole 10 mg/day and 30 mg/day were superior to placebo and generally well tolerated in pediatric subjects with bipolar I disorder up to 30 weeks.

This was a post-hoc analysis of data from a 4-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate which informants detect response to treatment with aripiprazole in pediatric subjects experiencing a mixed or manic episode associated with bipolar I disorder. Efficacy assessments included clinician-rated scales and the parent- and subject-rated 10-item General Behavior Inventory Mania (GBI-M10) and Depression (GBI-D10) scales. Cohen's d quantified effect sizes for total scale scores and individual line items. Parent-GBI-M10 total, clinician-rated Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total, and Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar Disorder (CGI-BP) Mania scores produced similar effect sizes, suggesting that the parent-GBI-M10 is sensitive to treatment-related improvements in manic symptoms. Aripiprazole improved a broad spectrum of parent-rated mania symptoms; six parent-GBI-M10 line item effect sizes were moderate (>0.5) in at least one of the two aripiprazole treatment arms (10 or 30 mg/day). Subject-completed GBI-M10 line item effect sizes were consistently smaller, indicating that the subjects' experience of treatment effects were less pronounced. Study inclusion/exclusion criteria may limit generalizability of these findings. Parent ratings of mania severity were in agreement with clinician ratings, indicating that parent-rated assessments can be valuable in detecting symptom change over the course of treatment. These data support the use of the parent-GBI-M10 as an outcome measure in research and clinical settings.","Findling Robert L, Youngstrom Eric A, Zhao Joan, Marcus Ron, Andersson Candace, McQuade Robert, Mankoski Raymond",Journal of affective disorders,"Adolescent, Antipsychotic Agents, Aripiprazole, Bipolar Disorder, Child, Depression, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Parents, Piperazines, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Quinolones, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23044285,"University Hospitals Case Medical Center/Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA. robert.findling@uhhospitals.org"

During phase 2, patients either remained on their current aripiprazole regimen or began a double-blind taper with aripiprazole discontinued and switched to placebo. The primary outcome measure for phase 2 was time to discontinuation due to a mood event. Patients were recruited between May 2004 and November 2008.

Other symptoms associated with depression (tension associated with feeling anxious, irritability, and lack of concentration) did not show statistically significant changes on either scale at end point. The IDS identified an additional 3 important depression-related symptoms (diminished libido, view of self, and interpersonal sensitivity) that showed significant rapid and sustained improvement with adjunctive aripiprazole. This cross-correlation analysis confirmed that improvement in core depressive symptoms with adjunctive aripiprazole was identified by both clinicians and patients.

As reported, adjunctive aripiprazole was associated with a two-fold higher remission rate than adjunctive placebo. This, and previous studies, have shown that discontinuations due to adverse events were low and completion rates were high, and has indicated that both antidepressant and aripiprazole in combination were relatively well-tolerated and safe.

Data from 2 identical 14-week studies (an 8-week prospective ADT treatment phase and a 6-week randomized, double-blind phase) of aripiprazole augmentation were pooled to evaluate efficacy and safety in the 2 subgroups. The primary efficacy endpoint was mean change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score from end of ADT treatment to end of randomized treatment (last observation carried forward). Anxious depression was defined by a Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression anxiety/somatization factor score ≥ 7, and atypical depression was defined by previously described criteria on the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report. Both anxious and atypical subtypes were defined based on symptoms at entry into prospective ADT (week 0). Patients were enrolled between June 2004 and April 2006 in one study and from September 2004 to December 2006 in the other (total randomized population, N = 742; anxious/nonanxious population, N = 740; atypical/nonatypical population, N = 737). Completion rates were between 84% and 90% and comparable across all subgroups, with low discontinuations due to adverse events. Patients receiving adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated significantly greater improvement in MADRS total score versus patients receiving adjunctive placebo, starting at week 1 or week 2 and continuing through to endpoint (anxious: -8.72 vs. -6.17, p ≤ .001; nonanxious: -8.61 vs. -4.97, p ≤ .001; atypical: -9.31 vs. -5.15, p ≤ .001; nonatypical: -8.08 vs. -6.22, p < .05). At endpoint, remission rates were also significantly higher with adjunctive aripiprazole versus adjunctive placebo (p < .05) in all subgroups. Treatment emergent adverse event profile was similar in all subgroups and comparable to the total population. Reporting of akathisia and weight gain on aripiprazole treatment did not differ between subgroups.

This was a post hoc analysis of data from two 8-week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trials to evaluate the efficacy of aripiprazole dosed flexibly (2-15 mg/day, n=47) or fixed (5, 10, or 15 mg/day, n = 166) versus placebo (flexibly dosed, n = 51; fixed dose, n = 52). The effects of treatment on the 58 ABC items were evaluated. Statistically significantly greater improvement was seen with aripiprazole versus placebo (p < 0.05) for all arms in both trials on the ABC-Irritability total subscale score and on the following individual ABC-Irritability items: Mood changes quickly, cries/screams inappropriately, and stamps feet/bangs objects. Several additional items measuring tantrum-like behaviors improved in the flexibly dosed trial and at least one arm of the fixed-dose trial (p < 0.05). Measures of self-injurious behavior, which had low baseline values, demonstrated numerical, but not statistically significant, improvement in both trials. Statistically significantly greater improvement in ABC Stereotypic Behavior and Hyperactivity total subscale scores was also consistent across all arms in both trials. In particular, there was a cluster of items related to hyperkinesis that were consistently sensitive to treatment.

As a target of intervention, improvements in cognition may lead to improvements in functional outcome. The present paper is the first report, to our knowledge, on the neurocognitive effects of aripiprazole. Unlike other second-generation antipsychotics, aripiprazole is a D(2) and D(3) receptor partial agonist. It is unknown what effects this unusual pharmacological profile may yield on neurocognition. The present open-label study included data on 169 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were randomly treated with aripiprazole or olanzapine. Subjects received a neurocognitive battery at baseline, week 8, and 26. The aripiprazole group had a significantly greater dropout rate than the olanzapine group. Neurocognitive data were reduced through a principal components analysis that yielded a three-factor solution. The factors were general cognitive functioning, executive functioning, and verbal learning. For general cognitive functioning, both groups improved from baseline and the effects were relatively stable over the 26-week protocol. There were no differential treatment effects. For executive functioning, neither group improved significantly from baseline. For verbal learning, the aripiprazole group improved significantly from baseline to the 8th and 26th week of assessment, and there was a between-group effect favoring aripiprazole over olanzapine that was largely attributable to the differences in performance within the 8th week. Separate analyses were conducted for a measure of sustained attention (Continuous Performance Test-Identical Pairs). There were no differential treatment effects on this measure. The findings from this open-label study suggest that the neurocognitive effects of aripiprazole are at least as good as those of olanzapine.","Kern Robert S, Green Michael F, Cornblatt Barbara A, Owen J Randall, McQuade Robert D, Carson William H, Ali Mirza, Marcus Ron",Psychopharmacology,"Adult, Antipsychotic Agents, Aripiprazole, Benzodiazepines, Brain, Cognition, Female, Humans, Learning, Male, Memory, Middle Aged, Olanzapine, Piperazines, Quinolones",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16810506,"Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90073, and Zucker Hillside Hospital, North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, Glen Oaks, NY, USA. rkern@ucla.edu"

This randomized double-blind parallel-group study was conducted in three academic medical centers and a single private pediatric practice. Eighty children or adolescents (aged 6-17 yrs) with autistic disorder were enrolled, and 61 patients were randomized to the study drug. Of those patients, 51 completed the 10-week trial, and 31 completed an optional 12-week blinded extension phase. All patients were treated with 2 weeks of placebo before random assignment to receive aripiprazole (31 patients) or risperidone (30 patients) for 10 weeks. Sixteen placebo responders (20%) were excluded from further analysis. Drug dosing followed U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling, and weekly dosage adjustments were allowed until week 4; patients were then maintained on a fixed dose for 6 additional weeks. Safety, physical, and psychological assessments were recorded weekly or every 2 weeks. No significant differences in severity of illness between the aripiprazole and risperidone groups were noted at baseline. All patients significantly improved on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability subscale after 1 week and continued for the remaining 9 weeks and the extension phase. Improvement was greatest in the risperidone group at every assessment period and was statistically significantly better than that in the aripiprazole group at weeks 3 and 6 (p<0.05). No dose-limiting adverse events occurred during the dose-titration period.

In a 2 × 2 design, 128 children with ASD and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were randomly assigned ATX, PT+placebo, PT+ATX, or placebo alone. PT was weekly for 10 weeks, and then monthly. ATX/placebo was titrated over 6 weeks [≤1.8 mg/kg/d], and then maintained until week 10. Responders continued to week 34 or nonresponse. Placebo nonresponders had a 10-week ATX open trial; ATX nonresponders were treated clinically. All continued to week 34. With no further treatment from the study, all were invited to follow-up (FU) at 1.5 years postbaseline; 94 (73%) participated. Changes from Week 34 to FU and from baseline to FU were tested by one-way analysis of variance or chi-squared test. PT versus no PT was tested by chi-squared test, Fisher's exact test, Welch's t-test, Student's t-test, and Mann-Whitney's U test. For the whole sample, the primary outcomes (parent-rated ADHD on the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham [SNAP] scale and noncompliance on the Home Situations Questionnaire [HSQ]) deteriorated mildly from week 34 to FU, but were still substantially better than baseline (SNAP: t = 12.177, df = 93, p < 0.001; HSQ: t = 8.999, df = 93, p < 0.001). On the SNAP, 61% improved ≥30% from baseline (67% did at week 34); on noncompliance, 56% improved ≥30% from baseline (77% did at week 34). Outcomes with PT were not significantly better than without PT (SNAP p = 0.30; HSQ p = 0.27). Originally assigned treatment groups did not differ significantly. Only 34% still took ATX; 27% were taking stimulants; and 25% took no medication. The majority retained their 34-week end-of-study improvement 10 months later, even though most participants stopped ATX. For some children, ATX continuation may not be necessary for continued benefit or other drugs may be necessary. Cautious individual clinical experimentation may be justified.

Between November 22, 2016, and September 3, 2019, individuals were screened and randomly assigned to treatment groups. The primary efficacy analysis population comprised participants taking age-adjusted balovaptan equivalent to a 10-mg adult dose and participants from the concurrently randomized placebo group. This multicenter trial took place across 41 sites in the US. Participants were aged 5 to 17 years with diagnosed ASD and an IQ of 70 or greater. Data were analyzed from April 8 to November 16, 2020. Participants were randomly assigned to daily 4-mg or 10-mg adult-equivalent balovaptan or placebo, until the 4-mg group was discontinued. The primary end point was change from baseline on the Vineland-II two-domain composite (2DC; socialization and communication domains) score at week 24. Between November 2016 and September 2019, a total of 599 individuals were screened and 339 participants were randomly assigned to receive 4-mg balovaptan adult-equivalent dose (91 [26.8%]), 10-mg balovaptan adult-equivalent dose (126 [37.2%]), or placebo (122 [36.0%]). Primary analysis included 86 participants assigned to receive 10-mg balovaptan adult-equivalent dose and 81 assigned to receive placebo (mean [SD] age, 12.1 [3.4] years; 139 male participants [83.2%]). No statistically significant differences were observed between the balovaptan and placebo groups in change from baseline on the Vineland-II 2DC score at week 24 (difference in adjusted least-squares mean, -0.16; 90% CI, -2.56 to 2.23; P = .91). No improvements for balovaptan vs placebo were observed at week 24 for any secondary end points. Balovaptan was well tolerated with no emerging safety concerns.

Here we report the results of a multicenter phase 2B study primarily to assess dose/response and safety effects of bumetanide. Efficacy outcome measures included the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), the Social Responsive Scale (SRS) and the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Improvement scale (CGI-I). Eighty-eight patients with ASD spanning across the entire pediatric population (2-18 years old) were subdivided in four age groups and randomized to receive bumetanide (0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 mg twice daily) or placebo for 3 months. The mean CARS value was significantly improved in the completers group (P: 0.015). Also, 23 treated children had more than a six-point improvement in the CARS compared with only one placebo-treated individual. Bumetanide significantly improved CGI (P: 0.0043) and the SRS score by more than 10 points (P: 0.02). The most frequent adverse events were hypokalemia, increased urine elimination, loss of appetite, dehydration and asthenia. Hypokalemia occurred mainly at the beginning of the treatment at 1.0 and 2.0 mg twice-daily doses and improved gradually with oral potassium supplements. The frequency and incidence of adverse event were directly correlated with the dose of bumetanide.

Sixty children with autism or Asperger syndrome (3-11 years old) received for 3 months placebo or bumetanide (1 mg daily), followed by 1-month wash out. Determination of the severity of autism was made with video films at day 0 (D0) and D90 by blind, independent evaluators.

A total of 120 children were enrolled into the study and randomly assigned to either 0.5 mg bumetanide or placebo. In the final sample, 119 children received at least one dose of bumetanide (59 children) or placebo (60 children) were included in the final analysis. The primary outcome was a reduction in the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) score, and the secondary outcomes were the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI) -Global Improvement (CGI-I) score at 3 months and the change from baseline to 3-month in the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to measure γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate neurotransmitter concentrations in the insular cortex (IC) before and after the treatment. As compared with the placebo, bumetanide treatment was significantly better in reducing the severity. No patient withdrew from the trial due to adverse events. The superiority of bumetanide to placebo in reducing insular GABA, measured using MRS, was demonstrated. The clinical improvement was associated with a decrease in insular GABA in the bumetanide group. In conclusion, this trial in a large group of young children with predominantly moderate and severe ASD demonstrated that bumetanide is safe and effective in improving the core symptoms of ASD. However, the clinical significance remains uncertain, and future multi-center clinical trials are required to replicate these findings and confirm the clinical significance using a variety of outcome measures.","Dai Yuan, Zhang Lingli, Yu Juehua, Zhou Xin, He Hua, Ji Yiting, Wang Kai, Du Xiujuan, Liu Xin, Tang Yun, Deng Shining, Langley Christelle, Li Wei-Guang, Zhang Jun, Feng Jianfeng, Sahakian Barbara J, Luo Qiang, Li Fei",Science bulletin,"Humans, Child, Child, Preschool, Bumetanide, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Glutamic Acid, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36654288,"Institute of Science and Technology for Brain-Inspired Intelligence, Ministry of Education-Key Laboratory of Computational Neuroscience and Brain-Inspired Intelligence and Research and Research Institute of Intelligent Complex Systems, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China; State Key Laboratory of Medical Neurobiology and Ministry of Education Frontiers Center for Brain Science, Institutes of Brain Science and National Clinical Research Center for Aging and Medicine, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200040, China.

32066666,10.1038/S41398-020-0692-2,Symptom improvement in children with autism spectrum disorder following bumetanide administration is associated with decreased GABA/glutamate ratios.,2020-01-27,"Bumetanide has been reported to alter synaptic excitation-inhibition (E-I) balance by potentiating the action of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), thereby attenuating the severity of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in animal models. However, clinical evidence of its efficacy in young patients with ASD is limited. This was investigated in the present clinical trial of 83 patients, randomised to the bumetanide group (bumetanide treatment, 0.5 mg twice daily) or the control group (no bumetanide treatment). Primary [Children Autism Rating Scale (CARS)], secondary [Clinical Global Impressions (CGI)], and exploratory [inhibitory (γ-aminobutyric acid, GABA) and excitatory (glutamate, Glx) neurotransmitter concentrations measured in the insular cortex (IC) and visual cortex (VC) by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)] outcome measures were evaluated at baseline and at the 3-month follow-up. Side effects were monitored throughout the treatment course. Compared with the control group, the bumetanide group showed significant reduction in symptom severity, as indicated by both total CARS score and number of items assigned a score ≥ 3. The improvement in clinical symptoms was confirmed by CGI. GABA/Glx ratio in both the IC and VC decreased more rapidly over the 3-month period in the bumetanide group than that in the control group. This decrease in the IC was associated with the symptom improvement in the bumetanide group. Our study confirmed the clinical efficacy of bumetanide on alleviating the core symptoms of ASD in young children and it is the first demonstration that the improvement is associated with reduction in GABA/Glx ratios. This study suggests that the GABA/Glx ratio measured by MRS may provide a neuroimaging biomarker for assessing treatment efficacy for bumetanide.","Zhang Lingli, Huang Chu-Chung, Dai Yuan, Luo Qiang, Ji Yiting, Wang Kai, Deng Shining, Yu Juehua, Xu Mingyu, Du Xiujuan, Tang Yun, Shen Chun, Feng Jianfeng, Sahakian Barbara J, Lin Ching-Po, Li Fei",Translational psychiatry,"Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Bumetanide, Child, Child, Preschool, Glutamic Acid, Humans, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32066666,"Institute of Science and Technology for Brain-Inspired Intelligence, MOE-Key Laboratory of Computational Neuroscience and Brain-Inspired Intelligence, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.; Developmental and Behavioral Pediatric Department & Child Primary Care Department, Brain and Behavioral Research Unit of Shanghai Institute for Pediatric Research and MOE- Shanghai Key Laboratory for Children's Environmental Health, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. feili@shsmu.edu.cn.; Developmental and Behavioral Pediatric Department & Child Primary Care Department, Brain and Behavioral Research Unit of Shanghai Institute for Pediatric Research and MOE- Shanghai Key Laboratory for Children's Environmental Health, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.; Institute of Science and Technology for Brain-Inspired Intelligence, MOE-Key Laboratory of Computational Neuroscience and Brain-Inspired Intelligence, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. chingpolin@gmail.com.; Institute of Science and Technology for Brain-Inspired Intelligence, MOE-Key Laboratory of Computational Neuroscience and Brain-Inspired Intelligence, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. qluo@fudan.edu.cn."

Resting-state EEG of 82 subjects out of 92 participants (7-15 years) were available. Alpha frequency band absolute and relative power, central frequency, long-range temporal correlations, and functional E/I ratio treatment effects were related to the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) and the Social Responsiveness Scale 2 as clinical outcomes. We observed superior bumetanide effects on EEG, reflected in increased absolute and relative alpha power and functional E/I ratio and in decreased central frequency. Associations between EEG and clinical outcome change were restricted to subgroups with medium to high RBS-R improvement. Using machine learning, medium and high RBS-R improvement could be predicted by baseline RBS-R score and EEG measures with 80% and 92% accuracy, respectively.

TSC is strongly associated with broad neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder symptomatology. Preclinical TSC studies have indicated altered neuronal chloride homeostasis affecting the polarity of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) ergic transmission as a potential treatment target. Bumetanide, a selective NKCC1 chloride importer antagonist, may attenuate depolarizing GABA action, and in that way reduce disease burden. In this open-label pilot study, we tested the effect of bumetanide on a variety of neurophysiological, cognitive, and behavioral measures in children with TSC. Participants were treated with bumetanide (2dd 0.5-1.0 mg) for 13 weeks in an open-label trial. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability (ABC-I) subscale was chosen as the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included other behavioral questionnaires in addition to event-related potentials (ERP) and neuropsychological tests if tolerated. Additionally, the treatment effect on seizure frequency and quality of life was assessed. Endpoint data were collected at baseline, after 91 days of treatment and after a 28-day wash-out period. Fifteen patients (8-21-years old) with TSC were included of which 13 patients completed the study. Treatment was well-tolerated with only expected adverse events due to the diuretic effects of bumetanide. Irritable behavior (ABC-I) showed significant improvement after treatment in 11 out of 13 patients (t(12) = 4.41, p = .001, d = .773). A favorable effect was also found for social behavior (Social Responsiveness Scale) (t(11) = 4.01, p = .002, d = .549) and hyperactive behavior (ABC-hyperactivity subscale) (t(12) = 3.65, p = .003, d = .686). Moreover, patients rated their own health-related quality of life higher after treatment. At baseline, TSC patients showed several atypical ERPs versus typically developing peers of which prepulse inhibition was significantly decreased in the TSC group. Neuropsychological measurements showed no change and bumetanide had no effect on seizure frequency. The sample size and open-label design of this pilot study warrant caution when interpreting outcome measures. Bumetanide treatment is a potential treatment to alleviate the behavioral burden and quality of life associated with TSC. More elaborate trials are needed to determine the application and effect size of bumetanide for the TSC population.

Secondary objectives included evaluating the effects of buspirone on social competence, repetitive behaviors, language, sensory dysfunction, and anxiety and to assess side effects. Positron emission tomography measures of tryptophan metabolism and blood serotonin concentrations were assessed as predictors of buspirone efficacy. There was no difference in the ADOS Composite Total Score between baseline and 24 weeks among the 3 treatment groups (P = .400); however, the ADOS Restricted and Repetitive Behavior score showed a time-by-treatment effect (P = .006); the 2.5-mg buspirone group showed significant improvement (P = .003), whereas placebo and 5.0-mg buspirone groups showed no change.

Despite their prevalence and impact, there are no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed at evaluating the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for anxiolysis in this population, who may have a different biological basis for anxiety. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Secondary analyses of the STAART double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT of citalopram in children with ASD examined whether citalopram reduced anxiety measured on the parent-reported Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory-4 (CASI-4) as the primary outcome. An intention-to-treat analysis involving all 149 participants used multiple imputations for missing data and included baseline stratification factors of age group and site, among others. We prespecified as clinically significant a 33% reduction in anxiety in citalopram versus placebo, coinciding with 80% power. We tested whether communicative ability on the Vineland Communication score moderated treatment effect and explored whether initial anxiety was associated with greater adverse events, which could impact on dose titration and achieving optimal dose. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Both groups showed substantial reduction in anxiety. Citalopram was associated with a nonsignificant 16.5% greater reduction (observed coefficient = -0.181, bootstrap standard error = 0.126, <i>p</i> = 0.151, confidence interval = -0.428 to 0.066). Anxiety reports were significantly lower in children with reduced communicative ability, but communicative ability did not moderate the treatment effect (interaction <i>p</i> = 0.294). Initial anxiety levels were not associated with increased adverse effects (interaction <i>p</i>s 0.162-0.954). <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Citalopram did not statistically significantly improve anxiety in children with ASD. Clinicians should be cautious in their use of SSRIs for this indication. There remains a need for well-powered clinical trials testing the efficacy of SSRIs among autistic children with anxiety disorders.","Simonoff Emily, Mowlem Florence, Pearson Oliver, Anagnostou Evdokia, Donnelly Craig, Hollander Eric, King Bryan H, McCracken James T, Scahill Lawrence, Sikich Linmarie, Pickles Andrew",Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology,"Adolescent, Anxiety, Anxiety Disorders, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Citalopram, Humans, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35501967,"Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA.; Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Duke Center for Autism and Brain Development, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.; Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience and Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.; Department of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry and Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience and Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.; Department of Psychiatry, Weill Institute for Neurosciences, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, Marcus Autism Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.; Autism and Obsessive Compulsive Spectrum Program, Psychiatric Research Institute of Montefiore Einstein, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA.; Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital, Toronto, Canada."

To identify possible nonspecific, baseline predictors of response to intervention in a large randomized clinical trial of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders. Randomized clinical trial of citalopram hydrobromide for children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders and prominent repetitive behavior. Baseline data at study entry were examined with respect to final outcome to determine if response predictors could be identified. A total of 149 children and adolescents 5 to 17 years of age (mean [SD] age, 9.4 [3.1] years) from 6 academic centers were randomly assigned to citalopram (n = 73) or placebo (n = 76). Participants had autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome, or pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified; had illness severity ratings that were moderate or more than moderate on the Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale; and scored moderate or more than moderate on compulsive behaviors measured with the modified Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. Twelve weeks of treatment with citalopram (10 mg/5 mL) or placebo. The mean (SD) maximum dose of citalopram was 16.5 (6.5) mg by mouth daily (maximum dose, 20 mg/d). A positive response was defined as having a score of at least much improved on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale at week 12. Baseline measures included demographic (sex, age, weight, and pubertal status), clinical, and family measures. Clinical variables included baseline illness severity ratings (the Aberrant Behavior Checklist, the Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised, and the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale). Family measures included the Caregiver Strain Questionnaire. Several baseline predictors of response were identified, and a principal component analysis yielded 3 composite measures (disruptive behavior, autism/mood, and caregiver strain) that significantly predicted response at week 12. Specifically, participants in the placebo group were significantly less likely than participants in the citalopram group to respond at week 12 if they entered the study more symptomatic on each of the 3 composite measures, and they were at least 2 times less likely to be responders. This analysis suggests strategies that may be useful in anticipating and potentially mitigating the nonspecific response in randomized clinical trials of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00086645.","King Bryan H, Dukes Kimberly, Donnelly Craig L, Sikich Linmarie, McCracken James T, Scahill Lawrence, Hollander Eric, Bregman Joel D, Anagnostou Evdokia, Robinson Fay, Sullivan Lisa, Hirtz Deborah",JAMA pediatrics,"Adolescent, Asperger Syndrome, Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Child, Preschool, Citalopram, Female, Humans, Male, Placebo Effect, Principal Component Analysis, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24061784,"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle2Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Medicine, Seattle Children's Hospital, Washington."

A retrospective pilot study was conducted to determine whether divalproex sodium was effective in treating core dimensions and associated features of autism. Fourteen patients who met DSM-IV criteria for autism, Asperger's disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, both with and without a history of seizure disorders or EEG abnormalities, were openly treated with divalproex sodium. Improvement was assessed via the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale.

Sixteen outpatients meeting Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders criteria for borderline personality disorder were randomly assigned to receive placebo (N = 4) or divalproex sodium (N = 12). Change was assessed in global symptom severity (Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement Scale [CGI-I]) and functioning (Global Assessment Scale [GAS]) as well as in specific core symptoms (depression, aggression, irritability, and suicidality). There was significant improvement from baseline in both global measures (CGI-I and GAS) following divalproex sodium treatment. A high dropout rate precluded finding significant differences between the treatment groups in the intent-to-treat analyses, although all results were in the predicted direction. Treatment with divalproex sodium may be more effective than placebo for global symptomatology, level of functioning, aggression, and depression.

7592502,,An open trial of valproate in borderline personality disorder.,1995-11-01,"Target symptoms in pharmacotherapy of borderline personality disorder include mood instability, anxiety, and impulsivity. Valproate appears useful for the treatment of these target symptoms in several disorders, and carbamazepine has been found effective for such symptoms in borderline personality disorder. We therefore conducted a preliminary open-label trial of valproate in borderline personality disorder. Eleven patients who met DSM-III-R criteria for borderline personality disorder were entered into an 8-week study of valproate. Exclusion criteria included current major depression or major medical disorder. All patients were in psychotherapy at least once a week for a minimum of 8 weeks prior to starting medication. Valproate was increased as tolerated to reach blood levels of 50 to 100 micrograms/mL. Clinician- and self-rated scales were completed each week. Three patients did not complete the study. Of completers, 4 of 8 patients were responders (""much less"" or ""less"") on clinician-rated change scores for overall pathology and for mood. Three of 8 patients were responders on change scores for anxiety, anger, impulsivity, and rejection sensitivity. There was a significant (p = .03) decrease in total Symptom Checklist-90 scores between the start and end of the trial. On the Overt Aggression Scale (Modified), total other-directed assault did not significantly decrease, but there was a significant (p = .02) decrease in global subjective irritability. Valproate led to overall improvement in 50% of a small sample of borderline personality disorder patients who completed an 8-week open trial. The medication was modestly helpful for mood and irritability as well as for anxiety, anger, rejection sensitivity, and impulsivity, but specific therapeutic effects varied from patient to patient. More extensive controlled trials of anticonvulsants for impulsive personality disorders are warranted.","Stein D J, Simeon D, Frenkel M, Islam M N, Hollander E",The Journal of clinical psychiatry,"Adult, Ambulatory Care, Borderline Personality Disorder, Drug Administration Schedule, Female, Humans, Male, Personality Inventory, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Treatment Outcome, Valproic Acid",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7592502,"Department of Psychiatry, University of Stellenbosch, Tygerberg, South Africa."

The goal of this study was to assess the tolerability, safety, and efficacy of donepezil on EF in a sample of children and adolescents with ASD. Thirty-four children and adolescents with ASD (age range 8-17 years; IQ >75) were enrolled in a 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of donepezil (doses of 5 and 10 mg), followed by a 10-week open label trial for placebo nonresponders. The effect of donepezil treatment on EF was examined. Despite improvement on a number of EF measures, no statistically significant between-group differences were found (with gains observed for both the placebo and donepezil groups).

A 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a 12-week, open-label extension was conducted. The intervention consisted of donepezil (5-10 mg/day) in young adults (aged 18-35 years) with DS, but no AD. The primary measure was the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) test and secondary measures were the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS), the Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test for Children, and the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals, Third Edition. At baseline, 123 subjects were randomly assigned treatment with donepezil or placebo. During the double-blind phase, SIB scores improved significantly from baseline in both groups, with no significant between-group differences. During the open-label phase, SIB scores in the original donepezil group remained stable; the original placebo group showed an improvement similar to that seen in the double-blind phase. VABS scores improved for donepezil, but not placebo, during the double-blind phase (observed cases, P = 0.03; last observation carried forward, P = 0.07). Post hoc responder analyses were significant for donepezil using three of five response definitions (P < or = 0.045). Adverse event rates were comparable to AD studies. In this first large-scale, multicenter trial of a pharmacological agent for DS, donepezil appears safe. Efficacy interpretation was limited for the primary measure due to apparent learning/practice and ceiling effects. Outcomes in post hoc analyses suggested efficacy in some, but not all subjects, consistent with phenotypic variability of DS.

Both biochemical and clinical outcomes were examined. Biochemically, FEN led to an increase in dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and decreases in whole-blood serotonin (5-HT), plasma norepinephrine (NE), and plasma 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG). The decrease in whole-blood 5-HT was seen only during treatment with FEN. However, NE levels did not return to baseline as long as 8 weeks after the first FEN treatment period. Increases in DOPAC were greater during the second FEN treatment period than the first. Persistent changes in catecholamine regulation may be related to previously reported long-term effects on central nervous system 5-HT after FEN. Clinically, FEN led to a modest decrease in parent, but not teacher, ratings of hyperactivity and to a small reduction in sensorimotor abnormalities. Abnormal social and affectual responses also decreased, but this was not directly related to FEN treatment. Effects on cognition were equivocal.

Clinical improvement was observed in 6 children (responders). It included reduction of behavioral symptoms such as motor activity, anxiety, mood disturbances, and distractibility. Modifications of serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and DA metabolites [homovanillic acid (HVA) and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC)] were assessed at urinary levels. Responders and nonresponders showed a significant decrease of urinary 5-HT levels on fenfluramine. The main differences between the two groups of subjects were found with HVA, the major metabolite of DA. Fenfluramine significantly increased HVA levels in responders whereas no significant modification was found in nonresponders. Moreover the initial level of HVA (lower in responders) significantly differentiated the two groups. These results suggest that the clinical response to fenfluramine could be related to the dopaminergic action of this drug and that urinary DA metabolite levels could be considered as indicators of the responsiveness to fenfluramine treatment in children with autistic behavior.","Barthelemy C, Bruneau N, Jouve J, Martineau J, Muh J P, Lelord G",Journal of autism and developmental disorders,"3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic Acid, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Dopamine, Double-Blind Method, Female, Fenfluramine, Homovanillic Acid, Humans, Male, Serotonin",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2745390,"Explorations Fonctionnelles Psychopathologiques, C.H.U.

Repetitive behaviors were measured with the compulsion subscale of the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale; the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) improvement scale was used to rate improvement in obsessive-compulsive symptoms and overall severity. There was a significant treatment-by-time interaction indicating a significantly greater reduction in repetitive behaviors across time for fluoxetine than for placebo.

Low-dose liquid fluoxetine (mean final dose: 9.9+/-4.35 mg/day) was superior to placebo in the treatment of repetitive behaviors by CY-BOCS compulsion scale. The effect size was in the moderate to large range, and the doses used were low. Liquid fluoxetine was only slightly, and not significantly, superior to placebo on CGI autism score partially due to a phase order effect. However, fluoxetine was marginally superior to placebo on a composite measure of global effectiveness. Liquid fluoxetine did not significantly differ from placebo on treatment emergent side effects. Liquid fluoxetine in low doses is more effective than placebo in the treatment of repetitive behaviors in childhood autism.

Serotonin agonists modulate motor response inhibition and have shown positive behavioural effects in both disorders. We therefore used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the so far unknown shared and disorder-specific inhibitory brain dysfunctions in these two disorders, as well as the effects of a single dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. Age-matched boys with ADHD (18), ASD (19) and healthy controls (25) were compared with fMRI during a stop task measuring motor inhibition. Patients were scanned twice, under either an acute dose of fluoxetine or placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised design. Repeated measures analyses within patients assessed drug effects. To test for potential normalisation effects of brain dysfunctions, patients under each drug condition were compared to controls. Under placebo, relative to controls, ASD boys showed overactivation in left and right inferior frontal cortex (IFC), while ADHD boys showed disorder-specific underactivation in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and basal ganglia. Under fluoxetine, the prefrontal dysfunctions were no longer observed, due to inverse effects of fluoxetine on these activations: fluoxetine downregulated IFC and OFC activation in ASD but upregulated them in ADHD. The findings show that fluoxetine normalises frontal lobe dysfunctions in both disorders via inverse effects, downregulating abnormally increased frontal activation in ASD and upregulating abnormally decreased frontal activation in ADHD, potentially reflecting inverse baseline serotonin levels in both disorders.","Chantiluke Kaylita, Barrett Nadia, Giampietro Vincent, Santosh Paramala, Brammer Michael, Simmons Andrew, Murphy Declan G, Rubia Katya",Psychopharmacology,"Adolescent, Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation, Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Basal Ganglia, Child, Double-Blind Method, Fluoxetine, Frontal Lobe, Humans, Inhibition, Psychological, Intelligence, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Movement, Prefrontal Cortex, Psychomotor Performance",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25533997,"Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry/MRC Center for Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry (SGDP), Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, 16 De Crespigny Park, PO46, London, SE5 8AF, UK."

Fluvoxamine and MPH-ER were given to the study group, while fluvoxamine and placebo were given to the control group, with 8 weeks of the treatment course. Y-BOCS, Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) were used to assess the efficacy, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to evaluate the sleep quality, and Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS) was used to evaluate the side effects. Data were analyzed in the intention-to-treat sample. Results: The improvement in the Y-BOCS total score, Y-BOCS obsession subscale score and HAMA score were more prominent in the study group than those in the control group (P<0.001). There was no significant difference in PSQI score and TESS score between the two groups. MPH-ER was well tolerated. Conclusion: Fluvoxamine combined with MPH-ER is effective in the treatment of refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder. It can improve anxiety and has no adverse effect on sleep quality.","Zheng Huirong, Jia Fujun, Guo Guangquan, Quan Dongming, Li Gang, Huang Huiyan",Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

Forty-eight children (mean age 7 years 4  months; 82% male) with ASD and language impairment were randomized to receive 12 weeks of high-dose folinic acid (2 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> per day, maximum 50 mg per day; n=23) or placebo (n=25). Children were subtyped by glutathione and folate receptor-α autoantibody (FRAA) status. Improvement in verbal communication, as measured by a ability-appropriate standardized instrument, was significantly greater in participants receiving folinic acid as compared with those receiving placebo, resulting in an effect of 5.7 (1.0,10.4) standardized points with a medium-to-large effect size (Cohen's d=0.70). FRAA status was predictive of response to treatment. For FRAA-positive participants, improvement in verbal communication was significantly greater in those receiving folinic acid as compared with those receiving placebo, resulting in an effect of 7.3 (1.4,13.2) standardized points with a large effect size (Cohen's d=0.91), indicating that folinic acid treatment may be more efficacious in children with ASD who are FRAA positive. Improvements in subscales of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, the Aberrant Behavior Checklist, the Autism Symptom Questionnaire and the Behavioral Assessment System for Children were significantly greater in the folinic acid group as compared with the placebo group. There was no significant difference in adverse effects between treatment groups. Thus, in this small trial of children with non-syndromic ASD and language impairment, treatment with high-dose folinic acid for 12 weeks resulted in improvement in verbal communication as compared with placebo, particularly in those participants who were positive for FRAAs.","Frye R E, Slattery J, Delhey L, Furgerson B, Strickland T, Tippett M, Sailey A, Wynne R, Rose S, Melnyk S, Jill James S, Sequeira J M, Quadros E V",Molecular psychiatry,"Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Child, Preschool, Double-Blind Method, Female, Folate Receptor 1, Humans, Language Development Disorders, Language Disorders, Leucovorin, Male, Placebo Effect, Receptors, Peptide, Treatment Outcome, Verbal Behavior",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27752075,"Arkansas Children's Hospital, Little Rock, AR, USA.; Arkansas Children's Research Institute, Little Rock, AR, USA.; Department of Medicine, State University of New York - Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA."

Medications are often needed to reduce agitation, but it is unclear what the desired level of sedation is. This study assessed personalized sedation goals (PSGs) and their predictors for patients in a delirium clinical trial and in clinical vignettes. This was a preplanned secondary analysis of a double-blind randomized clinical trial examining the sedative effect of chlorpromazine and/or haloperidol in patients with agitated delirium. At the baseline, caregivers and nurses were independently asked to select the PSG for the trial patient from 5 choices corresponding to Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) scores of 0 or higher (no sedation), -1 to -2, -3, -4, and -5 (deep sedation). Respondents also selected a PSG for 6 vignettes that differed by the level of agitation, ability to communicate, and survival. Forty-two caregivers and 39 nurses answered questions regarding PSGs. For the trial patient, caregivers preferred RASS scores of -1 to -2 most often (36%), whereas nurses preferred an RASS score of -3 most often (51 %). Caregivers were significantly more likely than nurses to choose lighter sedation (odds ratio [OR], 4.8; P = .01) despite reporting greater delirium-related distress (P = .0006). Patients were undersedated 33% to 53% of the time and oversedated 0% to 15% of the time according to the PSG response criteria. In the case vignettes, deeper sedation was preferred by nurses (P < .0001) and for patients who were unable to communicate (OR, 3.1-4.4; P < .0001) and had a shorter life expectancy (OR, 1.7; P = .002). Caregivers often preferred lighter sedation than nurses. Many patients were undersedated in comparison with caregivers' PSGs, and this highlights room for improvement. In the last days of life, many patients with cancer develop delirium and become restless/agitated; this can be highly distressing. Caregivers and physicians alike are often concerned about the use of sedatives for agitated delirium and try to find a balance between maximizing comfort and maintaining communication. This study examined the concept of a personalized sedation goal for setting an individualized target for the level of sedation. Caregivers often preferred lighter sedation than nurses.

Permuted block randomisation (block size six; 1:1:1) was done, stratified by baseline Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) scores. Research staff, clinicians, patients, and caregivers were masked to group assignment. The primary outcome was change in RASS score from time 0 to 24 h. Comparisons among group were done by modified intention-to-treat analysis. This completed study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03021486. Between July 5, 2017, and July 1, 2019, 998 patients were screened for eligibility, with 68 being enrolled and randomly assigned to treatment; 45 received the masked study interventions (escalation n=15, rotation n=16, combination n=14). RASS score decreased significantly within 30 min and remained low at 24 h in the escalation group (n=10, mean RASS score change between 0 h and 24 h -3·6 [95% CI -5·0 to -2·2]), rotation group (n=11, -3·3 [-4·4 to -2·2]), and combination group (n=10, -3·0 [-4·6 to -1·4]), with no difference among groups (p=0·71). The most common serious toxicity was hypotension (escalation n=6 [40%], rotation n=5 [31%], combination n=3 [21%]); there were no treatment-related deaths. Our data provide preliminary evidence that the three strategies of neuroleptics might reduce agitation in patients with terminal agitation. These findings are in the context of the single-centre design, small sample size, and lack of a placebo-only group.

29469951,10.1002/Cncr.31312,The minimal clinically important difference of the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale in patients with cancer with agitated delirium.,2018-05-15,"The Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) is commonly used to assess psychomotor activity; however, to the authors' knowledge, its minimal clinically important difference (MCID) has not been determined to date. The objective of the current study was to identify the MCID for RASS using 2 anchor-based approaches. The current study was a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial to compare the effect of lorazepam versus placebo as an adjuvant to haloperidol for persistent agitation in patients with delirium. The primary outcome was change in RASS (10-point numeric rating scale ranging from -5 [unarousable] to +4 [combative]) from baseline to 8 hours after treatment administration. The sensitivity-specificity and within-patient change methods were used to identify the MCID, with the anchor being patient comfort after the study intervention as perceived by caregivers and nurses. A total of 90 patients were randomized and 58 (64%) received the study medication for restlessness/agitation (mean baseline RASS, 1.6). A total of 23 caregivers (61%) and 23 nurses (55%) perceived that the patient was more comfortable after treatment. Using the sensitivity-specificity method, the optimal RASS reduction was ≥4 points according to both caregivers (sensitivity of 61% and specificity of 80%; area under the curve, 0.71) and nurses (sensitivity of 73% and specificity of 84%; area under the curve, 0.78). The RASS cutoff value based on the within-patient change method was similar (-4.2 for caregivers and -4.0 for nurses). For patients with persistent restlessness/agitation, a reduction of ≥4 points in RASS was considered to be the MCID for both nurses and caregivers. These preliminary findings may have implications for sample size calculation and the interpretation of treatment effect in future delirium trials.

To compare the effect of lorazepam vs placebo as an adjuvant to haloperidol for persistent agitation in patients with delirium in the setting of advanced cancer. Single-center, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial conducted at an acute palliative care unit at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, enrolling 93 patients with advanced cancer and agitated delirium despite scheduled haloperidol from February 11, 2014, to June 30, 2016, with data collection completed in October 2016. Lorazepam (3 mg) intravenously (n = 47) or placebo (n = 43) in addition to haloperidol (2 mg) intravenously upon the onset of an agitation episode. The primary outcome was change in Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) score (range, -5 [unarousable] to 4 [very agitated or combative]) from baseline to 8 hours after treatment administration. Secondary end points were rescue neuroleptic use, delirium recall, comfort (perceived by caregivers and nurses), communication capacity, delirium severity, adverse effects, discharge outcomes, and overall survival. Among 90 randomized patients (mean age, 62 years; women, 42 [47%]), 58 (64%) received the study medication and 52 (90%) completed the trial. Lorazepam + haloperidol resulted in a significantly greater reduction of RASS score at 8 hours (-4.1 points) than placebo + haloperidol (-2.3 points) (mean difference, -1.9 points [95% CI, -2.8 to -0.9]; P < .001). The lorazepam + haloperidol group required less median rescue neuroleptics (2.0 mg) than the placebo + haloperidol group (4.0 mg) (median difference, -1.0 mg [95% CI, -2.0 to 0]; P = .009) and was perceived to be more comfortable by both blinded caregivers and nurses (caregivers: 84% for the lorazepam + haloperidol group vs 37% for the placebo + haloperidol group; mean difference, 47% [95% CI, 14% to 73%], P = .007; nurses: 77% for the lorazepam + haloperidol group vs 30% for the placebo + haloperidol group; mean difference, 47% [95% CI, 17% to 71%], P = .005). No significant between-group differences were found in delirium-related distress and survival. The most common adverse effect was hypokinesia (3 patients in the lorazepam + haloperidol group [19%] and 4 patients in the placebo + haloperidol group [27%]). In this preliminary trial of hospitalized patients with agitated delirium in the setting of advanced cancer, the addition of lorazepam to haloperidol compared with haloperidol alone resulted in a significantly greater reduction in agitation at 8 hours.

Management includes analgesics and antiemetics, but symptoms are often refractory. Haloperidol has been utilized in the palliative care setting for similar symptoms. The study objective was to determine whether haloperidol as an adjunct to conventional therapy would improve symptoms in gastroparesis patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adult ED patients with acute exacerbation of previously diagnosed gastroparesis. The treatment group received 5 mg of haloperidol plus conventional therapy (determined by the treating physician). The control group received a placebo plus conventional therapy. The severity of each subject's abdominal pain and nausea were assessed before intervention and every 15 minutes thereafter for 1 hour using a 10-point scale for pain and a 5-point scale for nausea. Primary outcomes were decreased pain and nausea 1 hour after treatment. Of the 33 study patients, 15 were randomized to receive haloperidol. Before treatment, the mean intensity of pain was 8.5 in the haloperidol group and 8.28 in the placebo group; mean pretreatment nausea scores were 4.53 and 4.11, respectively. One hour after therapy, the mean pain and nausea scores in the haloperidol group were 3.13 and 1.83 compared to 7.17 and 3.39 in the placebo group. The reduction in mean pain intensity therapy was 5.37 in the haloperidol group (p ≤ 0.001) compared to 1.11 in the placebo group (p = 0.11). The reduction in mean nausea score was 2.70 in the haloperidol group (p ≤ 0.001) and 0.72 in the placebo group (p = 0.05).

Patients were randomly assigned to receive haloperidol or ziprasidone or placebo every 6 hrs for up to 14 days. Twice each day, frequency of study drug administration was adjusted according to delirium status, level of sedation, and side effects. The primary end point was the number of days patients were alive without delirium or coma. During the 21-day study period, patients in the haloperidol group spent a similar number days alive without delirium or coma (median [interquartile range], 14.0 [6.0-18.0] days) as did patients in the ziprasidone (15.0 [9.1-18.0] days) and placebo groups (12.5 [1.2-17.2] days; p = 0.66).

Prognosis is poor, in part, because existing medications target only associated ASD features. Emerging evidence suggests that the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) may be a blood-based biomarker of social functioning and a possible treatment for ASD. However, prior OXT treatment trials have produced equivocal results, perhaps because of variability in patients' underlying neuropeptide biology, but this hypothesis has not been tested. Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design, we tested the efficacy and tolerability of 4-wk intranasal OXT treatment (24 International Units, twice daily) in 32 children with ASD, aged 6-12 y. When pretreatment neuropeptide measures were included in the statistical model, OXT compared with placebo treatment significantly enhanced social abilities in children with ASD [as measured by the trial's primary outcome measure, the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS)]. Importantly, pretreatment blood OXT concentrations also predicted treatment response, such that individuals with the lowest pretreatment OXT concentrations showed the greatest social improvement. OXT was well tolerated, and its effects were specific to social functioning, with no observed decrease in repetitive behaviors or anxiety. Finally, as with many trials, some placebo-treated participants showed improvement on the SRS. This enhanced social functioning was mirrored by a posttreatment increase in their blood OXT concentrations, suggesting that increased endogenous OXT secretion may underlie this improvement. These findings indicate that OXT treatment enhances social abilities in children with ASD and that individuals with pretreatment OXT signaling deficits may stand to benefit the most from OXT treatment.","Parker Karen J, Oztan Ozge, Libove Robin A, Sumiyoshi Raena D, Jackson Lisa P, Karhson Debra S, Summers Jacqueline E, Hinman Kyle E, Motonaga Kara S, Phillips Jennifer M, Carson Dean S, Garner Joseph P, Hardan Antonio Y",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"Administration, Inhalation, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Female, Humans, Male, Oxytocics, Oxytocin, Social Skills",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28696286,"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.; Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305; kjparker@stanford.edu."

Individuals with FXS, males in particular, often exhibit extreme eye gaze avoidance and hyperarousal when they encounter stressful social situations. We investigated whether oxytocin (OT), a hormone with prosocial and anxiolytic effects, could alleviate symptoms of social anxiety in this population. A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled single-dose trial was performed with intranasal administration of placebo, 24 IU OT and 48 IU OT. Measures of eye gaze frequency, heart rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), heart rate variability (HRV) and salivary cortisol were obtained during a structured social challenge conducted 50 min following OT administration. Ten low-functioning males with FXS (aged 13-28 years) traveled to Stanford for the initial visit: 8 completed the study. Eye gaze frequency improved significantly in response to the 24 IU OT dose and salivary cortisol levels decreased significantly in response to the 48 IU OT dose. There was no effect of OT on heart rate, RSA or HRV although individual plots of the heart rate data suggested that OT increased heart rate in some participants and decreased heart rate in others.

Specific manic symptoms were found to be linked to sleep disturbance (characterized as a ""bridge"" symptom), which in turn linked the manic and depressive symptom clusters. The presence (vs. absence) of the specific manic symptoms we identified moderated the antidepressant and antimanic effects of lurasidone in the treatment of MDD with mixed (subthreshold hypomanic) features.","Goldberg Joseph F, Siu Cynthia, Mao Yongcai, Tsai Joyce, Pikalov Andrei, Calabrese Joseph R, Loebel Antony",Journal of affective disorders,"Antipsychotic Agents, Bipolar Disorder, Depressive Disorder, Major, Double-Blind Method, Humans, Lurasidone Hydrochloride, Prospective Studies, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33065813,"Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.

Treatment with some commonly used antipsychotic medications may increase the risk of developing metabolic syndrome. The aim of the study was to evaluate the safety of lurasidone in patients who continued lurasidone or switched from risperidone to lurasidone. A secondary aim was assessment of the effect of long-term lurasidone on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The treatment sample in the current study consisted of clinically stable patients with schizophrenia (N = 223) who had completed a 12-month, double-blind study of lurasidone vs. risperidone. In the current extension study, all patients received 6 months of open-label treatment with lurasidone, either continuing lurasidone assigned during the preceding double-blind trial, or switching from double-blind risperidone to lurasidone. Safety and tolerability parameters included body weight, prolactin, and metabolic laboratory tests. Six months of OL treatment with lurasidone was generally well-tolerated, with a low incidence of parkinsonism (4.5%) and akathisia (3.1%). Overall, few adverse events were rated as severe (4.9%), and discontinuation due to an adverse event was low in the lurasidone continuation vs. risperidone switch groups (3.7% vs. 6.9%). In the lurasidone continuation versus risperidone switch groups, change from OL baseline to 6-month endpoint (observed case) was observed in mean body weight (- 0.6 vs. -2.6 kg), median total cholesterol (- 4.0 vs. + 4.5 mg/dL), triglycerides (- 4.5 vs. -5.5 mg/dL), glucose (0.0 vs. -3.0 mg/dL) and prolactin (males, + 0.15 vs. -11.2 ng/mL; females, + 1.3 vs. -30.8 ng/mL). Improvement in PANSS total score was maintained, from OL baseline to endpoint in the continuation vs. switch groups (+ 1.0 vs. -1.0; OC). In this 6-month extension study, lurasidone treatment was generally well-tolerated and associated with minimal effects on weight, metabolic parameters, and prolactin levels. Patients who switched from risperidone to lurasidone experienced reductions in weight, metabolic parameters and prolactin levels commensurate with increases in these safety parameters experienced during the previous 12 months of treatment with risperidone.

Patients 10-17 years of age with a DSM-5 diagnosis of bipolar I depression were randomized to 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with flexibly dosed lurasidone (20-80 mg/day) (n = 173) or placebo (n = 170). The primary efficacy measure was change from baseline to week 6 in the Children's Depression Rating Scale, Revised (CDRS-R). Treatment response was defined as 50% or greater improvement on the CDRS-R from baseline to week 6. Cognitive function was evaluated with the computerized Brief Cogstate Battery at baseline and week 6. Analyses were adjusted for baseline BMI, as well as age. HsCRP was evaluated as a logarithmically transformed continuous variable and as a categorical variable dichotomized into lower (<1 mg/L) and higher (≥1 mg/L) subgroups. A significant interaction was found between baseline hsCRP and treatment group for change in CDRS-R score at study endpoint, with larger placebo-corrected effect sizes for lurasidone in the higher baseline hsCRP group (≥1 mg/L). A significant BMI-by-hsCRP-by-treatment interaction was found for response rate with higher baseline hsCRP levels associated with greater antidepressant response to lurasidone (vs. placebo) in the normal BMI range subgroup (NNT = 2 in higher hsCRP vs. NNT = 5 in lower hsCRP groups) but not in the overweight/obese patients (NNT = 6 in higher hsCRP vs. NNT = 5 in lower hsCRP). Similarly, a significant interaction effect was observed for the combination of hsCRP and BMI on the procognitive effect of lurasidone, with higher baseline hsCRP levels being associated with improvement in cognitive function for lurasidone (vs placebo) in the normal BMI range subgroup but not in overweight/obese patients. These results suggest that young patients with bipolar depression with normal weight and higher levels of pre-treatment CRP may show a greater placebo-adjusted improvement in depressive symptoms and cognitive performance when treated with lurasidone. If these findings are confirmed in future prospective studies, CRP and BMI may prove to be useful diagnostic and predictive biomarkers in the treatment with lurasidone of children and adolescents with bipolar depression.","Raison Charles L, Siu Cynthia, Pikalov Andrei, Tocco Michael, Loebel Antony","Brain, behavior, and immunity","Adolescent, Antipsychotic Agents, Bipolar Disorder, Body Mass Index, C-Reactive Protein, Child, Depression, Double-Blind Method, Humans, Lurasidone Hydrochloride, Prospective Studies, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31857217,"Department of Human Development and Family Studies, School of Human Ecology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1300 Linden Drive, Madison, WI 53706, USA; Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 6001 Research Park Blvd, Madison, WI 53719, USA.

Patients meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for MDD, who presented with 2 or 3 protocol-specified manic symptoms, were randomized to 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with flexible doses of either lurasidone 20-60 mg/d (n = 109) or placebo (n = 100). The study was conducted between September 2011 and October 2014. Change in sexual functioning was assessed utilizing the 14-item self-report Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire (CSFQ-14) administered at baseline and week 6 endpoint. Change from baseline to week 6 in depression severity was assessed utilizing the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. Lurasidone significantly reduced mean MADRS total scores at week 6 endpoint (-20.5 vs -13.0; P < .001). Treatment with lurasidone was associated with significant endpoint improvement in CSFQ total scores versus placebo (+5.1 vs +3.1; P < .05). Fewer patients treated with lurasidone versus placebo shifted from normal to abnormal sexual function. The proportion of patients with a baseline-to-endpoint shift from normal to abnormal sexual function was smaller for lurasidone versus placebo (1.9% vs 4.3%; CSFQ criteria) at study endpoint. Use of higher lurasidone doses was not associated with greater impairment in sexual functioning. No treatment-emergent adverse events related to sexual function were reported during lurasidone treatment. In this secondary analysis of a placebo-controlled trial involving patients with MDD and mixed features, lurasidone was not associated with treatment-related sexual dysfunction.

Site-based Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) interviews were paired with 184 site-independent ratings derived from audio-digital recordings. The paired MADRS and YMRS scores were highly correlated (r = 0.708 and 0.885, respectively) and generated minimal scoring discordance. The surveillance program identified 14 MADRS scores (7.6% of this sample) that were below the study entry criterion (MADRS ≥26) and resulted in screen failure. When present, paired scoring discordance was associated with symptom severity, interview length, interview quality, and the level of patient cooperation. Higher severity scores (MADRS ≥40 and YMRS ≥15) were associated with greater paired scoring discordance. Further, MADRS scores <30 and short MADRS interviews conducted in ≤12 min revealed significantly more pairs of discordant outliers (p = 0.04 and 0.009, respectively). The findings suggest that MDD patients with mixed features can be reliably assessed, that paired site-based and site-independent assessments were generally concordant, and that ratings surveillance may reinforce ratings precision.","Targum Steven D, Pendergrass J Cara, Lee Sang, Loebel Antony",International journal of methods in psychiatric research,"Adult, Antipsychotic Agents, Bipolar Disorder, Depressive Disorder, Major, Double-Blind Method, Humans, Interview, Psychological, Lurasidone Hydrochloride, Outcome Assessment, Health Care, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Reproducibility of Results, Severity of Illness Index",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29943445,"Bracket Global, LLC, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, Fort Lee, New Jersey, USA."

Patient-level data were pooled from five 6-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of fixed-dose, once-daily, oral lurasidone (40, 80, 120, or 160 mg/d). Agitation was assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Excited Component (PANSS-EC) score, utilizing a mixed model for repeated measurement analysis. In patients with higher levels of agitation at baseline (PANSS-EC score≥14; n=773), lurasidone was associated with significantly greater improvement in least-squares (LS) mean PANSS-EC scores versus placebo at Day 3/4 (-1.6 vs -1.0; p<0.05), Day 7 (-2.3 vs -1.6; p<0.05), and at Week 6 endpoint (-5.5 vs -3.8; p<0.001; effect size=0.43). In patients with lower agitation at baseline (PANSS-EC score<14; n=754), LS mean PANSS-EC score change was significantly greater for lurasidone compared with placebo at Day 7 (-0.8 vs -0.1; p<0. 01) through Week 6 endpoint (-1.9 vs -0.9; p<0.001; effect size=0.31). Higher doses of lurasidone were notably more effective than lower doses in patients with more severe agitation at study baseline. In this pooled analysis of 5 short-term studies, lurasidone provided early and sustained reduction in agitation, assessed using the PANSS-EC score, in patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia.

Mecamylamine, because of its safety record in children with other disorders, was chosen for this first exploration. Twenty children with autism spectrum disorder age 4-12 years were randomly assigned for 14 weeks to placebo (n=8) or mecamylamine (n=12) in ascending fixed doses: 0.5 mg/day for 6 weeks, 2.5 mg for 2 weeks, then 5 mg/day for 6 weeks. Improvement was rated by a blinded independent evaluator. Because of small sample, data analysis was descriptive. Eighteen participants (10 mecamylamine, 8 placebo) completed the study. All doses were well tolerated; the only side effect of note was constipation (50% compared with 25% of placebo group). Three children had clinically nonsignificant electrocardiographic QT prolongation. Both groups showed modest to moderate improvement, but differences between groups were negligible. On the primary outcome measure, the Ohio Autism Clinical Impressions Scale, 90% of the active treatment group showed improvement at some point (but only 40% sustained it), compared with 62% on placebo.

Graphed means suggested better outcome with lower mg/kg and longer medication duration. Four parents spontaneously reported reduced hyperactivity and irritability and better verbalization and continued mecamylamine at their own expense.

SOL recorded with the electronic sleep diary shortened significantly (mean ± standard deviation [SD], - 36.7 ± 46.1 min; 95% confidence interval [CI], - 45.9 to - 27.5; P <  0.0001) in the medication phase I from baseline, and the SOL-shortening effect of melatonin persisted in the medication phase II and the follow-up phase. Temper upon wakening and sleepiness after awakening improved significantly (P <  0.0001 each) in the medication phase I from baseline and persisted in the follow-up phase. The following subscales of the ABC-J improved significantly: stereotypic behavior (P = 0.0322) in the medication phase I; and irritability, hyperactivity, and inappropriate speech (P <  0.0001) in the medication phase II. Treatment-emergent adverse events did not occur subsequent to week 16 after medication onset, and NDDs did not deteriorate in the follow-up phase. Long-term melatonin treatment in combination with adequate sleep hygiene interventions may afford clinical benefits to children with NDDs and potentially elevates their well-being.

It is also associated with ritualistic and stereotypical behaviour. Recent studies propose both hyper-and hypoglutamatergic ideologies for autism. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of memantine plus risperidone in the treatment of children with autism. Children with autism were randomly allocated to risperidone plus memantine or placebo plus risperidone for a 10-wk, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The dose of risperidone was titrated up to 3 mg/d and memantine was titrated to 20 mg/d. Children were assessed at baseline and after 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 wk of starting medication protocol. The primary outcome measure was the irritability subscale of Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C). Difference between the two treatment arms was significant as the group that received memantine had greater reduction in ABC-C subscale scores for irritability, stereotypic behaviour and hyperactivity. Eight side-effects were observed over the trial, out of the 25 side-effects that the checklist included. The difference between the two groups in the frequency of side-effects was not significant. The present study suggests that memantine may be a potential adjunctive treatment strategy for autism and it was generally well tolerated.

At the 0.60-mg/kg MPH dose, more children showed substantial cognitive and behavioral gains than those who showed substantial declines in a ratio of more than 5:1. However, it may be prudent to assess cognitive change as well as behavioral effects because improvements in the former do not necessarily forecast improvements in the latter in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and mental retardation.","Pearson Deborah A, Lane David M, Santos Cynthia W, Casat Charles D, Jerger Susan W, Loveland Katherine A, Faria Laura P, Mansour Rosleen, Henderson Jill A, Payne Christa D, Roache John D, Lachar David, Cleveland Lynne A",Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,"Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity, Behavior, Central Nervous System Stimulants, Child, Cognition, Cross-Over Studies, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Intellectual Disability, Male, Methylphenidate",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15167085,"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Texas Medical School at Houston 77030-3497, USA.

No evidence of a curvilinear dose-response relationship emerged for any measure. Inattention and disinhibition/impulsivity decline with MPH treatment in children with ADHD/MR, and consistent with the Multimodal Treatment Study of ADHD, higher MPH doses are most effective.

17692731,10.1016/J.Clinthera.2007.06.017,Transition from methylphenidate or amphetamine to atomoxetine in children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder--a preliminary tolerability and efficacy study.,2007-06-01,"The primary treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been psychostimulants. Recently developed nonpsychostimulant treatments have allowed certain patients to switch from a psychostimulant to a nonpsychostimulant. However, the outcomes of such switches have not been systematically studied. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess treatment tolerance and efficacy during a cross-taper transition from methylphenidate or amphetamine to atomoxetine among children and adolescents with ADHD. This pilot study was conducted in patients (aged 6-17 years) with incomplete responses (failure to obtain full reduction/elimination of symptoms) or intolerance of adverse events (AEs) during psychostimulant treatment. Patients continued ongoing psychostimulant treatment during the first week of the study. Transition to atomoxetine began by administering atomoxetine 0.5 mg/kg . d plus full-dose psychostimulant for 1 week, followed in the second week by 1.2 mg/kg . d atomoxetine plus half-dose psychostimulant. Patients remained on 1.2 mg/kg . d atomoxetine monotherapy for the remaining 5 weeks. This stepwise transition was enacted due to the difference in pharmacodynamics between the psychostimulants and atomoxetine. Applying a stepwise cross-titration allowed for better control of ADHD symptoms during the intervening period. Change in ADHD symptoms, as measured by the mean change in the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-IV-Parent Version: Investigator-administered and -scored (ADHDRS-IV-Parent:Inv), was assessed from baseline to end point. Of the 62 subjects enrolled in the study, 39 (62.9%) were diagnosed as ADHD-combined type. Similar proportions were receiving methylphenidate (51.6%) and amphetamine (48.4%). Slightly more wished to switch due to inadequate response (53.2%) than intolerability (46.8%). Nine subjects discontinued at various times during the course of the study (patient or parent/caregiver decision [4], AE [2], protocol violation [2], and lack of efficacy [1]). Mean (SD) ADHDRS-IV-Parent:Inv total scores (n = 59, last-observation-carried-forward) improved significantly from baseline (visit 2) to an end point (32.1 [10.5] vs 22.6 [14.0]; P < 0.001). Of the 58 subjects answering in the atomoxetine monotherapy phase, 38 (65.5%) reported a preference for atomoxetine treatment over their previous psychostimulant.

No clinically severe AEs were reported. Both mean (SD) diastolic (2.4 [7.8] mm Hg; P = 0.031) and systolic (2.4 [7.9] mm Hg; P = 0.029) blood pressures increased significantly from baseline to end point.

These studies mostly demonstrated the acute effects of single-dose administrations, examining task-dependent effects of oxytocin on brain activity elicited during explicit experimental tasks or stimuli presentations. The increased consideration of oxytocin as a potential ameliorating treatment in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) requires a better understanding of how multiple-dose oxytocin administration affects intrinsic, task-free, amygdala function. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with between-subject design, 38 adult men with ASD underwent resting-state fMRI scanning before and after oxytocin or placebo treatment. Effects were assessed either after a single-dose administration, consisting of 24 international units, or after multiple-dose treatment, consisting of 4 weeks of once-daily nasal spray administrations. Compared to placebo, oxytocin induced a decrease in intrinsic resting-state BOLD signal amplitudes of the bilateral amygdala (fractional amplitudes of low-frequency fluctuations) and modulated cross-frequency interactions between adjacent BOLD frequency components. The right amygdala showed a pattern of reduced cross-frequency harmonicity, while the left amygdala showed a relative increase in harmonic cross-frequency interactions after oxytocin treatment. Notably, the direction and magnitude of BOLD spectral changes induced after a single-dose were qualitatively similar to treatment effects induced after multiple-dose treatment. Furthermore, the identified spectral changes in amygdalar BOLD amplitude and cross-frequency harmonicity were associated with improved feelings of tension, reflecting oxytocin's anxiolytic, stress-reducing neuromodulatory role. The observed effects of oxytocin on amygdalar BOLD spectral characteristics and associated behaviors contribute to a deeper mechanistic understanding of the intrinsic, task-free neuromodulatory dynamics that underlie single- and multiple-dose oxytocin treatment in ASD.

Thirty-eight adult men with ASD (aged between 18 and 35 years) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging of the posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTS) and amygdala regions while processing emotional states from point-light biological motion. In line with prior research, a single dose of IN-OT induced a reliable increase in pSTS brain activity during the processing of point-light biological motion, but no consistent long-term changes in pSTS activity were induced after the multiple-dose treatment. In terms of bilateral amygdala, the multiple-dose treatment induced a consistent attenuation in brain activity, which outlasted the period of actual administrations until four weeks and one year post-treatment. Critically, participants with stronger attenuations in amygdala-activity showed greater behavioral improvements, particularly in terms of self-reported feelings of avoidant attachment and social functioning. Together, these observations provide initial insights into the long-lasting neural consequences of chronic IN-OT use on amygdala functioning and provide first indications that the acute versus chronic effects of IN-OT administration may be qualitatively different.

Untargeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was performed to analyse baseline levels of 68 serum metabolites. Of the nine metabolites that differentiated placebo and NAC groups, five were amino acids with lower levels in the NAC responder group compared with the NAC non-responders.

However, anything from 40-60 % of people on clozapine experience residual symptoms even on adequate doses of the medication, and thus could be considered 'clozapine resistant'. Agents that could work alongside clozapine to improve efficacy whilst not increasing the adverse effect burden are both desired and necessary to improve the lives of individuals with clozapine-resistant SZ. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is one such possible agent. Previous research from our research group provided promising pilot data suggesting the efficacy of NAC in this patient population. The aim of the study reported here is to expand this work by conducting a large scale clinical trial of NAC in the treatment of clozapine-resistant SZ. This study is an investigator initiated, multi-site, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. It aims to include 168 patients with clozapine-resistant SZ, divided into an intervention group (NAC) and a control group (placebo). Participants in the intervention group will receive 2 g daily of NAC. The primary outcome measures will be the negative symptom scores of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Secondary outcome measures will include: changes in quality of life (QoL) as measured by the Lancashire Quality of Life Profile (LQoLP) and cognitive functioning as measured by the total score on the MATRICS. Additionally we will examine peripheral and cortical glutathione (GSH) concentrations as process outcomes. This large scale clinical trial will investigate the efficacy of NAC as an adjunctive medication to clozapine.

27502769,10.1186/S13063-016-1529-4,The Post-Anaesthesia N-acetylcysteine Cognitive Evaluation (PANACEA) trial: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.,2016-08-09,"Some degree of cognitive decline after surgery occurs in as many as one quarter of elderly surgical patients, and this decline is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Cognition may be affected across a range of domains, including memory, psychomotor skills, and executive function. Whilst the exact mechanisms of cognitive change after surgery are not precisely known, oxidative stress and subsequent neuroinflammation have been implicated. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) acts via multiple interrelated mechanisms to influence oxidative homeostasis, neuronal transmission, and inflammation. NAC has been shown to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in both human and animal models. There is clinical evidence to suggest that NAC may be beneficial in preventing the cognitive decline associated with both acute physiological insults and dementia-related disorders. To date, no trials have examined perioperative NAC as a potential moderator of postoperative cognitive changes in the noncardiac surgery setting. This is a single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, with a between-group, repeated-measures, longitudinal design. The study will recruit 370 noncardiac surgical patients at the University Hospital Geelong, aged 60 years or older. Participants are randomly assigned to receive either NAC or placebo (1:1 ratio), and groups are stratified by age and surgery type. Participants undergo a series of neuropsychological tests prior to surgery, 7 days, 3 months, and 12 months post surgery. It is hypothesised that the perioperative administration of NAC will reduce the degree of postoperative cognitive changes at early and long-term follow-up, as measured by changes on individual measures of the neurocognitive battery, when compared with placebo. Serum samples are taken on the day of surgery and on day 2 post surgery to quantitate any changes in levels of biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress. The PANACEA trial aims to examine the potential efficacy of perioperative NAC to reduce the severity of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in an elderly, noncardiac surgery population. This is an entirely novel approach to the prevention of postoperative cognitive dysfunction and will have high impact and translatable outcomes if NAC is found to be beneficial.

We sought to examine the feasibility of a novel, Internet-based clinical trial design to evaluate the efficacy of this supplement. E-mail invitations were sent to parents of children aged 5 to 8 years enrolled in the Interactive Autism Network. All study procedures, including screening, informed consent, and collection of outcome measures took place over the Internet. The primary outcome measures were parent- and teacher-rated changes in hyperactivity on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC-H). During the 6-week recruitment period, 57 children from 28 states satisfied all eligibility criteria and were randomly assigned to 1.3 grams of omega-3 fatty acids or an identical placebo daily for 6 weeks. Outcome assessments were obtained from all 57 participants and 57 teachers, and the study was completed in 3 months. Children in the omega-3 fatty acid group had a greater reduction in hyperactivity (-5.3 points) compared to the placebo group (-2.6 points), but the difference was not statistically significant (1.9-point greater improvement in the omega-3 group, 95% CI = -2.2 to 5.2). Adverse events were rare and not associated with omega-3 fatty acids. Participant feedback was positive. Internet-based, randomized controlled trials of therapies in children with ASD are feasible and may lead to marked reductions in the time and cost of completing trials.

Furthermore, chronic redox imbalance was also recently linked to this disorder. The goal of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility of using oral N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a glutamatergic modulator and an antioxidant, in the treatment of behavioral disturbance in children with autism. This was a 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of NAC in children with autistic disorder. Subjects randomized to NAC were initiated at 900 mg daily for 4 weeks, then 900 mg twice daily for 4 weeks and 900 mg three times daily for 4 weeks. The primary behavioral measure (Aberrant Behavior Checklist [ABC] irritability subscale) and safety measures were performed at baseline and 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Secondary measures included the ABC stereotypy subscale, Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised, and Social Responsiveness Scale. Thirty-three subjects (31 male subjects, 2 female subjects; aged 3.2-10.7 years) were randomized in the study. Follow-up data was available on 14 subjects in the NAC group and 15 in the placebo group. Oral NAC was well tolerated with limited side effects. Compared with placebo, NAC resulted in significant improvements on ABC irritability subscale (F = 6.80; p < .001; d = .96). Data from this pilot investigation support the potential usefulness of NAC for treating irritability in children with autistic disorder. Large randomized controlled investigations are warranted.","Hardan Antonio Y, Fung Lawrence K, Libove Robin A, Obukhanych Tetyana V, Nair Surekha, Herzenberg Leonore A, Frazier Thomas W, Tirouvanziam Rabindra",Biological psychiatry,"Acetylcysteine, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Double-Blind Method, Female, Free Radical Scavengers, Humans, Irritable Mood, Male, Pilot Projects, Stereotyped Behavior, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22342106,"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, USA. hardanay@stanford.edu"
36609850,10.1002/Aur.2884,Genetic and epigenetic signatures associated with plasma oxytocin levels in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder.,2023-03-01,"Oxytocin (OT), the brain's most abundant neuropeptide, plays an important role in social salience and motivation. Clinical trials of the efficacy of OT in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have reported mixed results due in part to ASD's complex etiology. We investigated whether genetic and epigenetic variation contribute to variable endogenous OT levels that modulate sensitivity to OT therapy. To carry out this analysis, we integrated genome-wide profiles of DNA-methylation, transcriptional activity, and genetic variation with plasma OT levels in 290 participants with ASD enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of OT. Our analysis identified genetic variants with novel association with plasma OT, several of which reside in known ASD risk genes. We also show subtle but statistically significant association of plasma OT levels with peripheral transcriptional activity and DNA-methylation profiles across several annotated gene sets. These findings broaden our understanding of the effects of the peripheral oxytocin system and provide novel genetic candidates for future studies to decode the complex etiology of ASD and its interaction with OT signaling and OT-based interventions. LAY SUMMARY: Oxytocin (OT) is an abundant chemical produced by neurons that plays an important role in social interaction and motivation. We investigated whether genetic and epigenetic factors contribute to variable OT levels in the blood. To this, we integrated genetic, gene expression, and non-DNA regulated (epigenetic) signatures with blood OT levels in 290 participants with autism enrolled in an OT clinical trial. We identified genetic association with plasma OT, several of which reside in known autism risk genes. We also show statistically significant association of plasma OT levels with gene expression and epigenetic across several gene pathways. These findings broaden our understanding of the factors that influence OT levels in the blood for future studies to decode the complex presentation of autism and its interaction with OT and OT-based treatment.","Siecinski Stephen K, Giamberardino Stephanie N, Spanos Marina, Hauser Annalise C, Gibson Jason R, Chandrasekhar Tara, Trelles Maria Del Pilar, Rockhill Carol M, Palumbo Michelle L, Cundiff Allyson Witters, Montgomery Alicia, Siper Paige, Minjarez Mendy, Nowinski Lisa A, Marler Sarah, Kwee Lydia C, Shuffrey Lauren C, Alderman Cheryl, Weissman Jordana, Zappone Brooke, Mullett Jennifer E, Crosson Hope, Hong Natalie, Luo Sheng, She Lilin, Bhapkar Manjushri, Dean Russell, Scheer Abby, Johnson Jacqueline L, King Bryan H, McDougle Christopher J, Sanders Kevin B, Kim Soo-Jeong, Kolevzon Alexander, Veenstra-VanderWeele Jeremy, Hauser Elizabeth R, Sikich Linmarie, Gregory Simon G",Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research,"Humans, Child, Adolescent, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Oxytocin, Autistic Disorder, DNA Methylation, Epigenesis, Genetic",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36609850,"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Seattle Children's Hospital and the University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.; Duke Molecular Physiology Institute, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Duke Clinical Research Institute, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA."

Oxytocin has been administered in clinical practice to many children with autism spectrum disorder. We conducted a 24-week, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial of intranasal oxytocin therapy in children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with autism spectrum disorder. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, with stratification according to age and verbal fluency, to receive oxytocin or placebo, administered intranasally, with a total target dose of 48 international units daily. The primary outcome was the least-squares mean change from baseline on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist modified Social Withdrawal subscale (ABC-mSW), which includes 13 items (scores range from 0 to 39, with higher scores indicating less social interaction). Secondary outcomes included two additional measures of social function and an abbreviated measure of IQ. Of the 355 children and adolescents who underwent screening, 290 were enrolled. A total of 146 participants were assigned to the oxytocin group and 144 to the placebo group; 139 and 138 participants, respectively, completed both the baseline and at least one postbaseline ABC-mSW assessments and were included in the modified intention-to-treat analyses.

35067719,10.1093/Brain/Awab291,Effect of a novel nasal oxytocin spray with enhanced bioavailability on autism: a randomized trial.,2022-04-18,"Although intranasal oxytocin is expected to be a novel therapy for the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, which has currently no approved medication, the efficacy of repeated administrations was inconsistent, suggesting that the optimal dose for a single administration of oxytocin is not optimal for repeated administration. The current double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, crossover trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03466671) was aimed to test the effect of TTA-121, a new formulation of intranasal oxytocin spray with an enhanced bioavailability (3.6 times higher than Syntocinon® spray, as assessed by area under the concentration-time curve in rabbit brains), which enabled us to test a wide range of multiple doses, on autism spectrum disorder core symptoms and to determine the dose-response relationship. Four-week administrations of TTA-121, at low dose once per day (3 U/day), low dose twice per day (6 U/day), high dose once per day (10 U/day), or high dose twice per day (20 U/day), and 4-week placebo were administered in a crossover manner. The primary outcome was the mean difference in the reciprocity score (range: 0-14, higher values represent worse outcomes) on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule between the baseline and end point of each administration period. This trial with two administration periods and eight groups was conducted at seven university hospitals in Japan, enrolling adult males with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder. Enrolment began from June 2018 and ended December 2019. Follow-up ended March 2020. Of 109 males with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder who were randomized, 103 completed the trial. The smallest P-value, judged as the dose-response relationship, was the contrast with the peak at TTA-121 6 U/day, with inverted U-shape for both the full analysis set (P = 0.182) and per protocol set (P = 0.073). The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule reciprocity score, the primary outcome, was reduced in the TTA-121 6 U/day administration period compared with the placebo (full analysis set: P = 0.118, mean difference = -0.5; 95% CI: -1.1 to 0.1; per protocol set: P = 0.012, mean difference = -0.8; 95% CI: -1.3 to -0.2). The per protocol set was the analysis target population, consisting of all full analysis set participants except those who deviated from the protocol. Most dropouts from the full analysis set to the per protocol set occurred because of poor adherence to the test drug (9 of 12 in the first period and 8 of 15 in the second period). None of the secondary clinical and behavioural outcomes were significantly improved with the TTA-121 compared with the placebo in the full analysis set. A novel intranasal spray of oxytocin with enhanced bioavailability enabled us to test a wide range of multiple doses, revealing an inverted U-shape dose-response curve, with the peak at a dose that was lower than expected from previous studies. The efficacy of TTA-121 shown in the current exploratory study should be verified in a future large-scale, parallel-group trial.","Yamasue Hidenori, Kojima Masaki, Kuwabara Hitoshi, Kuroda Miho, Matsumoto Kaori, Kanai Chieko, Inada Naoko, Owada Keiho, Ochi Keiko, Ono Nobutaka, Benner Seico, Wakuda Tomoyasu, Kameno Yosuke, Inoue Jun, Harada Taeko, Tsuchiya Kenji, Umemura Kazuo, Yamauchi Aya, Ogawa Nanayo, Kushima Itaru, Ozaki Norio, Suyama Satoshi, Saito Takuya, Uemura Yukari, Hamada Junko, Kano Yukiko, Honda Nami, Kikuchi Saya, Seto Moe, Tomita Hiroaki, Miyoshi Noriko, Matsumoto Megumi, Kawaguchi Yuko, Kanai Koji, Ikeda Manabu, Nakamura Itta, Isomura Shuichi, Hirano Yoji, Onitsuka Toshiaki, Kosaka Hirotaka, Okada Takashi",Brain : a journal of neurology,"Administration, Intranasal, Animals, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Biological Availability, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Nasal Sprays, Oxytocin, Rabbits, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35067719,"Graduate School of Psychology, Kanazawa Institute of Technology, 7-1 Ohgigaoka, Nonoichi 921-8054, Japan.; School of Media Science, Tokyo University of Technology, Hachioji, Japan.; Child Development and Education, Faculty of Humanities, Wayo Women's University, Konodai 2-3-1, Ichikawa, Chiba 272-0827, Japan.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashiku, Hamamatsu City 431-3192, Japan.; Department of Psychiatry, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashiku, Hamamatsu City 431-3192, Japan.; Department of Psychiatry, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.; Department of Psychology, Faculty of Liberal Arts, Teikyo University, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Psychiatry, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, 65 Tsurumai-cho, Showa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi 466-8550, Japan.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.; Department of Medical Technique, Nagoya University Hospital, 65 Tsurumai-cho, Showa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi 466-8560, Japan.; Department of Pharmacology, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashiku, Hamamatsu City 431-3192, Japan.; Department of Psychiatry, Graduate School of Medicine, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.; Department of Child Development, United Graduate School of Child Development at Hamamatsu, 1-20-1 Handayama, Higashiku, Hamamatsu 431-3192, Japan.; Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.; Department of Child Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.; Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.; Department of Computer Science, Graduate School of Systems Design, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Hino, Japan.; Biostatistics Section, Department of Data Science, Center for Clinical Science, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Shinjyu-ku, Tokyo 162-8655, Japan.; Department of Neuropsychiatry, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, Eiheiji, Fukui 910-1193, Japan."
33622389,10.1186/S13229-021-00423-Z,"Oxytocin-induced increase in N,N-dimethylglycine and time course of changes in oxytocin efficacy for autism social core symptoms.",2021-02-23,"Oxytocin is expected as a novel therapeutic agent for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) core symptoms. However, previous results on the efficacy of repeated administrations of oxytocin are controversial. Recently, we reported time-course changes in the efficacy of the neuropeptide underlying the controversial effects of repeated administration; however, the underlying mechanisms remained unknown. The current study explored metabolites representing the molecular mechanisms of oxytocin's efficacy using high-throughput metabolomics analysis on plasma collected before and after 6-week repeated intranasal administration of oxytocin (48 IU/day) or placebo in adult males with ASD (N = 106) who participated in a multi-center, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial. Among the 35 metabolites measured, a significant increase in N,N-dimethylglycine was detected in the subjects administered oxytocin compared with those given placebo at a medium effect size (false discovery rate (FDR) corrected P = 0.043, d = 0.74, N = 83). Furthermore, subgroup analyses of the participants displaying a prominent time-course change in oxytocin efficacy revealed a significant effect of oxytocin on N,N-dimethylglycine levels with a large effect size (P<sub>FDR</sub> = 0.004, d = 1.13, N = 60). The increase in N,N-dimethylglycine was significantly correlated with oxytocin-induced clinical changes, assessed as changes in quantifiable characteristics of autistic facial expression, including both of improvements between baseline and 2 weeks (P<sub>FDR</sub> = 0.006, r = - 0.485, N = 43) and deteriorations between 2 and 4 weeks (P<sub>FDR</sub> = 0.032, r = 0.415, N = 37). The metabolites changes caused by oxytocin administration were quantified using peripheral blood and therefore may not directly reflect central nervous system changes.

However, current treatments do not significantly ameliorate social impairments in CHR-P individuals. Given its critical role in social behaviour and cognition, the oxytocinergic (OT) system is a promising target for novel interventions in CHR-P subjects. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, 30 CHR-P males were studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on two occasions, once after 40IU self-administered intranasal OT and once after placebo. A modified version of the Sally-Anne task was used to assess brain activation during inferring others' beliefs and social emotions. The Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test was acquired prior to the first scan to test whether OT effects were moderated by baseline social-emotional abilities. OT did not modulate behavioural performances but reduced activation in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus compared with placebo while inferring others' social emotions. Furthermore, the relationship between brain activation and task performance after OT administration was moderated by baseline social-emotional abilities. While task accuracy during inferring others' social emotion increased with decreasing activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus in CHR-P individuals with low social-emotional abilities, there was no such relationship in CHR-P individuals with high social-emotional abilities. Our findings may suggest that acute OT administration enhances neural efficiency in the inferior frontal gyrus during inferring others' social emotions in those CHR-P subjects with low baseline social-emotional abilities.","Schmidt André, Davies Cathy, Paloyelis Yannis, Meyer Nicholas, De Micheli Andrea, Ramella-Cravaro Valentina, Provenzani Umberto, Aoki Yuta, Rutigliano Grazia, Cappucciati Marco, Oliver Dominic, Murguia Silvia, Zelaya Fernando, Allen Paul, Shergill Sukhi, Morrison Paul, Williams Steve, Taylor David, Borgwardt Stefan, Yamasue Hidenori, McGuire Philip, Fusar-Poli Paolo",Translational psychiatry,"Administration, Intranasal, Brain, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Emotions, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Oxytocin, Psychotic Disorders",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32572020,"Department of Neuroimaging, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, King's College London, London, UK.; Early Psychosis: Interventions and Clinical-detection (EPIC) lab, Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; Tower Hamlets Early Detection Service (THEDS), East London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.; Department of Psychiatry (UPK), University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland. andre.schmidt@unibas.ch.; Department of Psychiatry, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Shizuoka, Japan.; Department of Psychiatry (UPK), University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland."
31096266,10.1093/Brain/Awz126,Quantitative facial expression analysis revealed the efficacy and time course of oxytocin in autism.,2019-07-01,"Discrepancies in efficacy between single-dose and repeated administration of oxytocin for autism spectrum disorder have led researchers to hypothesize that time-course changes in efficacy are induced by repeated administrations of the peptide hormone. However, repeatable, objective, and quantitative measurement of autism spectrum disorder's core symptoms are lacking, making it difficult to examine potential time-course changes in efficacy. We tested this hypothesis using repeatable, objective, and quantitative measurement of the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. We examined videos recorded during semi-structured social interaction administered as the primary outcome in single-site exploratory (n = 18, crossover within-subjects design) and multisite confirmatory (n = 106, parallel-group design), double-blind, placebo-controlled 6-week trials of repeated intranasal administrations of oxytocin (48 IU/day) in adult males with autism spectrum disorder. The main outcomes were statistical representative values of objectively quantified facial expression intensity in a repeatable part of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule: the maximum probability (i.e. mode) and the natural logarithm of mode on the probability density function of neutral facial expression and the natural logarithm of mode on the probability density function of happy expression. Our recent study revealed that increases in these indices characterize autistic facial expression, compared with neurotypical individuals. The current results revealed that oxytocin consistently and significantly decreased the increased natural logarithm of mode on the probability density function of neutral facial expression compared with placebo in exploratory (effect-size, -0.57; 95% CI, -1.27 to 0.13; P = 0.023) and confirmatory trials (-0.41; -0.62 to -0.20; P < 0.001). A significant interaction between time-course (at baseline, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks) and the efficacy of oxytocin on the natural logarithm of mode on the probability density function of neutral facial expression was found in confirmatory trial (P < 0.001). Post hoc analyses revealed maximum efficacy at 2 weeks (P < 0.001, Cohen's d = -0.78; 95% CI, -1.21 to -0.35) and deterioration of efficacy at 4 weeks (P = 0.042, Cohen's d = -0.46; 95% CI, -0.90 to -0.01) and 6 weeks (P = 0.10, Cohen's d = -0.35; 95% CI, -0.77 to 0.08), while efficacy was preserved at 2 weeks post-treatment (i.e. 8 weeks) (P < 0.001, Cohen's d = -1.24; 95% CI, -1.71 to -0.78). Quantitative facial expression analyses successfully verified the positive effects of repeated oxytocin on autistic individuals' facial expressions and demonstrated a time-course change in efficacy.

The current study employed a combination of human clinical trial and animal study to compare neurochemical changes induced by acute and repeated oxytocin administrations. Human study analyzed medial prefrontal metabolite levels by using <sup>1</sup>H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, a secondary outcome in our randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of 6 weeks intranasal administrations of oxytocin (48 IU/day) and placebo within-subject design in 17 psychotropic-free high-functioning men with autism spectrum disorder. Medial prefrontal transcript expression levels were analyzed in adult male C57BL/6J mice after intraperitoneal injection of oxytocin or saline either once (200 ng/100 μL/mouse, n = 12) or for 14 consecutive days (200 ng/100 μL/mouse/day, n = 16). As the results, repeated administration of oxytocin significantly decreased the medial prefrontal N-acetylaspartate (NAA; p = 0.043) and glutamate-glutamine levels (Glx; p = 0.001), unlike the acute oxytocin. The decreases were inversely and specifically associated (r = 0.680, p = 0.004 for NAA; r = 0.491, p = 0.053 for Glx) with oxytocin-induced improvements of medial prefrontal functional MRI activity during a social judgment task not with changes during placebo administrations. In wild-type mice, we found that repeated oxytocin administration reduced medial frontal transcript expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor type 2B (p = 0.018), unlike the acute oxytocin, which instead changed the transcript expression associated with oxytocin (p = 0.0004) and neural activity (p = 0.0002).

In this randomized, parallel-group, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in Japan, 106 ASD individuals (18-48 y.o.) were enrolled between Jan 2015 and March 2016. Participants were randomly assigned to a 6-week intranasal oxytocin (48IU/day, n = 53) or placebo (n = 53) group. One-hundred-three participants were analyzed. Since oxytocin reduced the primary endpoint, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) reciprocity, (from 8.5 to 7.7; P < .001) but placebo also reduced the score (8.3 to 7.2; P < .001), no between-group difference was found (effect size -0.08; 95% CI, -0.46 to 0.31; P = .69); however, plasma oxytocin was only elevated from baseline to endpoint in the oxytocin-group compared with the placebo-group (effect size -1.12; -1.53 to -0.70; P < .0001). Among the secondary endpoints, oxytocin reduced ADOS repetitive behavior (2.0 to 1.5; P < .0001) compared with placebo (2.0 to 1.8; P = .43) (effect size 0.44; 0.05 to 0.83; P = .026).

26336909,10.1093/Brain/Awv249,Clinical and neural effects of six-week administration of oxytocin on core symptoms of autism.,2015-11-01,"Autism spectrum disorder is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder with no established pharmacological treatment for its core symptoms. Although previous literature has shown that single-dose administration of oxytocin temporally mitigates autistic social behaviours in experimental settings, it remains in dispute whether such potentially beneficial responses in laboratories can result in clinically positive effects in daily life situations, which are measurable only in long-term observations of individuals with the developmental disorder undergoing continual oxytocin administration. Here, to address this issue, we performed an exploratory, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial including 20 high-functional adult males with autism spectrum disorder. Data obtained from 18 participants who completed the trial showed that 6-week intranasal administration of oxytocin significantly reduced autism core symptoms specific to social reciprocity, which was clinically evaluated by Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (P = 0.034, PFDR < 0.05, Cohen's d = 0.78). Critically, the improvement of this clinical score was accompanied by oxytocin-induced enhancement of task-independent resting-state functional connectivity between anterior cingulate cortex and dorso-medial prefrontal cortex (rho = -0.60, P = 0.011), which was measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Moreover, using the same social-judgement task as used in our previous single-dose oxytocin trial, we confirmed that the current continual administration also significantly mitigated behavioural and neural responses during the task, both of which were originally impaired in autistic individuals (judgement tendency: P = 0.019, d = 0.62; eye-gaze effect: P = 0.03, d = 0.56; anterior cingulate activity: P = 0.00069, d = 0.97; dorso-medial prefrontal activity: P = 0.0014, d = 0.92; all, PFDR < 0.05). Furthermore, despite its longer administration, these effect sizes of the 6-week intervention were not larger than those seen in our previous single-dose intervention. These findings not only provide the evidence for clinically beneficial effects of continual oxytocin administration on the core social symptoms of autism spectrum disorder with suggesting its underlying biological mechanisms, but also highlight the necessity to seek optimal regimens of continual oxytocin treatment in future studies.","Watanabe Takamitsu, Kuroda Miho, Kuwabara Hitoshi, Aoki Yuta, Iwashiro Norichika, Tatsunobu Natsubori, Takao Hidemasa, Nippashi Yasumasa, Kawakubo Yuki, Kunimatsu Akira, Kasai Kiyoto, Yamasue Hidenori",Brain : a journal of neurology,"Administration, Intranasal, Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Brain, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Functional Neuroimaging, Gyrus Cinguli, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Neural Pathways, Oxytocics, Oxytocin, Prefrontal Cortex, Social Behavior, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26336909,"5 Department of Radiology, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.; 1 Department of Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.; 4 Department of Child Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.; 1 Department of Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan 2 Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan 3 Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, 17 Queen Square, London, WC1N 3AR, UK.; 1 Department of Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan 6 Japan Science and Technology Agency, CREST, 5 Sambancho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 102-0075, Japan yamasue-tky@umin.ac.jp."
25149412,10.1093/Brain/Awu231,Oxytocin improves behavioural and neural deficits in inferring others' social emotions in autism.,2014-11-01,"Recent studies have suggested oxytocin's therapeutic effects on deficits in social communication and interaction in autism spectrum disorder through improvement of emotion recognition with direct emotional cues, such as facial expression and voice prosody. Although difficulty in understanding of others' social emotions and beliefs under conditions without direct emotional cues also plays an important role in autism spectrum disorder, no study has examined the potential effect of oxytocin on this difficulty. Here, we sequentially conducted both a case-control study and a clinical trial to investigate the potential effects of oxytocin on this difficulty at behavioural and neural levels measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging during a psychological task. This task was modified from the Sally-Anne Task, a well-known first-order false belief task. The task was optimized for investigation of the abilities to infer another person's social emotions and beliefs distinctively so as to test the hypothesis that oxytocin improves deficit in inferring others' social emotions rather than beliefs, under conditions without direct emotional cues. In the case-control study, 17 males with autism spectrum disorder showed significant behavioural deficits in inferring others' social emotions (P = 0.018) but not in inferring others' beliefs (P = 0.064) compared with 17 typically developing demographically-matched male participants. They also showed significantly less activity in the right anterior insula and posterior superior temporal sulcus during inferring others' social emotions, and in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex during inferring others' beliefs compared with the typically developing participants (P < 0.001 and cluster size > 10 voxels). Then, to investigate potential effects of oxytocin on these behavioural and neural deficits, we conducted a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover within-subject trial for single-dose intranasal administration of 24 IU oxytocin in an independent group of 20 males with autism spectrum disorder. Behaviourally, oxytocin significantly increased the correct rate in inferring others' social emotions (P = 0.043, one-tail). At the neural level, the peptide significantly enhanced the originally-diminished brain activity in the right anterior insula during inferring others' social emotions (P = 0.004), but not in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex during inferring others' beliefs (P = 0.858). The present findings suggest that oxytocin enhances the ability to understand others' social emotions that have also required second-order false belief rather than first-order false beliefs under conditions without direct emotional cues in autism spectrum disorder at both the behaviour and neural levels.","Aoki Yuta, Yahata Noriaki, Watanabe Takamitsu, Takano Yosuke, Kawakubo Yuki, Kuwabara Hitoshi, Iwashiro Norichika, Natsubori Tatsunobu, Inoue Hideyuki, Suga Motomu, Takao Hidemasa, Sasaki Hiroki, Gonoi Wataru, Kunimatsu Akira, Kasai Kiyoto, Yamasue Hidenori",Brain : a journal of neurology,"Adult, Case-Control Studies, Cerebral Cortex, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Emotions, Empathy, Facial Expression, Functional Neuroimaging, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Oxytocin, Placebos, Social Perception, Theory of Mind, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25149412,"1 Department of Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.; 1 Department of Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan 5 Japan Science and Technology Agency, CREST, 5 Sambancho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 102-0075, Japan yamasue-tky@umin.ac.jp.; 2 Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.; 4 Department of Radiology, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.; 3 Department of Child Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan."

Despite growing prospects for oxytocin as a therapeutic agent for ASD, no direct neurobiological evidence exists for oxytocin's beneficial effects on this core symptom of ASD. This is slowing clinical application of the neuropeptide. To directly examine whether oxytocin has beneficial effects on the sociocommunicational deficits of ASD using both behavioral and neural measures. At the University of Tokyo Hospital, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject-crossover, single-site experimental trial in which intranasal oxytocin and placebo were administered. A total of 40 highly functioning men with ASD participated and were randomized in the trial. Single-dose intranasal administration of oxytocin (24 IU) and placebo. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined effects of oxytocin on behavioral neural responses of the participants to a social psychological task. In our previous case-control study using the same psychological task, when making decisions about social information with conflicting verbal and nonverbal contents, participants with ASD made judgments based on nonverbal contents less frequently with longer time and could not induce enough activation in the medial prefrontal cortex. Therefore, our main outcomes and measures were the frequency of the nonverbal information-based judgments (NVJs), the response time for NVJs, and brain activity of the medial prefrontal cortex during NVJs. Intranasal oxytocin enabled the participants to make NVJs more frequently (P = .03) with shorter response time (P = .02). During the mitigated behavior, oxytocin increased the originally diminished brain activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (P < .001). Moreover, oxytocin enhanced functional coordination in the area (P < .001), and the magnitude of these neural effects was predictive of the behavioral effects (P ≤ .01).

The outcomes in this analysis include Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), Aberrant Behavior Checklist second edition (ABC-2), Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, SpCO measured by CO-oximetry, fecal microbiome by 16 s rRNA sequencing, blood serum inflammatory markers, autoantibodies, and oxytocin (OT) by ELISA. We performed Kendall's correlation to examine their interrelationships and used Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare the means of all outcomes between the two groups at baseline and 16 weeks. Elevated levels of serum anti-tubulin, CaM kinase II, anti-dopamine receptor D1 (anti-D1), and SpCO were found in the majority of ASD subjects. ASD severity is correlated with SpCO (baseline, R = 0.38, p = 0.029), anti-lysoganglioside GM1 (R = 0.83, p = 0.022), anti-tubulin (R = 0.69, p = 0.042), and anti-D1 (R = 0.71, p = 0.045) in treatment group. The findings of the present study suggests that the easily administered and non-invasive SpCO test offers a potentially promising autoimmunity and inflammatory biomarker to screen/subgroup ASD and monitor the treatment response to probiotics. Furthermore, we propose that the associations between autoantibodies, gut microbiome profile, serum OT level, GI symptom severity, and ASD core symptom severity scores are specific to the usage of probiotic treatment in our subject cohort. Taken together, these results warrant further studies to improve ASD early diagnosis and treatment outcomes.

GI symptoms are of particular interest in this population due to prevalence and correlation with the severity of behavioural traits. Nowadays, there is lack of strong evidence about the effect of dietary interventions on these problems, particularly prebiotics. Therefore, we assessed the impact of exclusion diets and a 6-week Bimuno® galactooligosaccharide (B-GOS®) prebiotic intervention in 30 autistic children. The results showed that children on exclusion diets reported significantly lower scores of abdominal pain and bowel movement, as well as lower abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. and Veillonellaceae family, but higher presence of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bacteroides spp. In addition, significant correlations were found between bacterial populations and faecal amino acids in this group, compared to children following an unrestricted diet. Following B-GOS® intervention, we observed improvements in anti-social behaviour, significant increase of Lachnospiraceae family, and significant changes in faecal and urine metabolites. To our knowledge, this is the first study where the effect of exclusion diets and prebiotics has been evaluated in autism, showing potential beneficial effects.

Measures included caregiver-reported Sleep and Nap Diary, Composite Sleep Disturbance Index (CSDI), caregiver's Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and quality of life (WHO-5 Well-Being Index). <b><i>Results:</i></b> Ninety-five subjects (74.7% males; mean [standard deviation] age, 9 [4.24]; range, 2-17.5 years) received PedPRM (2/5 mg) according to the double-blind phase dose, for 39 weeks with optional dose adjustment (2, 5, or 10 mg/day) after the first 13 weeks. After 52 weeks of continuous treatment (PedPRM-randomized group) subjects slept (mean [SE]) 62.08 (21.5) minutes longer (<i>p</i> = 0.007); fell asleep 48.6 (10.2) minutes faster (<i>p</i> < 0.001); had 89.1 (25.5) minutes longer uninterrupted sleep episodes (<i>p</i> = 0.001); 0.41 (0.12) less nightly awakenings (>50% decrease; <i>p</i> = 0.001); and better sleep quality (<i>p</i> < 0.001) compared with baseline. The placebo-randomized group also improved with PedPRM. Altogether, by the end of 39-week follow-up, regardless of randomization assignment, 55/72 (76%) of completers achieved overall improvement of ≥1 hour in total sleep time (TST), sleep latency or both, over baseline, with no evidence of decreased efficacy.

A total of 125 children and adolescents (2-17.5 years of age; 96.8% ASD, 3.2% Smith-Magenis syndrome [SMS]) whose sleep failed to improve on behavioral intervention alone were randomized (1:1 ratio), double-blind, to receive PedPRM (2 mg escalated to 5 mg) or placebo for 13 weeks. Sleep measures included the validated caregivers' Sleep and Nap Diary (SND) and Composite Sleep Disturbance Index (CSDI). The a priori primary endpoint was SND-reported total sleep time (TST) after 13 weeks of treatment. The study met the primary endpoint: after 13 weeks of double-blind treatment, participants slept on average 57.5 minutes longer at night with PedPRM compared to 9.14 minutes with placebo (adjusted mean treatment difference PedPRM-placebo -32.43 minutes; p = .034). Sleep latency (SL) decreased by 39.6 minutes on average with PedPRM and 12.5 minutes with placebo (adjusted mean treatment difference -25.30 minutes; p = .011) without causing earlier wakeup time. The rate of participants attaining clinically meaningful responses in TST and/or SL was significantly higher with PedPRM than with placebo (68.9% versus 39.3% respectively; p = .001) corresponding to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 3.38. Overall sleep disturbance (CSDI) tended to decrease. PedPRM was generally safe; somnolence was more commonly reported with PedPRM than placebo.

However, it is unknown whether GT affects disposition of hydrophilic anti-allergic drugs. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine are affected by catechins, major GT components. A randomized, open, 2-phase crossover study was conducted in 10 healthy Japanese volunteers. After overnight fasting, subjects were simultaneously administered fexofenadine (60 mg) and pseudoephedrine (120 mg) with an aqueous solution of green tea extract (GTE) containing (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) of ~ 300 mg or water (control). In vitro transport assays were performed using HEK293 cells stably expressing organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1A2 to evaluate the inhibitory effect of EGCG on OATP1A2-mediated fexofenadine transport. In the GTE phase, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and the amount excreted unchanged into urine for 24 hours of fexofenadine were significantly decreased by 70% (P < 0.001) and 67% (P < 0.001), respectively, compared with control. There were no differences in time to maximum plasma concentration and the elimination half-life of fexofenadine between phases. Fexofenadine was confirmed to be a substrate of OATP1A2, and EGCG (100 and 1,000 μM) and GTE (0.1 and 1 mg/mL) inhibited OATP1A2-mediated uptake of fexofenadine. On the contrary, the concomitant administration of GTE did not influence the pharmacokinetics of pseudoephedrine. These results suggest that intake of GT may result in a markedly reduced exposure of fexofenadine, but not of pseudoephedrine, putatively by inhibiting OATP1A2-mediated intestinal absorption.","Misaka Shingen, Ono Yuko, Taudte R Verena, Hoier Eva, Ogata Hiroshi, Ono Tomoyuki, König Jörg, Watanabe Hiroshi, Fromm Martin F, Shimomura Kenju",Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,"Antioxidants, Catechin, Cross-Over Studies, HEK293 Cells, Healthy Volunteers, Humans, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Plant Extracts, Pseudoephedrine, Tea, Terfenadine",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35678032,"Institute of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Erlangen, Germany.; Department of Bioregulation and Pharmacological Medicine, School of Medicine, Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine, Fukushima, Japan.; Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan."

Green tea consumption may reduce the risk of cardiovascular outcomes and total mortality, whereas green tea or its catechin components has been reported to decrease plasma concentrations of a hydrophilic β blocker, nadolol, in humans. The aim of this study was to evaluate possible effects of green tea extract (GTE) on the lisinopril pharmacokinetics. In an open-label, randomized, single-center, 2-phase crossover study, 10 healthy subjects ingested 200 mL of an aqueous solution of GTE containing ~ 300 mg of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate, a major catechin component in green tea, or water (control) when receiving 10 mg of lisinopril after overnight fasting.

In contrast, there were no significant differences in time to reach maximum lisinopril concentration (6 hours in both phases) and renal clearance of lisinopril (57.7 mL/minute in control vs. 56.9 mL/minute in GTE). These results suggest that the extent of intestinal absorption of lisinopril was significantly impaired in the presence of GTE, whereas it had no major effect on the absorption rate and renal excretion of lisinopril.

Acute exercise mobilizes effector lymphocytes and VSTs to the circulation and augments the ex vivo manufacture of VSTs. This study determined if β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptor (AR) signaling precipitated the VST response to acute exercise. Healthy participants (n = 12) completed 30 min of steady-state cycling exercise after ingesting a placebo, a β<sub>1 + 2</sub> AR antagonist (nadolol) or a β<sub>1</sub> AR antagonist (bisoprolol). Circulating VSTs to cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and adenovirus (AdV) antigens were enumerated before and after exercise, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured with viral peptides for 8 days to expand multi-VSTs. Compared with placebo, nadolol blunted the exercise-induced mobilization of CMV-VSTs (Δ VSTs/100,000 CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells = 93 ± 104 vs. 22 ± 91 for placebo and nadolol, respectively; p = 0.036), while bisoprolol did not, despite both drugs evoking similar reductions in exercising heart rate and blood pressure. Circulating AdV and EBV VSTs (VSTs/mL blood) only increased after exercise with placebo. Although not significant, nadolol partially mitigated exercise-induced increases in multi-VST expansion, particularly in participants that demonstrated an exercise-induced increase in VST expansion. We conclude that exercise-induced enhancements in VST mobilization and expansion are at least partially β<sub>2</sub> AR mediated, thus highlighting a role for the β<sub>2</sub> AR in targeted therapy for the augmentation of VST immune cell therapeutics in the allogeneic adoptive transfer setting. Moreover, long-term regular exercise may provide additional viral protection in the host through frequent β<sub>2</sub> AR-dependent mobilization and redistribution of VSTs cumulated with each bout of exercise.","Kunz Hawley E, Agha Nadia H, Hussain Maryam, LaVoy Emily C, Smith Kyle A, Mylabathula Preteesh, Diak Douglass, Baker Forrest L, O'Connor Daniel P, Bond Richard A, Katsanis Emmanuel, Bollard Catherine M, Simpson Richard J",Cell stress & chaperones,"Adrenergic beta-1 Receptor Antagonists, Adrenergic beta-2 Receptor Antagonists, Adult, Antiviral Agents, Blood Pressure, Catecholamines, Cell Proliferation, Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy, Cytokines, Exercise, Female, Heart Rate, Humans, Hydrocortisone, Lactic Acid, Male, Peptides, Phenotype, Receptors, Adrenergic, beta, Species Specificity, T-Lymphocytes, Viruses, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32779001,"Laboratory of Integrated Physiology, Department of Health and Human Performance, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA. rjsimpson@email.arizona.edu.; College of Pharmacy, Science and Engineering Research Center, The University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA.; Department of Nutritional Sciences, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.; Center for Cancer and Immunology Research, Children's Research Institute, Children's National Health System and The George Washington University, Washington, D.C., USA.; Laboratory of Integrated Physiology, Department of Health and Human Performance, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.; Merced Experimental Social and Health Psychology Laboratory, Stress and Health Laboratory, Department of Psychological Sciences, University of California Merced, Merced, CA, USA."

In this preliminary investigation, we examined whether the benefits of propranolol are associated with functional properties in the brain. Adolescents/adults (mean age = 22.54 years) with (n = 13) and without autism spectrum disorder (n = 13) attended three sessions in which propranolol, nadolol (<i>beta-</i>adrenergic antagonist that does not cross the blood-brain barrier), or placebo was administered before a semantic fluency task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Autonomic nervous system measures and functional connectivity between language/associative processing regions and within the fronto-parietal control, dorsal attention, and default mode networks were examined. Propranolol was associated with improved semantic fluency performance, which was correlated with the baseline resting heart rate. Propranolol also altered network efficiency of regions associated with semantic processing and in an exploratory analysis reduced functional differences in the fronto-parietal control network in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Thus, the cognitive benefits from <i>beta-</i>adrenergic antagonism may be generally associated with improved information processing in the brain in domain-specific networks, but individuals with autism spectrum disorder may also benefit from additional improvements in domain-general networks. The benefits from propranolol may also be able to be predicted from baseline autonomic nervous system measures, which warrants further investigation.","Hegarty John P, Zamzow Rachel M, Ferguson Bradley J, Christ Shawn E, Porges Eric C, Johnson Jeffrey D, Beversdorf David Q",Autism : the international journal of research and practice,"Adolescent, Adrenergic beta-Antagonists, Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Brain, Brain Mapping, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Neural Pathways, Propranolol, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31416333,"University of Florida, USA.; University of Missouri, USA."

We determined the lymphocyte and monocyte subtypes mobilized to blood during exercise via β<sub>2</sub>-AR signaling whilst controlling for β<sub>1</sub>-AR mediated reductions in hemodynamic forces. In a randomized, double blind, complete cross-over design, 14 healthy cyclists exercised for 30-minutes at +10% of blood lactate threshold after ingesting: (1) a placebo, (2) a β<sub>1</sub>-preferential antagonist (10 mg bisoprolol), or (2) a non-preferential β<sub>1</sub> + β<sub>2</sub>-antagonist (80 mg nadolol) across three trials separated by >7-days. Bisoprolol was administered to reduce hemodynamic forces (heart rate and blood pressure) during exercise to levels comparable with nadolol but without blocking β<sub>2</sub>-ARs. The mobilization of total NK-cells, terminally differentiated (CD57+) NK-cells, central memory, effector memory and CD45RA+ effector memory CD8+ T-cells; non-classical monocytes; and γδ T-cells were significantly blunted or abrogated under nadolol compared to both bisoprolol and placebo, indicating that the exercise-induced mobilization of these cell types to the blood is largely influenced by β<sub>2</sub>-AR signaling. Nadolol failed to inhibit the mobilization of classical monocytes, CD4+ T-cells (and their subsets) or naïve CD8+ T-cells, indicating that these cell types are mobilized with exercise independently of the β<sub>2</sub>-AR. We conclude that the preferential mobilization of NK-cells, non-classical monocytes and differentiated subsets of CD8+ T-cells with exercise is largely dependent on catecholamine signaling through the β<sub>2</sub>-AR. These findings provide mechanistic insights by which distinct lymphocyte and monocyte subtypes are preferentially mobilized to protect the host from anticipated injury or infection in response to an acute stress response.","Graff Rachel M, Kunz Hawley E, Agha Nadia H, Baker Forrest L, Laughlin Mitzi, Bigley Austin B, Markofski Melissa M, LaVoy Emily C, Katsanis Emmanuel, Bond Richard A, Bollard Catherine M, Simpson Richard J","Brain, behavior, and immunity","Adult, Bisoprolol, CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes, Catecholamines, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Exercise, Female, Healthy Volunteers, Humans, Killer Cells, Natural, Lymphocyte Activation, Male, Monocytes, Nadolol, Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-2, Signal Transduction",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30172948,"Laboratory of Integrated Physiology, Department of Health and Human Performance, University of Houston, 3875 Holman Street, Houston, TX, USA.; Laboratory of Integrated Physiology, Department of Health and Human Performance, University of Houston, 3875 Holman Street, Houston, TX, USA; Department of Nutritional Sciences, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA; Department of Immunobiology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.; Laboratory of Integrated Physiology, Department of Health and Human Performance, University of Houston, 3875 Holman Street, Houston, TX, USA; Department of Nutritional Sciences, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA; Department of Immunobiology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA; Department of Behavioral Sciences, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.

Ligation sessions were repeated until response was achieved. The control group was treated with nadolol+nitrates+ligation. Between-group baseline characteristics were similar. During long-term follow-up (median of 24 months), mortality was lower in the HVPG-guided therapy group than in the control group (29% vs. 43%; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.35-0.99). Rebleeding occurred in 19% versus 31% of patients, respectively (HR = 0.53; 95% CI = 0.29-0.98), and further decompensation of cirrhosis occurred in 52% versus 72% (HR = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.46-0.99). The survival probability was higher with HVPG-guided therapy than in controls, both in acute (HR = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.32-1.08) and chronic nonresponders (HR = 0.48; 95% CI = 0.23-0.99). HVPG-guided patients had a greater reduction of HVPG and a lower final value than controls (P < 0.05). HVPG monitoring, by stratifying risk and targeting therapy, improves the survival achieved with currently recommended treatment to prevent VRB using β-blockers and ligation. HVPG-guided therapy achieved a greater reduction in PP, which may have contributed to reduce the risk of rebleeding and of further decompensation of cirrhosis, thus contributing to a better survival.

Noncardioselective β-blockers not only reduce portal hypertension and prevent variceal bleeding in cirrhosis but also impair glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in other settings. This study aimed to determine whether nonselective β-blockade with nadolol impairs glucose metabolism in liver cirrhosis. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of nadolol in cirrhotic patients examined insulin sensitivity, disposition index, and glucose tolerance. Stable cirrhotic patients of mixed etiology underwent an intravenous glucose tolerance test and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp for the measurement of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity (n = 16) and a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (n = 17). These measurements were conducted twice (after 3 months of treatment with nadolol or placebo and, after a 1-month washout period, after 3 months on the alternative treatment). Total body fat and plasma catecholamines were measured at the end of each 3-month treatment. Compared with placebo, nadolol treatment reduced insulin sensitivity (79.7 ± 10.1 vs 99.6 ± 10.3 μL/kg fat-free mass·min<sup>-1</sup> ·(mU/L)<sup>-1</sup> , P = .005).

Specifically, autistic people demonstrated hyperplasticity in response to theta-burst stimulation (TBS). We hypothesized that autistic adults would display hyperplasticity to TBS and that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) - which potentiates brain inhibitory mechanisms - would 'stabilize' hyperplasticity. Using a randomized, cross-over design, plasticity was assessed using TBS in the left motor cortex (M1) in 31 autistic adults and 30 sex-, intelligence quotient-, and age-matched controls. Autistic adults (n = 29) were further randomized (1:1) to receive a single session of active (n = 14) or sham (n = 15) rTMS (6000 pulses at 20 Hz) over left M1 and plasticity was reassessed on the next day following rTMS. Both long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) were significantly increased in the ASD group, indicating hyperplasticity. Active, but not sham rTMS, attenuated LTD in autistic adults. We provided further evidence for the presence of brain hyperplasticity in ASD. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show preliminary evidence that an excessive LTD in ASD can be 'stabilized' using rTMS. Such 'stabilizing' effect of rTMS on LTP was not observed, likely due to small sample size or a more specific 'attenuating' effect of rTMS on LTD, compared to LTP. These findings indicate atypical brain inhibitory mechanisms behind hyperplasticity in ASD. Utilizing a larger sample, future replication studies could investigate therapeutic opportunities of 'mechanism-driven' rTMS.","Desarkar Pushpal, Rajji Tarek K, Ameis Stephanie H, Blumberger Daniel M, Lai Meng-Chuan, Lunsky Yona, Daskalakis Zafiris J",Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology,"Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Cross-Over Studies, Female, Humans, Male, Motor Cortex, Neuronal Plasticity, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34011467,"Azrieli Adult Neurodevelopmental Centre, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Psychiatry, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; The Margaret and Wallace McCain Centre for Child, Youth & Family Mental Health, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada; Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Azrieli Adult Neurodevelopmental Centre, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Psychiatry, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Temerty Centre for Therapeutic Brain Intervention, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada; The Margaret and Wallace McCain Centre for Child, Youth & Family Mental Health, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada; Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Department of Psychiatry, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Temerty Centre for Therapeutic Brain Intervention, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada; Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Department of Psychiatry, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Temerty Centre for Therapeutic Brain Intervention, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada; Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Psychiatry, University of California San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA.; Azrieli Adult Neurodevelopmental Centre, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Psychiatry, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Azrieli Adult Neurodevelopmental Centre, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Psychiatry, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Temerty Centre for Therapeutic Brain Intervention, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada; Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada.

To conduct a pilot randomized, double-blind, parallel, controlled trial evaluating repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for EF deficits in ASD. In Toronto, Ontario (November 2014 to June 2017), a 20-session, 4-week course of 20 Hz rTMS targeting dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (90%RMT) was compared to sham stimulation in 16-35 year-olds with ASD (28 male/12 female), without intellectual disability, who had impaired everyday EF performance (n = 20 active/n = 20 sham). Outcome measures evaluated protocol feasibility and clinical effects of active vs. sham rTMS on EF performance. The moderating effect of baseline functioning was explored. Of eligible participants, 95% were enrolled and 95% of randomized participants completed the protocol. Adverse events across treatment arms were mild-to-moderate. There was no significant difference between active vs. sham rTMS on EF performance. Baseline adaptive functioning moderated the effect of rTMS, such that participants with lower baseline functioning experienced significant EF improvement in the active vs. sham group. Our pilot RCT demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of using high frequency rTMS targeting DLPFC in youth and young adults with autism. No evidence for efficacy of active versus sham rTMS on EF performance was found. However, we found promising preliminary evidence of EF performance improvement following active versus sham rTMS in participants with ASD with more severe adaptive functioning deficits.

Further, there are no effective, neuroscience-based treatments to address this impairing feature of ASD. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has demonstrated promise in addressing EF deficits in adult neuropsychiatric disorders. This article will outline the design of a novel randomized-controlled trial of bilateral, 20 Hz, rTMS applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for treatment of EF deficits in ASD that is currently ongoing. We describe prior therapeutic rTMS research for ASD and prior rTMS trials targeting EFs in adult neuropsychiatric disorders. A neurophysiological rationale for rTMS treatment of EF deficits in ASD is presented. An ongoing protocol will enroll participants aged 16-35 with ASD and no intellectual disability. Psychotropic medications will be continued during the 4-week trial of active 20 Hz versus sham rTMS applied to the DLPFC. Twenty, active treatment sessions consisting of 25 stimulation trains at a 90% motor threshold will be administered. The primary outcome measure is the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) spatial working memory task. At present, recruitment, enrollment, and treatment within the described clinical trial are ongoing. EF deficits are common and impairing symptoms of ASD.

Among associated symptoms of ASD, management of irritability has gained considerable attention as it complicates adjustment of ASD patients and thus necessitates its pharmacological treatment. Resveratrol is a plant phytoalexin, which has been demonstrated to have neuroprotective effects through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial was designed to assess the potential therapeutic effects of resveratrol plus risperidone on irritability of ASD patients. Sixty-two patients were assigned randomly into two groups of resveratrol and placebo. Both groups were treated with risperidone twice daily starting at a dose of 0.5 mg with a dose increase of 0.5 mg per week (for the first 3 weeks). Resveratrol dosage was 250 mg twice per day from the beginning of the study. Using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C), patients were assessed for ASD-related behavioural symptoms at baseline, week 5 and week 10. The frequency of adverse events was recorded using a checklist containing 25 possible side effects, including general, gastrointestinal, neurological and cardiovascular complications. Improvements in primary outcome measure (irritability) and three secondary outcome measures (lethargy/social withdrawal, stereotypic behaviour and inappropriate speech subscales) in the resveratrol group were statistically similar to those in the placebo group. The repeated measures analysis showed no time × treatment interaction on these subscale scores. In contrast, patients in the resveratrol group showed greater decline in hyperactivity/non-compliance score as a secondary outcome measure (mean difference [CI = 95%] = 4.51 [0.10-8.92], t = 2.04; P = .04), and repeated measures analysis showed significant effect for time × treatment effect on this subscale score (F = 3.81; df = 1.30; P = .043). There was no significant difference in number and severity of adverse events between the two groups.

Riluzole is hypothesized to have an inhibitory effect on glutamate release, block excitotoxic effects of glutamate, and potentiate postsynaptic GABA(A) receptor function. Extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) activation is known to be delayed in humans with FXS and knockout animal models of FXS. Correction of delayed ERK activation is a potential biomarker of treatment response in FXS. We conducted a six-week open-label prospective pilot study of riluzole (100 mg/day) in six adults with FXS. Riluzole was started at 50mg every evening and then increased to 50mg twice daily at week 2. The dose was kept constant for the final 4 weeks of the trial. Clinical response was determined by a score of 1 ""very much improved"" or 2 ""much improved"" on the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement (CGI-I) scale and a≥25% improvement on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for Pervasive Developmental Disorders. The primary target of treatment in this study was repetitive, compulsive behavior that commonly occurs in persons with FXS. The study incorporated an ERK activation biomarker assay. Potential adverse effects were assessed in a systematic manner at all clinic visits and by phone between visits. Riluzole treatment was associated with clinical response in 1 of 6 subjects (17%). Among a number of secondary outcome measures employed, significant improvement was only noted on the ADHD Rating Scale-IV (became non-significant when corrected for multiple comparisons).

When the clinical picture is sufficiently severe to warrant prescribing an atypical antipsychotic, PT is feasible for families of children with ADHD and co-occurring severe aggression. The promotion of attendance and engagement in PT is important to enhance clinical outcomes among this challenging population. Methods for overcoming barriers to participation in PT deserve vigorous investigation, particularly for those with low family income, non-white race, Hispanic ethnicity, or when children have lower cognitive level.","Joseph Heather M, Farmer Cristan, Kipp Heidi, Kolko David, Aman Michael, McGinley James, Arnold L Eugene, Gadow Kenneth D, Findling Robert L, Molina Brooke S G",Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology,"Aggression, Antipsychotic Agents, Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity, Attention Deficit and Disruptive Behavior Disorders, Central Nervous System Stimulants, Child, Combined Modality Therapy, Conduct Disorder, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Humans, Male, Parent-Child Relations, Parents, Risperidone, Severity of Illness Index, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592635,"6 Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.; 2 Office of the Clinical Director, Intramural Research Program, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.; 5 Department of Psychiatry, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York.; 1 Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.; 4 Vector Psychometric Group, LLC, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.; 3 Department of Psychiatry, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio."
29173736,10.1016/J.Jaac.2017.09.426,Clinical Implications From the Treatment of Severe Childhood Aggression (TOSCA) Study: A Re-Analysis and Integration of Findings.,2017-12-01,"The Treatment of Severe Childhood Aggression (TOSCA) project examined augmentation of stimulant treatment and parent training (PT) with risperidone for severe physical aggression. This article summarizes the clinical implications; reanalyzes the data to examine the utility of 4 criteria for deciding to augment; and presents a treatment algorithm. The newly analyzed 4 criteria for augmenting after 3 weeks of stimulant and PT treatment consisted of not meeting a Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) score of 1 and a normal score (≤15) on the Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form Disruptive-Total (D-Total); a CGI-I score of 1 or 2 plus 25% improvement in D-Total score; a D-Total score no higher than 15; and a CGI-Severity score of 3 (mild) or better. Effect sizes were calculated. Prior TOSCA publications were reviewed for clinically relevant findings. All 4 criteria resulted in medium or better effect sizes (d = 0.59-0.72) when comparing risperidone with placebo. Providing risperidone to children who did not reach a CGI-I score of 1 plus a D-Total score no higher than 15 resulted in the greatest benefit. In addition, a review of clinically relevant data suggests that stimulant plus PT shows further improvement after 3 weeks even without augmentation. For those children who did not attain a CGI-I score of 1 and a D-total score no higher than 15, adding risperidone maximized the number of children benefitting from treatment and the average amount of benefit. Unless clinical circumstances dictate otherwise, practitioners should delay an antipsychotic drug for at least 1 month after the optimal stimulant dose is achieved and PT has commenced.

An important clinical question is whether these favorable outcomes are maintained over longer times. Clinical responders to the 9-week trial (n = 103/168), defined as Clinical Global Impressions (CGI)-Improvement of much/very much improved plus substantial reduction in parent ratings of disruptiveness, were followed another 12 weeks (21 weeks total) while remaining on blinded treatment. Outcome measures included Clinical Global Impressions scale, Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form (NCBRF), other parent/teacher-rated scales, laboratory tests, clinician ratings of abnormal movement, and other adverse events (AEs). Parent ratings of problem behavior showed minimal worsening of behavior from end of the 9-week acute trial (expected from regression to the mean after selecting best responders), but outcomes at Extension endpoint were meaningfully improved compared with acute study baseline. As expected, outcomes for Basic and Augmented treatment did not differ among these children selected for good clinical response. During Extension, more Augmented subjects had elevated prolactin; there were no clinically confirmed cases of tardive dyskinesia. Delayed sleep onset was the most frequent Basic AE. We also conducted a last-observation-carried-forward analysis, which included both nonresponders and responders.

This study examined the effects of risperidone on cardiac conduction in children with ASD. Data were collected from an 8-week, five-site trial conducted by the Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology Autism Network. Children (age 5-17 years) were randomly assigned to risperidone (n = 49) or placebo (n = 52) under double-blind conditions. Risperidone was superior to placebo in reducing serious behavioral problems. A standard 12-lead, electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained in most subjects at screening and week 8. A pediatric electrophysiologist blind to treatment assignment reviewed all available ECGs for readability, abnormalities, and cardiac conduction parameters, including QTc. The electrophysiologist measurements were compared to machine readings. A second blinded electrophysiologist examined all available ECGs for abnormalities and a 20% random sample for QTc. Of the 101 randomized subjects in the trial, complete pretreatment and week 8 data were available on 65 subjects (placebo n = 30; risperidone n = 35). The electrophysiologist did not identify any cardiac conduction adverse effects of risperidone and there was no difference in mean change on the QTc compared to placebo. The Bland-Altman plot showed a systematic bias in QTc measurements by the electrophysiologist and machine. Machine readings produced higher values than the electrophysiologist for shorter QTc intervals and machine scoring was lower than electrophysiologist readings for longer QTc values (p = 0.001). Two electrophysiologists had overall percent agreements of 82.9% (95% CI: 76.3 to 89.6) on qualitative assessment and 88.6% (95% CI: 79.3 to 98.0) on QTc interval.

This was a 24-week, multisite, randomized trial of risperidone only versus risperidone plus parent training in 124 children (mean age 6.9 ± 2.35 years; 105 boys and 19 girls) with ASD and serious behavioral problems. We monitored height, weight, waist circumference, and adverse effects during the trial. Fasting blood samples were obtained before treatment and at week 16. In 97 children with a mean of 22.9 ± 2.8 weeks of risperidone exposure, there was a 5.4 ± 3.4 kg weight gain over 24 weeks (p < .0001); waist circumference increased from 60.7 ± 10.4 cm to 66.8 ± 11.3 cm (p < .0001). At baseline, 59 of 97 children (60.8%) were classified as having normal weight; by week 24, only 25 of 85 (29.4%) remained in that group. Growth curve analysis showed a significant change in body mass index (BMI) z scores from pretreatment to week 24 (p < .0001). This effect was significantly greater for children with reported increased appetite in the first 8 weeks. From before treatment to week 16, there were significant increases in glucose (p = .02), hemoglobin A1c (p = .01), insulin (p <.0001), homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; p < .001), alanine aminotransferase (p = .01), and leptin (p < .0001).

We examined the tolerability, safety, and therapeutic benefit of risperidone exposure over a 1-2 year follow-up period. In a naturalistic study, 84 children and adolescents 5-17 years of age (from an original sample of 101) were assessed an average of 21.4 months after initial entry into a placebo-controlled 8 week trial of risperidone for children and adolescents with autism and severe irritability. They were assessed at baseline and at follow-up on safety and tolerability measures (blood, urinalysis, electrocardiogram [ECG], medical history, vital signs, neurological symptoms, other adverse events), developmental measures (adaptive behavior, intelligence quotient [IQ]), and standardized rating instruments. Treatment over the follow-up period, after completion of protocol participation, was uncontrolled. Statistical analyses assessed outcome over time with or without prolonged risperidone therapy. Two-thirds of the 84 subjects continued to receive risperidone (mean 2.47 mg/day, S.D. 1.29 mg). At follow-up, risperidone was associated with more enuresis, more excessive appetite, and more weight gain, but not more adverse neurological effects. No clinically significant events were noted on blood counts, chemistries, urinalysis, ECG, or interim medical history. Regardless of drug condition at follow-up, there was considerable improvement in maladaptive behavior compared with baseline, including core symptoms associated with autism. Height and weight gains were elevated with risperidone. Social skills on Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS) improved with risperidone. Parent-rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) Irritability subscale scores were reduced in those taking risperidone at follow-up. Several other measures of maladaptive behavior (some related to socialization) also showed improved functioning in association with risperidone on the ABC or on the Modified Real Life Rating Scale. Increased appetite, weight gain, and enuresis are risks associated with long-term risperidone.

Here we asked whether risperidone-associated improvement was related to changes in concentrations of inflammatory molecules in the serum of these subjects. Seven molecules were identified as worthy of further assessment by performing a pilot analysis of 31 inflammatory markers in 21 medication-free subjects with autism versus 15 healthy controls: epidermal growth factor (EGF), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin (IL)-13, IL-17, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), IL-1 and IL-1-receptor antagonist. Serum concentrations of these markers were then established in a different set of subjects that participated in a double-blind, clinical trial and an expanded group of healthy subjects. In the first analysis, samples obtained from subjects with autism at baseline visits were compared to visits after 8-week treatment with placebo (n=37) or risperidone (n=40). The cytokine concentrations remained stable over the 8-week period for both risperidone and placebo groups. In the second analysis, we explored further the differences between medication-free subjects with autism (n=77) and healthy controls (recruited independently; n=19). Serum levels of EGF were elevated in subjects with autism (median=103 pg/mL, n=75) in comparison to healthy controls (75 pg/mL, n=19; p<0.05), and levels of IL-13 were decreased in autism (median=0.8 pg/mL, n=77) in comparison to controls (9.8 pg/mL, n=19; p=0.0003). These changes did not correlate with standardized measures used for a diagnosis of autism. In summary, risperidone-induced clinical improvement in subjects with autism was not associated with changes in the serum inflammatory markers measured. Whether altered levels of EGF and IL-13 play a role in the pathogenesis or phenotype of autism requires further investigation.","Tobiasova Zuzana, van der Lingen Klaas H B, Scahill Lawrence, Leckman James F, Zhang Yan, Chae Wookjin, McCracken James T, McDougle Christopher J, Vitiello Benedetto, Tierney Elaine, Aman Michael G, Arnold L Eugene, Katsovich Liliya, Hoekstra Pieter J, Volkmar Fred, Bothwell Alfred L M, Kawikova Ivana",Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology,"Adolescent, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Antipsychotic Agents, Autistic Disorder, Biomarkers, Child, Child, Preschool, Double-Blind Method, Epidermal Growth Factor, Female, Humans, Inflammation Mediators, Interleukin-13, Irritable Mood, Male, Risperidone",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22070180,"Department of Immunobiology, New Haven, CT 06520, USA."

Thus, medication and parent training target related, but separate, outcomes. At week 24, the medication was gradually withdrawn to determine whether subjects in the combined treatment group could be managed on a lower dose or off medication without relapse.

This sample of 38 was a subset of 101 subjects who participated in the clinical trial; 63 were unable to perform the cognitive tasks. A double-blind placebo-controlled parallel groups design was used. Dependent measures included tests of sustained attention, verbal learning, hand-eye coordination, and spatial memory assessed before, during, and after the 8-week treatment. Changes in performance were compared by repeated measures ANOVA. Twenty-nine boys and 9 girls with autism and severe behavioral disturbance and a mental age >or=18 months completed the cognitive part of the study. No decline in performance occurred with risperidone. Performance on a cancellation task (number of correct detections) and a verbal learning task (word recognition) was better on risperidone than on placebo (without correction for multiplicity).

Previous clinical trials of oral SF demonstrated positive clinical effects on behavior in young men and changes in urinary metabolomics in children with ASD. We conducted a 15-week randomized parallel double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial with 15-week open-label treatment and 6-week no-treatment extensions in 57 children, ages 3-12 years, with ASD over 36 weeks. Twenty-eight were assigned SF and 29 received placebo (PL). Clinical effects, safety and tolerability of SF were measured as were biomarkers to elucidate mechanisms of action of SF in ASD. Data from 22 children taking SF and 23 on PL were analyzed. Treatment effects on the primary outcome measure, the Ohio Autism Clinical Impressions Scale (OACIS), in the general level of autism were not significant between SF and PL groups at 7 and 15 weeks. The effect sizes on the OACIS were non-statistically significant but positive, suggesting a possible trend toward greater improvement in those on treatment with SF (Cohen's d 0.21; 95% CI - 0.46, 0.88 and 0.10; 95% CI - 0.52, 0.72, respectively).

Ratings on the ABC and SRS-2 improved with a non-randomized analysis of the length of exposure to SF, compared to the pre-treatment baseline (p < 0.001).

The sample size was limited to 45 children with ASD and we did not impute missing data. We were unable to document significant changes in clinical assessments during clinical visits in those taking SF compared to PL. The clinical results were confounded by placebo effects during the open-label phase. SF led to small yet non-statistically significant changes in the total and all subscale scores of the primary outcome measure, while for secondary outcome measures, caregivers' assessments of children taking SF showed statistically significant improvements compared to those taking PL on the ABC but not the SRS-2.

The medico-economic burdens of ASD are enormous, and no recognized treatment targets the core features of ASD. In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial, young men (aged 13-27) with moderate to severe ASD received the phytochemical sulforaphane (n = 29)--derived from broccoli sprout extracts--or indistinguishable placebo (n = 15). The effects on behavior of daily oral doses of sulforaphane (50-150 µmol) for 18 wk, followed by 4 wk without treatment, were quantified by three widely accepted behavioral measures completed by parents/caregivers and physicians: the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), and Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale (CGI-I). Initial scores for ABC and SRS were closely matched for participants assigned to placebo and sulforaphane. After 18 wk, participants receiving placebo experienced minimal change (<3.3%), whereas those receiving sulforaphane showed substantial declines (improvement of behavior): 34% for ABC (P < 0.001, comparing treatments) and 17% for SRS scores (P = 0.017). On CGI-I, a significantly greater number of participants receiving sulforaphane had improvement in social interaction, abnormal behavior, and verbal communication (P = 0.015-0.007). Upon discontinuation of sulforaphane, total scores on all scales rose toward pretreatment levels. Dietary sulforaphane, of recognized low toxicity, was selected for its capacity to reverse abnormalities that have been associated with ASD, including oxidative stress and lower antioxidant capacity, depressed glutathione synthesis, reduced mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation, increased lipid peroxidation, and neuroinflammmation.","Singh Kanwaljit, Connors Susan L, Macklin Eric A, Smith Kirby D, Fahey Jed W, Talalay Paul, Zimmerman Andrew W",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"Adolescent, Adult, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Humans, Isothiocyanates, Male, Placebos, Social Behavior, Sulfoxides, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25313065,"Lurie Center for Autism, Department of Pediatrics, Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, Harvard Medical School, Lexington, MA 02421;; McKusick-Nathans Institute for Genetic Medicine and.; Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Lewis B. and Dorothy Cullman Chemoprotection Center, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205 ptalalay@jhmi.edu Andrew.Zimmerman@umassmemorial.org.; Lurie Center for Autism, Department of Pediatrics, Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, Harvard Medical School, Lexington, MA 02421; Department of Pediatrics (Neurology), University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01655;; Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Lewis B. and Dorothy Cullman Chemoprotection Center, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205.; Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital Biostatistics Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114; and.; Lurie Center for Autism, Department of Pediatrics, Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, Harvard Medical School, Lexington, MA 02421; Department of Pediatrics (Neurology), University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01655; ptalalay@jhmi.edu Andrew.Zimmerman@umassmemorial.org."

Topiramate has attracted considerable attention as a treatment for the dependence on alcohol and stimulants. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of topiramate for methamphetamine dependence. This study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. In the present investigation, 62 methamphetamine-dependent adults were enrolled and randomized into two groups, and received topiramate or a placebo for 10 weeks in escalating doses from 50 mg/day to the target maintenance dose of 200 mg/day. Addiction severity index (ASI) and craving scores were registered every week. The Beck questionnaire was also given to each participant at baseline and every 2 weeks during the treatment. Urine samples were collected at baseline and every 2 weeks during the treatment. Fifty-seven patients completed 10 weeks of the trial. There was no significant difference between both groups in the mean percentage of prescribed capsules taken by the participants. At week six, the topiramate group showed a significantly lower proportion of methamphetamine-positive urine tests in comparison with the placebo group (P = 0.01). In addition, there were significantly lower scores in the topiramate group in comparison with the placebo group in two domains of ASI: drug use severity (P < 0.001) and drug need (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the craving score (duration) significantly declined in the topiramate patients compared to those receiving the placebo. In conclusion, the results of this trial suggest that topiramate may be beneficial for the treatment of methamphetamine dependence.","Rezaei Farzin, Ghaderi Ebrahim, Mardani Roya, Hamidi Seiran, Hassanzadeh Kambiz",Fundamental & clinical pharmacology,"Adult, Amphetamine-Related Disorders, Central Nervous System Stimulants, Disease Management, Double-Blind Method, Follow-Up Studies, Fructose, Humans, Iran, Male, Methamphetamine, Pilot Projects, Topiramate",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26751259,"Social Determinants of Health Research Center, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Pasdaran Blvd, Sanandaj, Iran.; Ghods Hospital, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Pasdaran Blvd, Sanandaj, Iran.; Student Research Committee, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Pasdaran Blvd, Sanandaj, Iran.; Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Pasdaran Blvd, Sanandaj, Iran."

Rett syndrome is a chronic disorder requiring long-term treatment. We report the efficacy and safety results of LILAC, a 40-week, open-label extension study of LAVENDER. Females with Rett syndrome aged 5-21 years received open-label treatment with trofinetide for 40 weeks. The primary endpoint was long-term safety of trofinetide; secondary endpoints included the change from baseline at week 40 in the Rett Syndrome Behaviour Questionnaire score and the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement score at week 40. Overall, 154 participants were enrolled and treated with trofinetide in LILAC. The most common adverse events in LILAC were diarrhea (74.7%), vomiting (28.6%), and COVID-19 (11.0%). Diarrhea was the most common adverse event leading to treatment withdrawal (21.4%). The Rett Syndrome Behaviour Questionnaire mean score (standard error) improvement from the LAVENDER baseline to week 40 in LILAC was -7.3 (1.62) and -7.0 (1.61) for participants treated with trofinetide and placebo in LAVENDER, respectively. Mean Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scores (standard error) at week 40 rated from the LILAC baseline were 3.1 (0.11) and 3.2 (0.14) for participants treated with trofinetide and placebo in LAVENDER, respectively.

In this prospective double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 30 subjects (20 boys, 10 girls) 6-20 years of age with PDD and significant aggression were randomized and received treatment with valproate (VPA) or placebo (PBO) for 8 weeks as outpatients. Mean VPA trough blood levels were 75.5 mcg/mL at week 4 and 77.8 mcg/mL at week 8. No treatment difference was observed statistically between VPA and PBO groups. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist--Community Scale (ABC-C) Irritability subscale was the primary outcome measure (p = 0.65), and CGI--Improvement (p = 0.16) and OAS (p = 0.96) were secondary outcome measures. Increased appetite and skin rash were significant side effects. Only 1 subject was dropped from the study owing to side effects, notably a spreading skin rash, which then resolved spontaneously. Two subjects receiving VPA developed increased serum ammonia levels, one with an associated parent report of slurred speech and mild cognitive slowing. Poststudy, of 16 VPA and PBO subjects receiving VPA, 10 subjects demonstrated sustained response, 4 of whom later attempted taper, with significant relapse of aggression. The present negative findings cannot be viewed as conclusive, partly owing to the large placebo response, subject heterogeneity, and size of the groups.

32121236,10.3390/Nu12030661,Inflammation (IL-1β) Modifies the Effect of Vitamin D and Omega-3 Long Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids on Core Symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder-An Exploratory Pilot Study<sup>‡</sup>.,2020-02-28,"The role of vitamin D and omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 LCPUFA) in improving core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children has been investigated by a few randomised controlled trials and the results are mixed and inconclusive. The response to treatment with these nutrients is heterogenous and may be influenced by inflammatory state. As an exploratory analysis, we investigated whether inflammatory state would modulate the effect of these nutrients on core symptoms of ASD. Methods<i>:</i> Seventy-three New Zealand children with ASD (2.5-8.0 years) completed a 12-month randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D (VID, 2000 IU/day), omega-3 LCPUFA; (OM, 722 mg/day docosahexaenoic acid), or both (VIDOM). Non-fasting baseline plasma interleukin-1β (IL-1β) was available for 67 children (VID = 15, OM = 21, VIDOM = 15, placebo = 16). Children were categorised as having undetectable/normal IL-1β (<3.2 pg/ml, <i>n</i>=15) or elevated IL-1β (≥3.2 pg/mL, <i>n</i> = 52). The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) questionnaire was used to assess core symptoms of ASD (baseline, 12-month). Mixed model repeated measure analyses (including all children or only children with elevated IL-1β) were used. We found evidence for an interaction between baseline IL-1β and treatment response for SRS-total, SRS-social communicative functioning, SRS-awareness and SRS-communication (all <i>P</i><sub>interaction</sub> < 0.10). When all children were included in the analysis, two outcome comparisons (treatments vs. placebo) showed greater improvements: VID, no effect (all <i>P</i> > 0.10); OM and VIDOM (<i>P</i> = 0.01) for SRS-awareness. When only children with elevated IL-1β were included, five outcomes showed greater improvements: OM (<i>P</i> = 0.01) for SRS-total; OM (<i>P</i> = 0.03) for SRS-social communicative functioning; VID (<i>P</i> = 0.01), OM (<i>P</i> = 0.003) and VIDOM (<i>P</i> = 0.01) for SRS-awareness.

Because pharmacological treatments may have adverse effects, and despite limited evidence, caregivers/parents often use dietary supplements such as vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids to address these behavioural symptoms. As a secondary objective of the VIDOMA (Vitamin D and Omega-3 in ASD) trial, we evaluated the efficacy of vitamin D, omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid [omega-3 LCPUFA; docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)], or both on irritability and hyperactivity. New Zealand children with ASD (aged 2.5-8 years) participated in a 12-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D (2000 IU/day, VID), omega-3 LCPUFA (722 mg/day DHA, OM), or both (2000 IU/day vitamin D + 722 mg/day DHA, VIDOM). The primary outcomes were the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist (ABC) domains of irritability and hyperactivity. Biomarkers (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and omega-3 index) and primary outcomes were measured at baseline and 12-months. Out of 111 children who completed baseline data collection, 66% completed the study (VID = 19, OM = 23, VIDOM = 15, placebo = 16). After 12 months, children receiving OM (-5.0 ± 5.0, P = 0.001) and VID (-4.0±4.9, P = 0.01) had greater reduction in irritability than placebo (0.8±6.1). Compared to placebo, children on VID also had greater reduction in hyperactivity (-5.2±6.3 vs. -0.8±5.6, P = 0.047). Serum 25(OH)D concentration (nmol/L, mean±SD) increased by 27±14 in VID and by 36±17 in VIDOM groups (P < 0.0001), and omega-3 index (%, median (25th, 75th percentiles)) by 4.4 (3.3, 5.9) in OM and by 4.0 (2.0, 6.0) in VIDOM groups (P < 0.0001), indicating a good compliance rate.

However, there are no trials that have measured the effect of both vitamin D and n-3 LCPUFA supplementation on autism severity symptoms. The objective of this 2 × 2 factorial trial is to investigate the effect of vitamin D, n-3 LCPUFAs or a combination of both on core symptoms of ASD. Children with ASD living in New Zealand (n = 168 children) will be randomised to one of four treatments daily: vitamin D (2000 IU), n-3 LCPUFAs (722 mg DHA), vitamin D (2000 IU) + n-3 LCPUFAs (722 mg DHA) or placebo for 12 months. All researchers, participants and their caregivers will be blinded until the data analysis is completed, and randomisation of the active/placebo capsules and allocation will be fully concealed from all mentioned parties. The primary outcome measures are the change in social-communicative functioning, sensory processing issues and problem behaviours between baseline and 12 months. A secondary outcome measure is the effect on gastrointestinal symptoms. Baseline data will be used to assess and correct basic nutritional deficiencies prior to treatment allocation. For safety measures, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D 25(OH)D and calcium will be monitored at baseline, 6 and 12 months, and weekly compliance and gastrointestinal symptom diaries will be completed by caregivers throughout the study period. To our knowledge there are no randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of both vitamin D and DHA supplementation on core symptoms of ASD. If it is shown that either vitamin D, DHA or both are effective, the trial would reveal a non-invasive approach to managing ASD symptoms.

Two groups of trials were conducted using either Acunil or a placebo (control). Animals (Acunil: n = 17; placebo: n = 12) were observed for a 12-hr period before the administration of Acunil or the placebo (pretreatment). After 24 hr, animals were administered Acunil (1.5 mg/kg) or a placebo (1.0-3.0 ml of sterile water) and observed again for 12 hr (posttreatment). During both treatments, animals were stimulated every 2 hr for 1 min by a person entering the enclosure (referred to as periods of stimulation). Behavioral observations and continuous heart rate, respiration rate, and motion measurements were taken throughout. Animals treated with Acunil spent more time lying with their heads folded back, eating and standing with their heads down, and less time being vigilant and exploring while walking around. Animals treated with the placebo also spent less time being vigilant and more time lying with heads up. Animals treated with Acunil groomed less while standing and performed less head shaking; no such changes were observed in the control group. Neither Acunil nor the placebo had any effect (P > 0.05) on heart rate. However, overall mean respiration rate was lowered (P = 0.02) when animals were treated with Acunil (pretreatment: 14.5 ± 0.82 breaths/min; posttreatment: 12.5 ± 0.83 breaths/min). Acunil also caused a lowered (P < 0.05) respiration rate during periods when animals were stimulated (pretreatment: 16.2 ± 0.87 breaths/min; posttreatment: 13.7 ± 0.87 breaths/min) and when animals were trotting and being vigilant.

Here, we examined the effect of dopamine D2/3 receptor blockade on cognition. Additionally, we explored the relation between frontal D2/3 receptor availability and treatment effect on positive symptoms. Twenty-five antipsychotic-naïve first-episode schizophrenia patients were examined with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, tested with the cognitive test battery Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery, scanned with single-photon emission computerized tomography using the dopamine D2/3 receptor ligand [(123)I]epidepride, and scanned with MRI. After 3 months of treatment with either risperidone (n=13) or zuclopenthixol (n=9), 22 patients were reexamined. Blockade of extrastriatal dopamine D2/3 receptors was correlated with decreased attentional focus (r = -0.615, P=.003) and planning time (r = -0.436, P=.048). Moreover, baseline frontal dopamine D2/3 binding potential and positive symptom reduction correlated positively (D2/3 receptor binding potential left frontal cortex rho = 0.56, P=.003; D2/3 receptor binding potential right frontal cortex rho = 0.48, P=.016). Our data support the hypothesis of a negative influence of D2/3 receptor blockade on specific cognitive functions in schizophrenia. This is highly clinically relevant given the well-established association between severity of cognitive disturbances and a poor functional outcome in schizophrenia. Additionally, the findings support associations between frontal D2/3 receptor binding potential at baseline and the effect of antipsychotic treatment on positive symptoms.","Nørbak-Emig Henrik, Ebdrup Bjørn H, Fagerlund Birgitte, Svarer Claus, Rasmussen Hans, Friberg Lars, Allerup Peter N, Rostrup Egill, Pinborg Lars H, Glenthøj Birte Y",The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology,"Adult, Antipsychotic Agents, Attention, Clopenthixol, Cognition, Denmark, Dopamine Antagonists, Female, Frontal Lobe, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Molecular Imaging, Receptors, Dopamine D2, Receptors, Dopamine D3, Risperidone, Schizophrenia, Schizophrenic Psychology, Time Factors, Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26819282,"Center for Neuropsychiatric Schizophrenia Research & Center for Clinical Intervention and Neuropsychiatric Schizophrenia Research, Copenhagen University Hospital, Mental Health Centre Glostrup, Mental Health Services, Capital Region of Denmark, Glostrup, Denmark (Drs Nørbak-Emig, Ebdrup, Fagerlund, Rasmussen, and Glenthøj); University of Copenhagen, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, Department of Clinical Medicine, Copenhagen, Denmark (Drs Nørbak-Emig and Glenthøj); Neurobiology Research Unit and Epilepsy Clinic, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark (Drs Svarer and Pinborg); Department of Education, Centre for Research in Compulsory Schooling, Aarhus University, Denmark (Dr Allerup); Functional Imaging Unit, Department of Diagnostics, Copenhagen University Hospital, Glostrup Hospital, Denmark (Dr Rostrup); Department of Clinical Physiology and Nuclear Medicine, Copenhagen University, Bispebjerg Hospital, Denmark (Dr Friberg). birte.glenthoj@cnsr.dk.; Center for Neuropsychiatric Schizophrenia Research & Center for Clinical Intervention and Neuropsychiatric Schizophrenia Research, Copenhagen University Hospital, Mental Health Centre Glostrup, Mental Health Services, Capital Region of Denmark, Glostrup, Denmark (Drs Nørbak-Emig, Ebdrup, Fagerlund, Rasmussen, and Glenthøj); University of Copenhagen, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, Department of Clinical Medicine, Copenhagen, Denmark (Drs Nørbak-Emig and Glenthøj); Neurobiology Research Unit and Epilepsy Clinic, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark (Drs Svarer and Pinborg); Department of Education, Centre for Research in Compulsory Schooling, Aarhus University, Denmark (Dr Allerup); Functional Imaging Unit, Department of Diagnostics, Copenhagen University Hospital, Glostrup Hospital, Denmark (Dr Rostrup); Department of Clinical Physiology and Nuclear Medicine, Copenhagen University, Bispebjerg Hospital, Denmark (Dr Friberg)."

One reason for therapeutic failure or adverse effects is caused by genetic variations in the cytochrome P450 drug-metabolizing genes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of CYP2D6 polymorphisms on steady-state serum concentrations of antipsychotics metabolized by CYP2D6, taking into account the co-medication with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Serum and EDTA samples were collected from 82 psychiatric patients. After a liquid-liquid extraction, serum samples were analyzed using an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (UHPLC-MS/MS) method for quantification of the antipsychotics. CYP2D6 genotyping was performed using the Luminex xTAG® CYP2D6 Kit v3 (Luminex Corporation). Patients were divided into five phenotype subgroups by calculation of the activity score (AS): poor metabolizers (PM; AS 0), intermediate metabolizers (IM; AS 0.5-1), extensive metabolizers with slow activity (EM-s; AS 1-1.5), extensive metabolizers with fast activity (EM-f; AS 2), and ultra-rapid metabolizers (UM; AS >2). The influence of the phenotypes on the concentration-to-dose and metabolite-to-parent ratios was evaluated. Overall, 6.1 % UM (n = 5), 25.6 % EM-f (n = 21), 46.3 % EM-s (n = 38), 1.2 % EM-s/EM-f (n = 1), 6.1 % IM (n = 5), and 14.6 % PM (n = 12) were found, taking co-administration of strong and moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors into account (phenoconversion). It was demonstrated that CYP2D6 polymorphisms affect the serum concentrations of aripiprazole (n = 18), haloperidol (n = 11), risperidone (n = 20), and zuclopenthixol (n = 6), while no influence was seen on the paliperidone serum concentrations (n = 31). Even with a small number of patients per antipsychotic, the importance of CYP2D6 genotyping was still clearly stated.

Our secondary hypothesis was that the usual doses of zuclopenthixol and/or clonazepam would decrease in the venlafaxine-treated group. In a randomized double-blind study, we compared six patients who received venlafaxine along with their usual treatment (zuclopenthixol and/or clonazepam) with seven patients who received placebo plus usual care. Irritability, hyperactivity/noncompliance, and overall clinical improvement were measured after 2 and 8 weeks, using validated clinical scales. Univariate analyses showed that the symptom of irritability improved in the entire sample (p = 0.023 after 2 weeks, p = 0.061 at study endpoint), although no difference was observed between the venlafaxine and placebo groups. No significant decrease in hyperactivity/noncompliance was observed during the study. At the end of the study, global improvement was observed in 33% of participants treated with venlafaxine and in 71% of participants in the placebo group (p = 0.29). The study found that decreased cumulative doses of clonazepam and zuclopenthixol were required for the venlafaxine group. Multivariate analyses (principal component analyses) with at least three combinations of variables showed that the two populations could be clearly separated (p b 0.05). Moreover, in all cases, the venlafaxine population had lower values for the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Behavior Problems Inventory (BPI), and levels of urea with respect to the placebo group. In one case, a reduction in the dosage of clonazepam was also suggested. For an additional set of variables (ABC factor 2, BPI frequency of aggressive behaviors, hematic ammonia at Day 28, and zuclopenthixol and clonazepam intake), the separation between the two samples was statistically significant as was the Bartlett's test, but the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy was below the accepted threshold. This set of variables showed a reduction in the cumulative intake of both zuclopenthixol and clonazepam. Despite the small sample sizes, this study documented a statistically significant effect of venlafaxine.

Psychopharmacological treatment is mostly studied with new-generation antipsychotics and has been criticized for adverse side effects. This study examined the effect of the classic antipsychotic zuclopenthixol. A total of 39 boys (ages 8.0-17.11 years) with learning disabilities were included and examined for a response to zuclopenthixol during a 6 week period of open label treatment. Doses started low and were adapted individually. From responders, zuclopenthixol was randomly withdrawn for 12 weeks. Responses to withdrawal were observed by external raters using the Modified Overt Aggression Scale. Of all patients included into the study, 15 were not randomized because of insufficient therapeutic effect, adverse event, or noncompliance. Kaplan-Meier estimations showed less aggressive behavior problems for the continuing subgroup (n=9) than in the placebo group (n=15). Individual doses stayed <10 mg/day.

The current study was a cross-sectional study based on the baseline survey of the West China Health and Aging Trend (WCHAT) study. A total of 3713 participants aged ≥ 50y were included in our study. Sarcopenia was defined according to the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) 2019 consensus. Obesity was defined by body mass index (BMI) (≥ 28 kg/m2) and body fat mass percentage (≥ 60th percentile in each sex group). 25-hydroxyvitamin D was measured by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay and PA was evaluated by a validated China Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire (CLTPAQ). Multinomial logistic regression was performed to examine the relationship between PA, vitamin D and sarcopenia and obesity. Low PA was significantly associated with higher odds of sarcopenia in women only (OR = 1.70,95%CI:1.18,2.46, p < 0.01).

The Part C Early Intervention (EI) system, which is publicly funded and available in all U.S. states, offers an optimal infrastructure through which toddlers can receive NDBIs. This study seeks to assess the effectiveness and fit of one NDBI, Caregiver Implemented Reciprocal Imitation Teaching (CI-RIT), within the Part C EI system. This hybrid type 1 effectiveness/implementation trial uses a multi-site randomized control design to simultaneously test effectiveness and collect implementation data on CI-RIT in the Part C EI system across four states: Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan and Washington. Participants include EI providers (target n = 160) who are randomized to either CI-RIT or treatment as usual (TAU), and child/caregiver dyads on their caseloads (target n = 440). Primary effectiveness outcomes focus on (1) child social communication, joint attention, motor imitation; and (2) caregiver responsivity, implementation fidelity of RIT, and self-efficacy, which are all measured at baseline and then 4-months and 9-months after baseline. Implementation outcomes include CI-RIT modifications, treatment acceptability, fidelity of CI-RIT coaching, and RIT session completion. This study represents a critical effort to transport an evidence-based NDBI, CI-RIT, into a national service delivery setting, the Part C EI system. The large, multi-site nature of the trial provides the opportunity to address critical questions about training and intervention effectiveness, which will, in turn, optimize and support CI-RIT implementation at scale.

Previous research indicates that ASD without intellectual impairment is associated with underactivity and reduced functional connectivity of the brain's mentalizing pathway, to which the right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ) serves as an important entry point and hub. In this study, we aim to utilize functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to localize activation maxima in the rTPJ and other regions involved in social cognition to generate individualized targets for neuro-navigated, intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) in order to modulate brain activity in a region centrally engaged in social information processing. In this single-blind, randomized, between-subject neuroimaging-guided brain stimulation study we plan to recruit 52 participants with prediagnosed ASD and 52 controls without ASD aged between 18 and 65 years. Participants will be classified into two groups and will randomly receive one session of either verum- or sham-iTBS. Effects will be assessed by using well-established experimental tasks that interrogate social behaviour, but also use computational modelling to investigate brain stimulation effects at this level. This study aims to use personalized, non-invasive brain stimulation to alter social information processing in adults with and without high-functioning ASD, which has not been studied before with a similar protocol or a sample size of this magnitude. By doing so in combination with behavioural and computational tasks, this study has the potential to provide new mechanistic insights into the workings of the social brain.

Growing evidence suggests that alterations in brain networks may contribute to ASD symptoms. The cerebellum, with its widespread connections to the cortex, has emerged as a potential key player in ASD. Non-invasive neuromodulation techniques, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) offer a promising avenue for modulating brain activity and potentially alleviating ASD symptoms. In addition, preclinical studies in rodents further emphasize the therapeutic effect of cerebellar stimulation to target autism-related symptoms. This article reviews both clinical and preclinical studies aiming to modulate cerebellar circuits to improve symptoms of ASD. We found ten relevant studies assessing the effect of cerebellar neuromodulation in human and preclinical models. Posterior cerebellar tDCS represented the most frequent neuromodulation method and suggested that cerebellar tDCS can lead to improvements in symptoms of ASD and restore cerebellar connectivity in individuals with ASD. In neurotypical participants, there is evidence that cerebellar tDCS can enhance social cognitive abilities. These results are in line with preclinical studies, suggesting that chemogenetic stimulation can modulate cerebellar circuits involved in ASD and improve related behaviors. Further research is needed to establish standardized protocols, assess long-term effects, and investigate the underlying mechanisms of cerebellar stimulation.

However, initial single-dose and multiple-dose trials showed mixed results, with some demonstrating improvements in social and repetitive behavior and others showing no benefit over placebo. This perspective aims to elucidate factors contributing to this variability and to highlight pitfalls and opportunities in the field. We identified two major factors: design-related elements and individual participant characteristics. Pertaining to design-related elements, optimal dosing regimens have yet to be established, but appear to favor moderate intervention durations (i.e., 4-6 weeks) with intermittent and intermediate dosing (i.e., 24-32 IU every other day). Also, the context of the intervention seems crucial, as enhanced outcomes are mainly observed when oxytocin administration is paired with a socially stimulating and supporting environment. In addition, more adequate outcome measures have to be established to effectively assess oxytocin's impact, including behavioral scales and objective biophysiological markers tapping into stress and neurophysiological regulation. Future research should also account for individual participant differences in biological sex, developmental stage and cognitive and adaptive functioning, and incorporate (epi)genetic screening to identify responders. Overall, refining study designs and personalizing intervention protocols are essential for optimizing oxytocin's prosocial and anxiolytic effect in autism.","Ricchiuti Grazia, Tuerlinckx Elise, Taillieu Aymara, Prinsen Jellina, Steyaert Jean, Boets Bart, Alaerts Kaat","Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)","Oxytocin, Humans, Administration, Intranasal, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Social Behavior, Autistic Disorder, Animals",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39861928,"Leuven Autism Research (LAuRes), KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.; Neuromodulation Laboratory, Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium."

We begin by reviewing several mechanisms by which nutrients maximize brain health, including enabling metabolic reactions to occur, supporting mitochondrial function, reducing inflammation and assisting with detoxification. Circumstances that may contribute to an individual requiring additional nutrients beyond what are available in the diet, such as consumption of nutritionally depleted food, individual differences in biological need, long-term medication use and gut-brain health needs are then reviewed. These factors underpin the importance of tackling deficiencies relative to individual metabolic requirements with a broad spectrum of micronutrients, as opposed to a single nutrient approach, to address personal metabolic needs and/or environmentally induced nutrient depletions. The evidence for treating psychological symptoms with supplementary micronutrients is presented, summarizing research using broad-spectrum micronutrients in the treatment of mental health issues including aggression, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and emotional dysregulation, often with medium between-group effect sizes compared with placebo, with clinically meaningful changes. The breadth and consistency of the findings highlight the importance of receiving a complete foundation of nutrients to optimize brain health; however, the small number of studies identifies the importance of future work to replicate these preliminary findings. Documented safety in 8-week randomized controlled trials with open-label extensions up to 16 weeks and longer-term follow-up for 1.5-5 years in smaller samples provide reassurance that this treatment approach does not result in serious adverse events.

We searched multiple electronic databases up to January 24, 2024. Meta-analyzable data from RCTs in the retrieved SRs/MAs were pooled using Metaumbrella. Primary outcomes were subjective/objective child sleep parameters. Additional outcomes included child health/functioning and parental sleep/health. The quality of the MAs/SRs was assessed with Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR-2), and the certainty of evidence using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE). We included 93 SRs/MAs covering 393 RCTs, with 25 (17%, 39%, and 30%: high, moderate, and low quality) providing data for quantitative synthesis. Behavioral interventions, usually multicomponent including parent training, psychoeducation, and/or specific sleep therapy/strategies, showed beneficial effects on night waking, sleep duration, overall sleep disturbance, mood/depression, and maternal sleep quality (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.10-0.80) in participants with sleep problems without a formal sleep disorder diagnosis. For those with a formal diagnosis (mainly insomnia), benefits were found for night waking, sleep efficiency (subjective/actigraphically measured), and sleep onset latency (mean SMD = 0.49-0.97). Those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) improved in bedtime resistance, night waking, parasomnias, sleep anxiety, ADHD symptoms, sleep disturbance, and quality of life (mean SMD = 0.18-0.49). For those with autism, sleep disturbance improved (mean SMD = 0.70). However, all findings were of low to very low certainty of evidence. Among nonpharmacological interventions for sleep difficulties in youth, only behavioral interventions are supported by meta-analytic evidence, yet with small-to-moderate effect sizes and limited certainty of evidence. This ""umbrella review"" (a review of reviews) analyzed 93 systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials examining nonmedication sleep interventions for children and adolescents. The authors found that behavioral interventions, including parent training and psychoeducation, had positive effects on sleep issues like night waking, with effect sizes ranging from small to moderate.

Within the tactile domain, atypical tactile reactivity (TR) is common, it emerges early, persists into adulthood, and impedes social interaction and daily functioning. Hence, atypical TR is a key target for biological intervention to improve outcomes. Brain mechanisms informing biological interventions for atypical TR remains elusive. We previously reported hyper-plasticity in the motor cortex in autistic adults and found that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), designed to strengthen inhibitory processes in the brain, reduced hyper-plasticity. Whether the primary sensory cortex (S1) is characterized by hyper-plasticity, which may underlie atypical TR in autism is unknown. We aim to test whether hyper-plasticity in the S1 underlies atypical TR in autism, and investigate if a single session of rTMS can safely reduce hyper-plasticity in S1 in autistic adults. Plasticity will be assessed in the left S1 with integrated paired associative stimulation and electroencephalography (PAS-EEG) paradigm in 32 autistic adults and 32 age-, sex-, and intelligence quotient-matched controls. Autistic participants will be further randomized (double-blind, 1:1) to receive a single-session of either sham or active 20 Hz bilateral rTMS over the S1 and the plasticity will be re-assessed over the left S1 on the same day. Atypical TR has been identified as one of the top clinical research priorities that can influence outcome in autistic population. The study findings can be highly valuable to further elucidate the mechanism underlying atypical TR, which in turn can help with developing a mechanism-driven intervention.","Kariminezhad Shohreh, Zomorrodi Reza, Zrenner Christoph, Blumberger Daniel M, Ameis Stephanie H, Lin Hsiang-Yuan, Lai Meng-Chuan, Rajji Tarek K, Lunsky Yona, Sanches Marcos, Desarkar Pushpal",PloS one,"Adolescent, Adult, Female, Humans, Male, Young Adult, Autistic Disorder, Double-Blind Method, Electroencephalography, Neuronal Plasticity, Somatosensory Cortex, Touch, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39591434,"Azrieli Adult Neurodevelopmental Centre, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Temerty Centre for Therapeutic Brain Intervention, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Biostatistical Core, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."

While international evidence suggests that social skills group training (SSGT) programmes can support autistic children, improving their psychosocial functioning, to date there is no standardised evidence-based SSGT tailored towards the needs of autistic children aged 8-12 years living in the Chinese Mainland. Therefore, the primary objective of this study will be to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a culturally adapted 16-session version of the social skills programme KONTAKT in Chinese autistic children. Additionally, preliminary efficacy and cost-effectiveness will be assessed to inform a future definitive trial. This study will employ a randomised, single-blinded, waitlist-controlled feasibility design with 36 Chinese autistic children aged 8-12 years with IQ over 70 referred to the Child Development and Behavior Center in Guangzhou, China. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the immediate training group or the delayed training group stratified by sex. Feasibility will be assessed using quantitative and qualitative data obtained from the KONTAKT CHILD participants, their parents and facilitators of the programme. Preliminary efficacy and cost-effectiveness are assessed via quantitative data obtained at five time points. The primary efficacy outcome is participants' improvement in social skills as measured by the Contextual Assessment of Social Skills. Other outcomes include parents and teachers' reports of participants' autistic traits and adaptive functioning, participants' self-report and projective tests for self-assertiveness and psychosocial functioning, and parent reports on parental reflective functioning and perceived school support.

Applied behaviour analysis (ABA) and music therapy are recognised interventions for improving ASD symptoms. However, the specific benefits of parent-child music therapy and ABA for autistic children and their mothers remain uncertain. This study evaluated the effects of parent-child music therapy on preschool autistic children and their mothers. A randomised controlled trial was conducted with 100 mother-child pairs assigned to either the control group receiving ABA or the intervention group receiving both music therapy and ABA. Qualitative interviews were conducted post-intervention for 12 mothers. Children in the intervention group exhibited lower scores for ASD symptoms than those in the control group. Moreover, mothers in the intervention group demonstrated reduced dysfunctional parent-child interaction, lower overall parental stress, significantly improved family functioning, and increased levels of hope compared with those in the control group. Mothers held positive views regarding music therapy. Combining ABA with parent-child music therapy can alleviate ASD symptoms in children and reduce stress in mothers. Improved parent-child interaction and enhanced family functioning further support the benefits of this combined approach. Parent-child music therapy, combined with ABA demonstrated positive outcomes for autistic children, including reduced ASD symptoms, improved parent-child interaction, decreased parental stress, enhanced family functioning, and increased hope. These findings highlight the potential of incorporating music therapy as a valuable component in the comprehensive treatment of ASD.

Multiple clinical trials support naturalistic developmental behavior interventions (NDBIs) that integrate ABA and developmental science and are considered best practices for young autistic children. The Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) is a comprehensive NDBI shown to improve social communication outcomes for young autistic children in several controlled efficacy studies. However, effectiveness data regarding NDBI use in community-based agencies are limited. This study uses a community-partnered approach to test the effectiveness of ESDM compared to usual early behavioral intervention (EBI) for improving social communication and language in autistic children served by community agencies. This is a hybrid type 1 cluster-randomized controlled trial with 2 conditions: ESDM and EBI. In the intervention group, supervising providers will receive training in ESDM; in the control group, they will continue EBI as usual. We will enroll and randomize 100 supervisors (50 ESDM, 50 EBI) by region. Each supervisor enrolls 3 families of autistic children under age 5 (n = 300) and accompanying behavior technicians (n = 200). The primary outcome is child language and social communication at 6 and 12 months. Secondary outcomes include child adaptive behavior, caregiver use of ESDM strategies, and provider intervention fidelity. Child social motivation and caregiver fidelity will be tested as mediating variables. ESDM implementation determinants will be explored using mixed methods. This study will contribute novel knowledge on ESDM effectiveness, the variables that mediate and moderate child outcomes, and engagement of its mechanisms in community use. We expect results from this trial to increase community availability of this model and access to high-quality intervention for young autistic children, especially those who depend on publicly funded intervention services. Understanding implementation determinants will aid scale-up of effective models within communities. Clinicaltrials.gov identifier number NCT06005285. Registered on August 21, 2023.

A significant group by time difference was observed in child sleep (Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire) with large effect sizes (d = 0.87-1.05), emotion and behaviour (Developmental Behavior Checklist 2) with moderate effect sizes (d = 0.40-0.57), and caregiver mental health (Kessler 10) with small to moderate effect sizes (d = 0.60-0.28), favouring the intervention group (n = 23). There were no significant group differences in child (Child Health Utility instrument) or caregiver (Assessment of Quality of Life) quality of life. However, there were individual differences in the clinical significance of improved child sleep. Qualitative data showed that whilst telehealth was convenient for caregivers, without attenuating the benefits of most key intervention features, not all children were able to engage effectively with the clinician via telehealth. This first pilot RCT of a brief telehealth behavioural sleep intervention for primary-school-aged autistic children suggests that telehealth delivery is acceptable, feasible and likely efficacious in improving sleep in the short-term. Providing families with ongoing choice of mode of delivery (telehealth/in-person) and examining the person-environment fit of telehealth for autistic children is important.","Lewis Samantha, Rinehart Nicole, Mantilla Ana, Alvares Gail, Hiscock Harriet, Marks Deborah, Papadopoulos Nicole",Sleep medicine,"Humans, Female, Male, Telemedicine, Pilot Projects, Child, Caregivers, Child, Preschool, Autistic Disorder, Australia, Sleep Wake Disorders, Surveys and Questionnaires, Behavior Therapy",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39306958,"Royal Children's Hospital, 50 Flemington Road, Parkville, Victoria, 3052, Australia.; Monash Krongold Clinic, Faculty of Education, Monash University, Wellington Road, Clayton, Victoria, 3168, Australia; School of Psychological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Nursing, and Health Sciences, Monash University, 18 Innovation Walk, Clayton, Victoria, 3800, Australia.; School of Educational Psychology and Counselling, Faculty of Education, Monash University, 19 Ancora Imparo Way, Clayton, Victoria, 3800, Australia; School of Psychological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Nursing, and Health Sciences, Monash University, 18 Innovation Walk, Clayton, Victoria, 3800, Australia.; Murdoch Children's Research Institute, 50 Flemington Road, Parkville, Victoria, 3052, Australia; Department of Paediatrics, University of Melbourne, Grattan Street, Parkville, Victoria, 3010, Australia; Royal Children's Hospital, 50 Flemington Road, Parkville, Victoria, 3052, Australia.; The Kids Research Institute Australia, The University of Western Australia, Nedlands, Western Australia, 6007, Australia.; School of Educational Psychology and Counselling, Faculty of Education, Monash University, 19 Ancora Imparo Way, Clayton, Victoria, 3800, Australia; Monash Krongold Clinic, Faculty of Education, Monash University, Wellington Road, Clayton, Victoria, 3168, Australia.; School of Educational Psychology and Counselling, Faculty of Education, Monash University, 19 Ancora Imparo Way, Clayton, Victoria, 3800, Australia; Monash Krongold Clinic, Faculty of Education, Monash University, Wellington Road, Clayton, Victoria, 3168, Australia; School of Psychological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Nursing, and Health Sciences, Monash University, 18 Innovation Walk, Clayton, Victoria, 3800, Australia.

It is characterized by exacerbated neuronal excitability, and its correction is considered an objective measure of treatment response in animal models, a marker albeit rarely used in clinical trials. Here, we used an extensive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) battery to assess the neurophysiological effects of a therapy combining two disease-modifying drugs, lovastatin (40 mg) and minocycline (100 mg), administered alone for 8 weeks and in combination for 12 weeks, in 19 patients (mean age of 23.58 ± 1.51) with FXS taking part in the LOVAmix trial. The TMS battery, which included the resting motor threshold, short-interval intracortical inhibition, long-interval intracortical inhibition, corticospinal silent period, and intracortical facilitation, was completed at baseline after 8 weeks of monotherapy (visit 2 of the clinical trial) and after 12 weeks of dual therapy (visit 4 of the clinical trial). Repeated measure ANOVAs were performed between baseline and visit 2 (monotherapy) and visit 3 (dual therapy) with interactions for which monotherapy the participants received when they began the clinical trial. Results showed that dual therapy was associated with reduced cortical excitability after 20 weeks. This was reflected by a significant increase in the resting-motor threshold after dual therapy compared to baseline. There was a tendency for enhanced short-intracortical inhibition, a marker of GABAa-mediated inhibition after 8 weeks of monotherapy compared to baseline. Together, these results suggest that a combined therapy of minocycline and lovastatin might act on the core neurophysiopathology of FXS.

This study examined the effect of telehealth delivery of a parent-mediated NDBI, Project ImPACT, on children's expressive language ability using a randomized control trial with intent-to-treat analysis. Sixty-four young autistic children and their primary caregiver were matched on age and developmental quotient and randomly assigned to receive 6 months of therapist-assisted Project ImPACT (i.e., telehealth coaching), self-directed Project ImPACT, or an active control. Parent-child interactions were recorded at intake and immediately post-treatment, and the children's expressive language skills were assessed at intake and a 9-month follow-up using standardized measures. Although there was no total effect of treatment group assignment on child outcomes, a serial mediation analysis revealed that therapist-assisted ImPACT had an indirect effect on children's expressive language ability at follow-up through their parents' use of the intervention strategies and their intentional communication immediately post-treatment.

They struggle to balance caring for their child and other tasks. This can affect their emotional well-being and cause guilt and other psychological problems. WHAT DOES THE PAPER ADD TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing with finger movements can reduce guilt in parents of autistic children. Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing with Elite mobile health software movements can reduce guilt in parents of autistic children. The bilateral eye stimulation method using finger movements has a more sustained impact than the Elite app's bilateral stimulation method. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Healthcare providers are encouraged to learn Eye Movements Desensitization and Reprocessing. Healthcare providers are encouraged to use these methods to help with psychological issues in children with autism. Psychiatric nurses are encouraged to utilize this treatment approach for parents of children with autism, as well as to help alleviate feelings of guilt more broadly. INTRODUCTION: Caring for an autistic child at home can be challenging for parents, as it can make it difficult to balance their responsibilities. This imbalance can negatively affect the emotional well-being of the caregiver and lead to feelings of guilt. While this is a known issue, there may be gaps in knowledge specific to Iran. In this study, a new method was introduced to address this issue. This study aimed to examine the impact of desensitization with eye movements and reprocessing (EMDR) on reducing parental guilt among autistic children's families. We aim to examine the effectiveness of two different treatment methods. This study involved 90 parents (60 mothers, 30 fathers) of autistic children randomly assigned to either an experimental or control group. The two experimental groups received a 45-min intervention session once a week for 3 weeks, while the control group did not receive any intervention. Data on feelings of guilt was collected using a questionnaire. After 30 days, both groups took a follow-up test. The data were analysed using statistical software. This study found that there were significant differences in guilt feelings among different groups of EMDR therapy and a control group. Specifically, no significant differences were observed in the mean guilt scores between the experimental and control groups at the pre-intervention stage (p > .05). However, the experimental groups exhibited significantly lower mean guilt scores immediately after the intervention and 1 month later than the control group (p < .05). Immediately after the intervention and 1 month later, no significant differences were observed between the two experimental groups (p > .05). The findings of this study demonstrate the efficacy of desensitization treatment using eye movements and reprocessing in reducing feelings of guilt among autistic children's parents. In the follow-up phase, it seems that the two-way stimulation method with finger movements is more effective than Elite software in terms of the continuity of the effect. Healthcare providers are encouraged to learn and use these methods to help prevent and treat psychological issues in autistic children.","Rashidi Hadi, Sadeghian Efat, Shamsaei Farshid, Tapak Leili, Seyedi Mahdieh",Journal of psychiatric and mental health nursing,"Humans, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing, Parents, Male, Female, Adult, Guilt, Child, Autistic Disorder, Mobile Applications, Child, Preschool, Middle Aged",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39056559,"Chronic Diseases (Home Care) Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran.; Modeling of No Communicable Diseases Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran.; Student Research Center, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran.; Research Center for Behavioral Disorders and Substance Abuse, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran.; Instructor of Department of Occupational Therapy, School of Rehabilitation Sciences, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."

Despite RO DBT's growing popularity among clinicians as a treatment for chronic depression, personality disorders and eating disorders, to date, no systematic review has been conducted to summarise the evidence on this therapy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to systematically review the literature to provide a current and comprehensive summary of the available evidence on the clinical applications and efficacy of RO DBT. Articles were included if they were original research studies that described the use of RO DBT in the treatment of any psychological disorder, condition or symptom, published in the English language in a peer-reviewed journal. Four electronic databases were searched, and screening, selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction were all conducted by two independent reviewers. Fourteen articles were included in this review, including two qualitative articles, one case study, five case series studies, four quasi-experimental studies, and two articles describing one randomized control trial. Findings indicated there is emerging evidence for the use of RO DBT in both adolescents and adults, for disorders characterized by excessive self-control, such as anorexia nervosa and autism, as well as for treatment-resistant depression. While RO DBT shows promise as a treatment for disorders of overcontrol, further research is needed.

The aim of this pilot study (prospective randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled) was to evaluate efficacy of the biological response modifier Juvenil in modulating the microbiome of children with ASD and, in particular, whether Juvenil is able to alleviate the symptoms of ASD. In total, 20 children with ASD and 12 neurotypical children were included in our study. Supplementation of ASD children lasted for three months. To confirm Juvenil's impact on the gut microbiome, stool samples were collected from all children and the microbiome's composition was analyzed. This pilot study demonstrated that the gut microbiome of ASD children differed significantly from that of healthy controls and was converted by Juvenil supplementation toward a more neurotypical microbiome that positively modulated children's autism symptoms.","Hrnciarova Jela, Kubelkova Klara, Bostik Vanda, Rychlik Ivan, Karasova Daniela, Babak Vladimir, Datkova Magdalena, Simackova Katerina, Macela Ales",Nutrients,"Humans, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Pilot Projects, Double-Blind Method, Male, Female, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Dietary Supplements, Feces, Child, Preschool, Prospective Studies, Autistic Disorder, Dysbiosis",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38999736,"Veterinary Research Institute, 621 00 Brno, Czech Republic.; Military Faculty of Medicine, University of Defence, 500 03 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.; Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, 500 03 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic."

While cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) applications appear promising, trials to date have largely excluded social communication skill development and have not been designed to include a wider range of emotional challenges. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to pilot a uniquely modified CBT program targeting emotion regulation, including social communication training, and explicitly focusing on the child's areas of circumscribed interest in order to teach skills and promote generalization. Forty participants were randomly assigned to either the CBT group or a waitlist control (WLC) group, resulting in 20 school-aged children in each group. The treatment approach was determined to be feasible and acceptable, and therapy engagement and attendance were reasonably high. Caregivers expressed high satisfaction with the program, qualitatively citing gains in skills such as social problem-solving, emotion identification, and identifying and processing cognitive distortions. The primary outcome of postintervention changes was not significantly different between the groups (CBT vs. WLC). The mean Social Skills Improvement System score decreased by 0.44 points (95% confidence interval [CI]: -5.04, 4.15) in the CBT group and increased by 0.41 points (95% CI: -4.23, 5.04) in the WLC group, and the postintervention changes were not significantly different between the groups (difference: -0.85; 95% CI: -7.29, 5.60; <i>p</i> = .79).

In a cocreation process with experts and parents, a low-threshold application that uses exercises based on the principles of positive psychology and mindfulness was developed. This application, called ""Adappt,"" aims at enhancing the ability to adapt of the parents and caregivers of children with NDDs and at supporting their mental health. This protocol describes the evaluation study of the effectiveness of Adappt, its core working mechanisms and user experiences. A pragmatic international multicenter randomized controlled trial will compare the effectiveness of Adappt with a (delayed) waitlist control condition. At least 212 parents or primary caregivers of children younger than 18 years diagnosed with or suspected of a NDD will be randomly assigned to the intervention or waitlist control condition. Participants are excluded if they have severe anxiety or depression levels or are in treatment for mental health issues. Measures will be collected online at baseline, post-intervention (1 month after baseline), and 4 and 7 months after baseline. The primary outcome is the improvement in generic sense of ability to adapt as measured with the Generic Sense of Ability to Adapt Scale (GSAAS; (Front Psychol 14:985408, 2023)) at 4-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes are mental well-being, (parental) distress, and client satisfaction with ""Adappt.""

Supports for autistic children involve the use of adapted interventions that target emotion regulation and social skills, alongside mental health symptoms. The Secret Agent Society Small Group (SAS: SG), an adapted cognitive behavioural program, has demonstrated efficacy through lab-delivered randomized control trials. However, research is still needed on its effectiveness when delivered by publicly funded, community-based autism providers under real-world ecologically valid conditions, especially within the context of a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted access to community-based supports and services for autistic children, and programs have adapted their services to online platforms. However, questions remain about the feasibility and clinical utility of evidence-based interventions and services delivered virtually in community-based settings. The 9-week SAS: SG program was delivered virtually by seven community-based autism service providers during 2020-2021. The program included the use of computer-based games, role-playing tasks, and home missions. Caregivers completed surveys at three timepoints: pre-, post-intervention, and after a 3-month follow-up session. Surveys assessed caregivers' perception of the program's acceptability and level of satisfaction, as well as their child's social and emotional regulation skills and related mental health challenges. A total of 77 caregivers (94% gender identity females; Mean = 42.1 years, SD = 6.5 years) and their children (79% gender identity males; Mean = 9.9 years, SD = 1.3 years) completed the SAS: SG program. Caregivers agreed that the program was acceptable (95%) and were highly satisfied (90%). Caregivers reported significant reduction in their child's emotion reactivity from pre- to post-intervention (-1.78 (95% CI, -3.20 to -0.29), p = 0.01, d = 0.36), that continued to decrease after the 3-month booster session (-1.75 (95% CI, -3.34 to -0.16), p = 0.02, d = 0.33). Similarly, improvements in anxiety symptoms were observed (3.05 (95% CI, 0.72 to 5.36), p = 0.006, d = 0.39). As online delivery of interventions for autistic children remains popular past the pandemic, our findings shed light on future considerations for community-based services, including therapists and agency leaders, on how best to tailor and optimally deliver virtually based programming.

We studied the use of accelerated theta burst stimulation (ATBS) for the treatment of refractory MDD in ASD (3 treatments daily x 10 days). This prospective open-label 12-week trial included 10 subjects with a mean age of 21.5 years, randomized to receive unilateral or bilateral stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. One participant dropped out of the study due to intolerability. In both treatment arms, depressive symptoms, scored on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores, diminished substantially. At 12 weeks post-treatment, full remission was sustained in 5 subjects and partial remission in 3 subjects. Treatment with ATBS, regardless of the site of stimulation, was associated with a significant, substantial, and sustained improvement in depressive symptomatology via the primary outcome measure, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Additional secondary measures, including self-report depression scales, fluid cognition, and sleep quality, also showed significant improvement. No serious adverse events occurred during the study. Mild transient headaches were infrequently reported, which are expected side effects of ATBS. Overall, ATBS treatment was highly effective and well-tolerated in individuals with ASD and co-occurring MDD. The findings support the need for a larger, sham-controlled randomized controlled trial to further evaluate efficacy of ATBS in this population.","Blank Elizabeth, Gilbert Donald L, Wu Steve W, Larsh Travis, Elmaghraby Rana, Liu Rui, Smith Elizabeth, Westerkamp Grace, Liu Yanchen, Horn Paul S, Greenstein Ethan, Sweeney John A, Erickson Craig A, Pedapati Ernest V",Journal of autism and developmental disorders,"Humans, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Male, Female, Depressive Disorder, Major, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult, Adult, Adolescent, Prospective Studies, Theta Rhythm, Depressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, Prefrontal Cortex",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38744742,"Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, United States. ernest.pedapati@cchmc.org.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, United States.; Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, United States.; Division of Behavioral Medicine and Child Psychology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, United States.; Division of Neurology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, United States."

However, to date, there is limited research on how caregivers' skills change, and, in turn, impact child outcomes. We evaluated the NDBI strategy use of 191 caregivers prior to participation in NDBIs (or control groups) across multiple randomized controlled trials, using the Measure of NDBI Strategy Implementation, Caregiver Change (MONSI-CC). Clustering analyses were used to examine caregiver variability in NDBI strategy use at intervention entry. Generalized Linear Mixed Models were used to examine changes in caregiver strategy use over the course of intervention and its impact on changes in children's social communication. Using clustering analysis, we found that caregivers' baseline skills fit four profiles: limited, emerging, variable, and consistent/high, with few demographic factors distinguishing these groups. Caregivers starting with limited or emerging skills improved in their strategy use with intervention. Caregivers starting with more skills (consistent/high or variable) maintained higher skills over intervention. Children of caregivers in these groups who received target NDBIs improved in their social communication skills. Results suggested that caregiver skills improve through participation in NDBIs and may directly contribute to their children's outcomes, although more research on mediating factors is needed. Individualized approaches for caregivers and their children starting with differing skill profiles at intervention entry may be warranted.","Brown Hallie, Swain Deanna, Kim Hye Won, Rogers Sally, Estes Annette, Kasari Connie, Lord Catherine, Kim So Hyun","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","Humans, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Caregivers, Male, Female, Child, Preschool, Behavior Therapy, Adult, Child",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38719439,"School of Psychology, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea.; University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Semel Institute of Neuroscience and Human Behavior, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.; MIND Institute, University of California, Davis, Sacramento, CA, USA."

However, studies investigating maternal selenium in relation to child neurodevelopmental disorders are scarce. 719 mother-child pairs from the prospective population-based Odense Child Cohort study in Denmark were included. Three selenium biomarkers, i.e. concentrations of serum selenium, selenoprotein P (SELENOP), and activity of glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3), along with serum copper, zinc and iron were measured in early third trimester (at 28.9+/-0.8 weeks of pregnancy). ADHD and ASD traits in children were assessed systematically using the established Child Behaviour Checklist at 5 years of age, based on a Danish reference cohort with cut-off at 90th percentile. Multivariable regression models adjusted for biologically relevant confounders were applied. 155 of 719 (21.6 %) children had ASD traits and 59 of 719 (8.2 %) children had traits of ADHD at 5 years of age. In crude and adjusted models, all three selenium biomarkers associated inversely with ADHD traits. For ADHD, fully adjusted OR for 10 μg/L increment in selenium was 0.76 (95 % CI 0.60, 0.94), for one mg/L increment in SELENOP was 0.73 (0.56, 0.95), and for 10 U/L increment in GPx3 was 0.93 (0.87,1.00). Maternal total selenium was inversely associated with child ASD traits, OR per 10 μg/L increment was 0.85 (0.74, 0,98). SELENOP and GPx3 were not associated with ASD traits. The associations were specific to selenium, as other trace elements such as copper, zinc, or iron were not associated with the outcomes. The results provide coherent evidence for selenium deficiency as a risk factor for ADHD and ASD traits in an environment with borderline supply, the causality of which should be elucidated in a randomized controlled trial.","Demircan Kamil, Chillon Thilo Samson, Jensen Richard Christian, Jensen Tina Kold, Sun Qian, Bonnema Steen Joop, Glintborg Dorte, Bilenberg Niels, Andersen Marianne Skovsager, Schomburg Lutz",Free radical biology & medicine,"Humans, Selenium, Female, Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity, Pregnancy, Glutathione Peroxidase, Male, Denmark, Child, Preschool, Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects, Selenoprotein P, Adult, Biomarkers, Prospective Studies, Autistic Disorder, Cohort Studies, Child, Zinc, Copper",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38704054,"Institute for Experimental Endocrinology, Max Rubner Center (MRC) for Cardiovascular Metabolic Renal Research, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.; Department of Clinical Research, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark; Department of Child and Adolescent Mental Health, Mental Health Services in the Region of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.; Institute for Experimental Endocrinology, Max Rubner Center (MRC) for Cardiovascular Metabolic Renal Research, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.

Naturalistic Developmental Behavior Interventions (NDBIs) are among the most effective, evidence-based, and widely used behavior interventions for autism. However, no research has been conducted on which of the several NDBI methods is most effective for parents and children with autism spectrum disorders. Therefore, we conducted a network meta-analysis to compare the specific effects of each type of parental-mediated NDBI on children's developmental skills and parent fidelity. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Medline, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), CINAHL, and Wanfang databases were searched from inception to August 30, 2023. A total of 32 randomized controlled trial studies that examined the efficacy of different NDBIs were included. Parents of children with ASD who received Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT) reported significant improvements in their children's social skills (SUCRA, 74.1%), language skills (SUCRA, 88.3%), and parenting fidelity (SUCRA, 99.5%). Moreover, parents who received Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) reported significant improvements in their children's language (SMD = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.79) and motor skills (SMD = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.79). In terms of the efficacy of improving parent fidelity, the results showed that the Improving Parents as Communication Teachers (ImPACT) intervention significantly improved parent fidelity when compared with the treatment-as-usual group (TAU) (SMD = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.39, 1.42) and the parental education intervention (PEI) (SMD = 1.10, 95% CI:0.28, 1.91).There was a difference in parent fidelity among parents who received PRT(SMD = 3.53, 95% CI: 2.26, 4.79) or ESDM(SMD = 1.42, 95% CI: 0.76, 2.09) training compared with PEI. In conclusion, this study revealed that parents can achieve high fidelity with the ImPACT intervention, and it can serve as an early first step for children newly diagnosed with ASD. It also showed that parent-mediated ESDM is effective in improving language and motor skills for children with ASD and can be used as part of the second stage of parent training. Parent-mediated PRT can also be used as a third stage of parent training with sufficient training intensity to further improve language, social, and motor skills.","Ouyang Yuling, Feng Junyan, Wang Tiantian, Xue Yang, Mohamed Zakaria Ahmed, Jia Feiyong",BMC pediatrics,"Humans, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Parents, Network Meta-Analysis, Child, Behavior Therapy, Social Skills, Child Development, Parenting, Child, Preschool, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38664754,"Department of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, the First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, 130021, China.; Department of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, the First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, 130021, China. jiafy@jlu.edu.cn."

It was hypothesized that Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback (HRVB) increases cardiac vagal modulation in adolescents with autism, resulting in positive effects on physiological and psychosocial parameters. It was also hypothesized that home-based HRVB training is feasible. In a single-blind, randomized sham-controlled pilot trial, adolescents with autism performed supervised HRVB (n = 24) or sham training (n = 20). Subsequently, half of the adolescents received HRVB training at home, whereas the other subset did not practice. Physiological, cortisol and behavioral data were collected during stress-provoking assessments before and after each training period. Supervised HRVB resulted in a late increase in cardiac vagal modulation in adolescents with autism. Heart rate increased and cortisol decreased significantly immediately after supervised HRVB, but none of these effects remained after follow-up. Following supervised HRVB, no significant change in psychosocial functioning was found. Home-based HRVB was feasible, adolescents reported lower symptoms of stress, but a significant decrease in compliance rate was found. HRVB is feasible and effective in adolescents with autism given the late-emerging increases in cardiac vagal modulation and decrease in stress symptoms. Replicating this study with a larger sample and further exploration of the working mechanisms of HRVB are recommended.

The goal of the present study was to conduct a randomized controlled trial of a 12-week social intervention (SUCCESS), which combined an inclusive social group with a parent education program. Twenty-five 4- to 6-year-olds with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) were randomized to SUCCESS (N = 11) or to treatment as usual (N = 14). Combining a peer group model with a parent training program, the SUCCESS intervention used naturalistic behavioral techniques (e.g., environmental arrangement, natural reinforcement) to increase social initiations to peers. After 12 weeks, children participating in the SUCCESS program made more frequent initiations to peers than children in the treatment-as-usual group, including more prompted and unprompted initiations to request. Additional gains in clinician-rated social functioning were observed in children randomized to SUCCESS, while differential treatment effects were not detected in parent-rated measures. However, lower baseline social motivation was associated with greater parent-reported initiation improvement. This study provides preliminary support for the efficacy of a naturalistic, behavioral social skills intervention to improve peer initiations for children with ASD. The findings suggest that using a motivation-based social skills group was effective in increasing both prompted and spontaneous initiations to peers, and highlights the need for further research into the role of baseline social motivation in predicting social skills treatment response.","Shkel Jane, Geng Alicia, Pilchak Elise, Millan Maria Estefania, Schwartzman Jessica M, Schuck Rachel, Bundang Maria Victoria, Barnowski Agatha, Slap Devon M, Stratford Sydney, Hardan Antonio Y, Phillips Jennifer M, Gengoux Grace W",Journal of autism and developmental disorders,"Humans, Male, Female, Child, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Social Skills, Motivation, Child, Preschool, Pilot Projects, Parents, Peer Group, Psychotherapy, Group, Behavior Therapy, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38446265,"Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, USA. ggengoux@stanford.edu.; Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, USA.; Palo Alto University, Palo Alto, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA.; Stanford Medicine Children's Health, Stanford, USA."

We conducted an electronic database search of Academic Search Premier, CINHAL, ERIC, Medline, and APA PsycINFO in October 2022 and August 2023 and utilized snowball methods to locate relevant reviews of NDBI. We included reviews meeting the following inclusion criteria: (1) review included a meta-analytic synthesis for at least one child outcome; (2) primary studies examined a NDBI; (3) primary studies included children with ASD with a mean pre-treatment age under eight years; (4) primary studies were conducted using a two-group comparison design; and (5) review was published in English. We extracted data on characteristics of the review, participant characteristics from the primary studies, intervention characteristics, and assessed the risk of bias of the included reviews. We conducted a narrative synthesis across outcomes reported in the included reviews. We included five reviews from six reports in this overview. Two reviews included studies that examined the Early Start Denver Model, two reviews included studies that examined the Pivotal Response Treatment, and one review included studies examining NDBIs collectively. We found positive effects of NDBIs on child's communication/language, cognition, and adaptive behavior. We found mixed effects for NDBIs on autism symptomatology and restricted and repetitive behaviors. Examination of moderator analyses reported in the included reviews suggested variables influencing the effects of NDBIs included proximity of outcome to intervention, boundedness of outcome to intervention, and study location. As shown in this overview, positive effects of NDBI for young children with ASD are supported by meta-analytic evidence. While the overall findings for NDBI across reviews are positive, the findings on specific outcomes and influential variables moderating the effects of NDBI are inconsistent.

Regarding salivary oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) epigenetics (DNA-methylation), oxytocin-induced reductions in OXTR DNA-methylation were observed, suggesting a facilitation of oxytocin receptor expression in the oxytocin compared to the placebo group. Notably, heightened oxytocin levels post-treatment were significantly associated with reduced OXTR DNA-methylation and improved feelings of secure attachment.

Included studies were randomized clinical trials (RCTs), controlled studies, and single-group before-and-after studies that reported health-related outcomes. This review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) reporting guidelines. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to synthesize the data. The findings of studies that were ineligible for meta-analysis were summarized according to the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWIM) reporting guidelines.

Although pathways to depression are complex, emotional reactivity and negative self-esteem are two risk factors for depression in autistic and non-autistic youth. Although autistic youth are more likely to experience depression than their non-autistic peers, psychotherapy options for autistic youth are very limited; community guidance in the development and testing of psychotherapy programs is a promising approach in autism. Therefore, in this study, we designed an autism-adapted CBT-DAY, in collaboration with autistic community members. Specifically, CBT-DAY combined neurodiversity-affirming and cognitive behavioral approaches to target emotional reactivity and self-esteem in youth to improve depressive symptom severity in a group setting across 12 weeks. We examined the preliminary feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of CBT-DAY in a pilot non-randomized trial. In addition, we implemented a rigorous protocol for assessing, monitoring, and addressing potential harms in this intervention. Results from 24 autistic youth (11-17 years old) suggest that CBT-DAY may be feasible to use in an outpatient clinical setting and generally acceptable to youth and their caregivers. Participation in CBT-DAY may be associated with significant improvements in youth emotional reactivity and self-esteem, as well as depressive symptom severity per self-report only. Exploratory analyses showed that participation in CBT-DAY may also be associated with significant improvements in internalizing symptoms.

Adverse events were poorly monitored, but possibly common. The available evidence on interventions to support young autistic children has approximately doubled in four years. Some evidence from randomized controlled trials shows that behavioral interventions improve caregiver perception of challenging behavior and child social emotional functioning, and that technology based interventions support proximal improvements in specific social communication and social emotional skills. Evidence also shows that developmental interventions improve social communication in interactions with caregivers, and naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions improve core challenges associated with autism, particularly difficulties with social communication.

Music therapy holds promise as an intervention for individuals with autism, harnessing their strengths in music processing to enhance communication and expression. While previous randomized controlled trials have demonstrated positive outcomes in terms of global improvement and quality of life, their reliance on psychological outcomes restricts our understanding of underlying mechanisms. This paper introduces the protocol for the Music for Autism study, a randomized crossover trial designed to investigate the effects of a 12-week music therapy intervention on a range of psychometric, neuroimaging, and biological outcomes in school-aged children with autism. The protocol builds upon previous research and aims to both replicate and expand upon findings that demonstrated improvements in social communication and functional brain connectivity following a music intervention. The primary objective of this trial is to determine whether music therapy leads to improvements in social communication and functional brain connectivity as compared to play-based therapy. In addition, secondary aims include exploring various relevant psychometric, neuroimaging, and biological outcomes. To achieve these objectives, we will enroll 80 participants aged 6-12 years in this international, assessor-blinded, crossover randomized controlled trial. Each participant will be randomly assigned to receive either music therapy or play-based therapy for a period of 12 weeks, followed by a 12-week washout period, after which they will receive the alternate intervention.

37873560,10.1002/Aur.3041,The use of noninvasive brain stimulation techniques in autism spectrum disorder.,2024-01-01,"Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), have recently emerged as alternative, nonpharmacological interventions for a variety of psychiatric, neurological, and neurodevelopmental conditions. NIBS is beginning to be applied in both research and clinical settings for the treatment of core and associated symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) including social communication deficits, restricted and repetitive behaviors, irritability, hyperactivity, depression and impairments in executive functioning and sensorimotor integration. Though there is much promise for these targeted device-based interventions, in other disorders (including adult major depressive disorder (MDD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) where rTMS is FDA cleared), data on the safety and efficacy of these interventions in individuals with ASD is limited especially in younger children when neurodevelopmental interventions typically begin. Most studies are open-label, small scale, and/or focused on a restricted subgroup of individuals with ASD. There is a need for larger, randomized controlled trials that incorporate neuroimaging in order to develop predictive biomarkers of treatment response and optimize treatment parameters. We contend that until such studies are conducted, we do not have adequate estimates of the safety and efficacy of NIBS interventions in children across the spectrum. Thus, broad off-label use of these techniques in this population is not supported by currently available evidence. Here we discuss the existing data on the use of NIBS to treat symptoms related to ASD and discuss future directions for the field.","Oberman Lindsay M, Francis Sunday M, Lisanby Sarah H",Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research,"Child, Adult, Humans, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation, Depressive Disorder, Major, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Brain",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37873560,"Noninvasive Neuromodulation Unit, Experimental Therapeutics and Pathophysiology Branch, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."

The study utilized the PubMed and Embase databases to locate randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental treatment studies, and randomized clinical trial comparisons. The experimental group received treatment based on an applied behavioral approach, such as PECS, DTT, PRT, TEACCH, ESDM, and EIBI. After examining seventeen studies, the researchers found that each type of behavioral intervention had a positive impact. Naturalistic protocols that employed PRT and PECS improved ASD symptoms in general, despite their targeting of particular cognitive domains such as language. ESDM enhanced receptive language, particularly in preschool-aged children. Structured and integrated interventions, like EIBI and TEACCH, improved overall adaptive functioning. Combining DTT with a TEACCH program produced greater benefits in linguistic, affective-social, and personal autonomy domains. However, there is a scarcity of high-quality research available on behavioral interventions for ASD. Further comparative studies are necessary to identify cost-efficient interventions. For example, PRT and PECS significantly improved social communication skills in only 15-40 hours over six months. The authors emphasized the need for continued research and the application of evidence-based interventions in specialized settings.","Pruneti Carlo, Coscioni Gabriella, Guidotti Sara",Clinical child psychology and psychiatry,"Child, Child, Preschool, Humans, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Communication, Behavior Therapy, Social Skills",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37803891,"Journey Autism & Behavioral Care Center, Charlestown, MA, USA.; Clinical Psychology, Clinical Psychophysiology and Clinical Neuropsychology Labs, Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy."

37703248,10.1371/Journal.Pone.0291168,The mechanism and effectiveness of mindfulness-based intervention for reducing the psychological distress of parents of children with autism spectrum disorder: A protocol of randomized control trial of ecological momentary intervention and assessment.,2023-01-01,"Existing studies have unequivocally demonstrated that parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience various stressful daily life events and suffer from psychological distress. Mindfulness level is found to be an effective buffer between parents' appraisal of stress life events and psychological distress. However, the mechanism behind the function of mindfulness is unclear, and traditional mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) in experimental settings is not tailored to personal real-life needs. This study proposes to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the effectiveness of MBI delivered by ecological momentary intervention (EMI) and assessed by ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in changing participants' cognitive appraisal of stressful life events and thus reducing the psychological distress of parents of children with ASD. The proposed study will recruit 670 parents of children with ASD and randomly assign them to the intervention and control groups (335 in each group). Participants in the intervention group will install the EMI/A app on their smartphones. In the app, participants can receive practice prompts daily, browse and practice different mindfulness exercises in the intervention library at any time, talk to a virtual counselor (chatbot) when feeling stressed, complete EMA on the cognitive appraisal of life events, and receive the log of change of psychological status daily. Participants in the control group will only receive audio-based standardized mindfulness practice instructions three times per week. The effects of MBI will be assessed based on the EMA data, right after the intervention and at the 2-month follow-up. The primary outcome will be participants' psychological distress measured by the depression anxiety stress scale. The secondary outcomes will include participants' subjective well-being, measured by the satisfaction with life scale, and level of resilience, measured by the psychological empowerment scale. Multilevel structural equational modelling will be applied to examine the pathways of the relationship between daily life events, cognitive appraisal, and psychological distress. The potential benefit of the proposed study is to increase the psychological well-being of parents of children with ASD, and the method may extend to participants suffering from other psychological issues in the future.

We examined whether a combination of the Awareness and Care for My Autistic Traits (ACAT) program and treatment-as-usual is more effective than only treatment-as-usual in increasing the understanding of autistic attributes, reducing treatment stigma, and improving mental health and social adaptation among autistic adolescents and their parents/guardians. Forty-nine adolescents and their parents/guardians were randomly assigned to either a combination of ACAT and treatment-as-usual or only treatment-as-usual. The combined group received six weekly 100-minute ACAT sessions, while the treatment-as-usual group received no additional intervention. The primary outcome was the change in understanding of autistic attributes (Autism Knowledge Quiz-Child), administered from pre- to post-intervention. The secondary outcomes included the change in Autism Knowledge Quiz-Parent, reduced treatment stigma, and improved mental health and social adaptation among autistic adolescents and their parents/guardians. A primary outcome measure scale was scored by assessors who were blind to the group assignment. The combined group (both autistic adolescents and their parents/guardians) showed an increase in Autism Knowledge Quiz scores compared to those in the treatment-as-usual group. Autistic adolescents in the combined group also demonstrated a decrease in treatment-related stigma and an improvement in general mental health compared to those in the treatment-as-usual group, while there were no group differences in the change in social adaptation. For parents/guardians, there were no group differences in the change in treatment-related stigma, general mental health, adaptive skills, or attitudes toward their children. The ACAT program could be an effective treatment modality to increase the understanding of autistic attributes among both autistic adolescents and their parents/guardians. The ACAT program positively affects self-understanding, reduces treatment stigma, and stabilizes behavioral issues for autistic adolescents as a part of mental health measures, but it does not effectively reduce treatment barriers or improve mental health for parents/guardians.

37616029,10.2196/45836,Effects of a Nonwearable Digital Therapeutic Intervention on Preschoolers With Autism Spectrum Disorder in China: Open-Label Randomized Controlled Trial.,2023-08-24,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that can cause difficulty with communication and social interactions as well as complicated family dynamics. Digital health interventions can reduce treatment costs and promote healthy lifestyle changes. These therapies can be adjunctive or replace traditional treatments. However, issues with cooperation and compliance prevent preschool patients with ASD from applying these tools. In this open-label, randomized controlled trial, we developed a nonwearable digital therapy called virtual reality-incorporated cognitive behavioral therapy (VR-CBT). The aim of this study was to assess the adjunctive function of VR-CBT by comparing the effects of VR-CBT plus learning style profile (LSP) intervention with those of LSP-only intervention in preschool children with ASD. This trial was performed in China on 78 preschool children (age 3-6 years, IQ>70) diagnosed with ASD who were randomized to receive a 20-week VR-CBT plus LSP intervention (intervention group, 39/78, 50%) or LSP intervention only (control group, 39/78, 50%). The primary outcome was the change of scores from baseline to week 20, assessed by using the parent-rated Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC). Secondary outcomes included the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS-IV), and behavioral performance data (accuracy and reaction time) in go/no-go tasks. All primary and secondary outcomes were analyzed in the intention-to-treat population. After the intervention, there was an intervention effect on total ABC (β=-5.528; P<.001) and CARS scores (β=-1.365; P=.02). A similar trend was observed in the ABC subscales: sensory (β=-1.133; P=.047), relating (β=-1.512; P=.03), body and object use (β=-1.211; P=.03), and social and self-help (β=-1.593; P=.03). The intervention also showed statistically significant effects in improving behavioral performance (go/no-go task, accuracy, β=2.923; P=.04). Moreover, a significant improvement of ADHD hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms was observed in 53 children with comorbid ADHD based on ADHD-RS-IV (β=-1.269; P=.02). No statistically significant intervention effect was detected in the language subscale of ABC (β=-.080; P=.83). Intervention group girls had larger improvements in ABC subscales, that is, sensory and body and object use and in the CARS score and accuracy of go/no-go task (all P<.05) than the control group girls. Statistically significant intervention effects could be observed in hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms in the intervention group boys with comorbid ADHD compared with those in the control group boys (β=-1.333; P=.03). We found potentially positive effects of nonwearable digital therapy plus LSP on core symptoms associated with ASD, leading to a modest improvement in the function of sensory, motor, and response inhibition, while reducing impulsivity and hyperactivity in preschoolers with both ASD and ADHD.

Whilst some people embrace autism as part of their identity, others struggle with their difficulties, and some seek treatment. There are no current interventions that result in complete reduction of autism features. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter for the cholinergic system and has a role in attention, novelty seeking, and memory. Low levels of acetylcholine have been investigated as a potential contributor to autism symptomatology. Donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine (commonly referred to as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) all inhibit acetylcholinesterase, and have slightly different modes of action and biological availability, so their effectiveness and side-effect profiles may vary. The effect of various acetylcholinesterase inhibitor on core autism features across the lifespan, and possible adverse effects, have not been thoroughly investigated. To evaluate the efficacy and harms of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for people with the core features (social interaction, communication, and restrictive and repetitive behaviours) of autism. To assess the effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors on non-core features of autism. In November 2022, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, eight other databases, and two trials registers. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews, and contacted authors of relevant studies. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), comparing acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g. galantamine, donepezil, or rivastigmine) of varying doses, delivered orally or via transdermal patch, either as monotherapy or adjunct therapy, with placebo. People of any age, with a clinical diagnosis of autism were eligible for inclusion. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were core features of autism and adverse effects. Secondary outcomes were language, irritability, hyperactivity, and general health and function. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. We included two RCTs (74 participants). One study was conducted in Iran, the second in the USA, although exact location in the USA is unclear. Galantamine plus risperidone versus placebo plus risperidone One study compared the effects of galantamine plus risperidone to placebo plus risperidone (40 participants, aged 4 years to 12 years). Primary and secondary outcomes of interest were measured postintervention, using subscales of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (score 0 to 3; higher scores = greater impairment). Very low-certainty evidence showed there was little to no difference between the two groups postintervention for social communication (mean difference (MD) -2.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.88 to 0.38), and restricted and repetitive behaviour (MD -0.55, 95% CI -3.47 to 2.37). Overall autism features were not assessed. Adverse events may be higher in the galantamine plus risperidone group (75%) compared with the placebo plus risperidone group (35%): odds ratio 5.57, 95% CI 1.42 to 21.86, low-certainty evidence. No serious adverse events were reported. Low-certainty evidence showed a small difference in irritability (MD -3.50, 95% CI -6.39 to -0.61), with the galantamine plus risperidone group showing a greater decline on the irritability subscale than the placebo group postintervention. There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in hyperactivity postintervention (MD -5.20, 95% CI -10.51 to 0.11). General health and function were not assessed. Donepezil versus placebo One study compared donepezil to placebo (34 participants aged 8 years to 17 years). Primary outcomes of interest were measured postintervention, using subscales of the Modified Version of The Real Life Rating Scale (scored 0 to 3; higher scores = greater impairment). Very low-certainty evidence showed no evidence of group differences immediately postintervention in overall autism features (MD 0.07, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.33), or in the autism symptom domains of social communication (MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.30), and restricted and repetitive behaviours (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.35). Significant adverse events leading to study withdrawal in at least one participant was implied in the data analysis section, but not explicitly reported. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of donepezil, compared to placebo, on the secondary outcomes of interest, including irritability (MD 1.08, 95% CI -0.41 to 2.57), hyperactivity (MD 2.60, 95% CI 0.50 to 4.70), and general health and function (MD 0.03, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.54) postintervention. Across all analyses within this comparison, we judged the evidence to be very low-certainty due to high risk of bias, and very serious imprecision (results based on one small study with wide confidence intervals). The study narratively reported adverse events for the study as a whole, rather than by treatment group. Evidence about the effectiveness of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors as a medication to improve outcomes for autistic adults is lacking, and for autistic children is very uncertain. There is a need for more evidence of improvement in outcomes of relevance to clinical care, autistic people, and their families. There are a number of ongoing studies involving acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and future updates of this review may add to the current evidence.","Ure Alexandra, Cox Georgina R, Haslam Richard, Williams Katrina",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Child, Humans, Acetylcholine, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Cholinesterase Inhibitors, Donepezil, Galantamine, Risperidone, Rivastigmine, Child, Preschool, Adolescent",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37267443,"Department of Paediatrics, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.; Mental Health Department, The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia."

Time effects of 8-week cTBS on symptoms and executive function were remarkable in both Active and Sham groups, with comparable response rates and effect sizes of changes in symptoms/cognition between groups. Our results from a sufficiently powered sample do not endorse the superior efficacy of cTBS over the left DLPFC to the shamed stimulation for children, adolescents and adults with ASD.

37091539,10.1177/26334895231154289,Concordance of multiple informant assessment of school-based social skills intervention and association with child outcomes: Results from a randomized trial.,2023-01-01,"Fidelity, or the degree to which an intervention is implemented as designed, is essential for effective implementation. There has been a growing emphasis on assessing fidelity of evidence-based practices for autistic children in schools. Fidelity measurement should be multidimensional and focus on core intervention components and assess their link with program outcomes. This study evaluated the relation between intervention fidelity ratings from multiple sources, tested the relation between fidelity ratings and child outcomes, and determined the relations between core intervention components and child outcomes in a study of an evidence-based psychosocial intervention designed to promote inclusion of autistic children at school, Remaking Recess. This study extends from a larger randomized controlled trial examining the effect of implementation support on Remaking Recess fidelity and child outcomes. Schools were randomized to receive the intervention or the intervention plus implementation support. Observers, intervention coaches, and school personnel completed fidelity measures to rate completion and quality of intervention delivery. A measure of peer engagement served as the child outcome. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to determine concordance between raters. Two sets of hierarchical linear models were conducted using fidelity indices as predictors of peer engagement. Coach- and self-rated completion and quality scores, observer- and self-rated quality scores, and observer- and coach-rated quality fidelity scores were significantly correlated. Higher observer-rated completion and quality fidelity scores were predictors of higher peer engagement scores. No single intervention component emerged as a significant predictor of peer engagement. This study demonstrates the importance of using a multidimensional approach for measuring fidelity, testing the link between fidelity and child outcomes, and examining how core intervention components may be associated with child outcomes. Future research should clarify how to improve multi-informant reports to provide ""good enough"" ratings of fidelity that provide meaningful information about outcomes in community settings. Fidelity is defined as how closely an intervention is administered in the way the creators intended. Fidelity is important because it allows researchers to determine what exactly is leading to changes. In recent years, there has been an interest in examining fidelity of interventions for autistic children who receive services in school. This study looked at the relationship between fidelity ratings from multiple individuals, the relationship between fidelity and child outcomes, and the relationship between individual intervention component and child changes in a study of Remaking Recess, an intervention for autistic children at school. Schools were randomly selected to receive the intervention only or the intervention plus implementation support from the research team. Observers, intervention coaches, and individuals delivering the intervention themselves completed fidelity measures. Child engagement with peers was measured before and after the intervention. Several measures of self-, coach-, and observer-report fidelity were associated with each other. Higher observer-reported fidelity was associated with higher child peer engagement scores. No single intervention step was linked to child peer engagement and both treatment groups had similar outcomes in terms of fidelity. This study shows the importance of having multiple raters assess different parts of intervention fidelity, looking at the link between fidelity and child outcomes, and seeing how individual intervention steps may be related to outcomes. Future research should aim to find out which types of fidelity ratings are ""good enough"" to lead to positive changes following treatment so that those aspects can be used and targeted in the future.","Tagavi Daina M, Ahlers Kaitlyn, Bravo Alice, McVey Alana J, Locke Jill",Implementation research and practice,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37091539,"Department of Psychology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.; Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, NH, USA."

Causes of these problems are multifaceted, but culminate in difficulties with interacting in daily life social situations. Current treatments have only moderate effects on social functioning and often target one specific domain. Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to improve the treatment of social interaction difficulties. We developed a modular VR treatment for social functioning and participation (VR-SOAP). In this study, the effect of this intervention will be investigated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). A total of 116 participants (age 18-40) with a DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorder and problems with social functioning will be recruited from mental healthcare institutes in the Netherlands. Participants will be randomized to the experimental condition (VR-SOAP) or active VR control condition (VRelax). VR-SOAP consists of 14 sessions and 5 modules addressing causes of impaired social functioning: four optional modules (1-4) and one fixed module (5). Vrelax consists of 14 sessions that entail psychoeducation, stress management, relaxation techniques, and the exploration of relaxing environments in VR. Primary outcomes are quantity and quality of social contacts, leisure activities and social participation, measured with the experience sampling method (ESM). Secondary outcomes are psychiatric symptoms, social behaviour, social cognition, self-esteem, self-stigma and paranoid thoughts. Treatment effects will be compared at pre-treatment (baseline), post-treatment and at 6-month follow-up. If VR-SOAP proves to be effective, it provides therapists with a much-needed tool to improve social functioning of young adults with a psychotic disorder. Additionally, since the treatment consists of multiple modules targeting different transdiagnostic factors, this trial might provide input for new treatments to improve social functioning in a range of symptoms and disorders, e.g. mood, autism spectrum and anxiety disorders. On the 10th of November 2021, this trial was registered prospectively in the Dutch Trial Register as NL9784 .","Meins Ivo Alexander, Muijsson-Bouwman Dauw Catharina, Nijman Saskia Anne, Greaves-Lord Kirstin, Veling Wim, Pijnenborg Gerdina Hendrika Maria, van der Stouwe Elisabeth Christine Dorothée",Trials,"Young Adult, Humans, Adolescent, Adult, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Treatment Outcome, Psychotic Disorders, Social Behavior, Virtual Reality, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Multicenter Studies as Topic",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37061694,"University Center of Psychiatry, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.; Department of Clinical and Developmental Neuropsychology, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.; University Center of Psychiatry, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands. i.a.meins@rug.nl.; Jonx Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.; University Center of Psychiatry, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands. d.c.muijsson@umcg.nl."
36990468,10.1503/Jpn.220159,Distinct and shared therapeutic neural mechanisms of mindfulness-based and social support stress reduction groups in adults with autism spectrum disorder.,2023-01-01,"Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) alleviates depression and anxiety in adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD); however, underlying therapeutic neural mechanisms and mindfulness-specific effects have yet to be elucidated. We randomly assigned adults with ASD to MBSR or social support/education (SE). They completed questionnaires that assessed depression, anxiety, mindfulness traits, autistic traits and executive functioning abilities as well as a self-reflection functional MRI task. We used repeated-measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to evaluate behavioural changes. To identify task-specific connectivity changes, we performed a generalized psychophysiological interactions (gPPI) functional connectivity (FC) analysis on regions of interest (ROIs; insula, amygdala, cingulum and prefrontal cortex [PFC]). We used Pearson correlations to explore brain-behaviour relationships. Our final sample included 78 adults with ASD - 39 who received MBSR and 39 who received SE. Mindfulness-based stress reduction uniquely improved executive functioning abilities and increased mindfulness traits, whereas both MBSR and SE groups showed reductions in depression, anxiety and autistic traits. Decreases specific to MBSR in insula-thalamus FC were associated with anxiety reduction and increased mindfulness traits, including the trait ""nonjudgment;"" MBSR-specific decreases in PFC-posterior cingulate connectivity correlated with improved working memory. Both groups showed decreased amygdala-sensorimotor and medial-lateral PFC connectivity, which corresponded with reduced depression. Larger sample sizes and neuropsychological evaluations are needed to replicate and extend these findings. Together, our findings suggest that MBSR and SE are similarly efficacious for depression, anxiety and autistic traits, whereas MBSR produced additional salutary effects related to executive functioning and mindfulness traits. Findings from gPPI identified shared and distinct therapeutic neural mechanisms, implicating the default mode and salience networks. Our results mark an early step toward the development of personalized medicine for psychiatric symptoms in ASD and offer novel neural targets for future neurostimulation research.

The treatment effect was measured using the 6-PAQ, PSS-14, GHQ-12, and WBSI questionnaires. Changes in interactions were assessed through self-recording, including a baseline to observe the previous functioning. Measures were taken before and after the application of the intervention programme and three months later. After that, the control group was switched to the psychological flexibility programme condition. After the programme's implementation, we could see a reduction in stress and the tendency to suppress unwanted private events. The impacts also appeared to apply to family interactions, resulting in a rise in positive interactions and a decrease in unfavourable ones. The results led us to think about the importance of psychological flexibility for the parents of children with chronic conditions, facilitating a reduction in the emotional impact derived from parenting and the emission of behaviours that promote the harmonious development of the diagnosed child.","Lobato David, Montesinos Francisco, Polín Eduardo, Cáliz Saray",International journal of environmental research and public health,"Child, Humans, Intellectual Disability, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Behavior Therapy, Parenting",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36901415,"Department of Psychology, Universidad Europea de Madrid, 28670 Madrid, Spain."

The acceptance and commitment therapy group treatment program seemed logical and reasonable to the participants. Also, when comparing the participants in the NeuroACT group with those in the ordinary care group, the NeuroACT participants reported less stress and higher quality of life. Compared to the ordinary care group, they could also manage distressing thoughts better, perceived themselves as more flexible, and did not avoid stressful situations as much as before. However, there was no significant difference between the groups in depression, anxiety, sleep problems, social aspects of autism, everyday functioning, or executive challenges.

However, it is costly and requires extensive resources to be effective. This inaccessibility is also further worsened by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, making the shift to a digital approach a sensible option. Among the available ASD therapies, parent-mediated interventions (PMIs) have a broad application and lower implementation cost. Hence, this systematic review aims to evaluate the potential that telehealth-based PMI holds and explore its feasibility throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. To build up this study, a systematic search through PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, Wiley, and Cochrane was performed until 14 January 2021. Using the preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines, we ultimately included six studies in the review. Each study was evaluated utilizing the Cochrane Risk of Bias (ROB)-2 tool. Generally, parents' outcomes (knowledge, satisfaction, and compliance) were higher in intervention group (E-learning) compared to control (standard treatment or wait-list). Children also showed some improvements in social skill, communication skill, and intelligence after receiving the treatment. In addition, coaching or therapist sessions were found to be crucial as adjuvant to support parents during the intervention. In conclusion, internet-based parent-mediated interventions are promising and recommended for managing ASD patients, in the face of pandemic. However, more variety in study locations is also needed, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, to tackle the knowledge and clinical application gap.

ASD children were divided randomly into an experimental group and a control group. The experimental group received 18 rTMS sessions (twice a week for nine weeks), whereas the control group received the same procedures with sham stimulation. Directed transfer function (DTF) was used to calculate the effective connectivity as a way of investigating differences between ASD and TD children while simultaneously evaluating the effectiveness of rTMS for ASD. The results illustrate that the DTF of TD children in the frontal lobe (Fp1, Fp2, F7, F8) and temporal lobe (T7, T8) is higher than that of ASD children in all frequency bands; however, the DTF of ASD children is higher than TD in the midline (Fz, Cz), central lobe (C3, C4), and parietal lobe (P3, P4).

36279220,10.1037/Ccp0000755,Change during cognitive and exposure phases of cognitive-behavioral therapy for autistic youth with anxiety disorders.,2022-09-01,"To evaluate improvement during the (a) cognitive and (b) exposure therapy phases of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for autistic youth with anxiety disorders. Participants were 148 autistic youth (aged 7-13; 77% male; 64% White) with clinically significant anxiety who were randomized to standard or adapted CBT. Clinician-rated anxiety severity was recorded at each appointment. Trajectories of change during (a) the cognitive phase and (b) the exposure phase of treatment were analyzed using piecewise multilevel modeling. Compared to the psychoeducation and cognitive therapy phases, the exposure phase corresponded with significantly more rapid symptom reduction, b = -.11, 95% CI [-.13, -.071]. This finding was true for standard CBT, which included nine sessions prior to exposure initiation (on average), as well as for CBT personalized for autistic youth, which introduced exposure following the fifth session (on average). In contrast, compared with improvements during initial psychoeducation sessions, the introduction of cognitive skills corresponded with significantly slower symptom reduction, b = .066, 95% CI [.020, .11]. This finding was also true for both adapted and standard CBT. Results underscore the central role of exposure in the treatment of anxiety among autistic youth and question the utility of cognitive strategies without subsequent practice of these skills during exposure. Assuming a working relationship, therapists should consider moving through the preexposure coping phase of CBT quickly. Future research should evaluate the extent to which exposure can maintain its potency while minimizing coping skill preparation.

Thus, an intervention targeting insomnia in ASD seems warranted. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a potentially effective treatment for improving sleep quality and optimizing sleep structure, has already been demonstrated to alleviate insomnia symptoms and sleep disturbance in different neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions. This trial aims to investigate the effects of rTMS on insomnia in patients with ASD. This study is designed to be a double-blind, randomized, and sham-controlled trial with a target sample size of 30 participants (aged 3-13 years) diagnosed with ASD comorbid with insomnia. The intervention phase will comprise 20 sessions of rTMS or sham rTMS applied over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) within four consecutive weeks. The effect of rTMS on insomnia and other symptoms of ASD will be investigated through home-PSG (two consecutive overnights), sleep diary, CSHQ, CARS, ABC, SRS, RBS-R, and metabolomics analysis at baseline and posttreatment. A follow-up assessment 1 month after the intervention will examine the long-term effects. The results of this study may address an important knowledge gap and may provide evidence for the use of rTMS to treat insomnia in ASD. Furthermore, it will elucidate the potential mechanism and link between sleep disorders and clinical symptoms.

Consultation records from intervention sessions and parent surveys were qualitatively analysed post hoc using a hybrid approach to thematic analysis. Findings were categorised under the seven themes of the TFA (affective attitude, burden, ethicality, intervention coherence, opportunity costs, perceived effectiveness, self-efficacy) in addition to three themes that were defined following inductive and deductive coding (barriers to implementation, facilitators to implementation, suggestions for improvement). Participants spoke positively about their experience participating in the intervention and perceived the intervention to be appropriate and effective. Most parents (95.5%) reported that they would recommend the Sleeping Sound intervention to other families of autistic children. Barriers to implementation included child and parent anxiety, child health problems, parental preferences, family circumstances, and other (e.g., school holidays). Facilitators to implementation included family support and consistency with strategies. The Sleeping Sound intervention was considered acceptable to parents of autistic children as evidenced by largely positive feedback regarding their experience.

We searched peer-reviewed international literature to identify clinical trials investigating TMS as a treatment for behavioral and cognitive symptoms of IC-ASD. We identified sixteen studies and were able to conduct a meta-analysis on twelve of these studies. Seven were open-label or used neurotypical controls for baseline cognitive data, and nine were controlled trials. In the latter, waitlist control groups were often used over sham TMS. Only one study conducted a randomized, parallel, double-blind, and sham controlled trial. Favorable safety data was reported in low frequency repetitive TMS, high frequency repetitive TMS, and intermittent theta burst studies. Compared to TMS research of other neuropsychiatric conditions, significantly lower total TMS pulses were delivered in treatment and neuronavigation was not regularly utilized. Quantitatively, our multivariate meta-analysis results report improvement in cognitive outcomes (pooled Hedges' g = 0.735, 95% CI = 0.242, 1.228; p = 0.009) and primarily Criterion B symptomology of IC-ASD (pooled Hedges' g = 0.435, 95% CI = 0.359, 0.511; p < 0.001) with low frequency repetitive TMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The results of our systematic review and meta-analysis data indicate that TMS may offer a promising and safe treatment option for pediatric and young adult patients with IC-ASD.

Among the hypotheses underlying the involvement of biological and environmental factors, the gut-brain axis is of particular interest in autism spectrum disorders. Several studies have highlighted the related incidence of particular gastrointestinal symptoms (GISs) in children suffering from ASDs. Probiotics have shown success in treating several gastrointestinal dysbiotic disorders; therefore, it is plausible to investigate whether they can alleviate behavioral symptoms as well. On these bases, a randomized double-blind crossover study with a placebo was conducted, evaluating the effects of a mixture of probiotics in a group of 61 subjects aged between 24 months and 16 years old with a diagnosis of ASD. Behavioral evaluation was performed through the administration of a questionnaire including a Parenting Stress Index (PSI) test and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS). The Psycho-Educational Profile and the Autism Spectrum Rating Scale (ASRS) were also evaluated. Microbial composition analyses of fecal samples of the two groups was also performed. The study showed significant improvements in GISs, communication skills, maladaptive behaviors, and perceived parental stress level after the administration of probiotics.

We investigated if attention-based cognitive behavioral treatment, based on mindfulness cognitive therapy (MBCT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), reduces aggressive behavior and improves anger coping in school-aged autistic children (n = 51). Children were randomized to an active-control or a treatment condition. The treatment included nine weekly sessions attention-based individual therapy. Parents in both conditions received three weekly psychoeducation group sessions to heighten awareness of expressed emotion (EE). For aggressive behavior, treatment reduced temper tantrums and arguing. No effect was found on destroying things and physical violence. For anger coping, treatment increased adaptive coping strategies of diffusion and social support seeking, but had no effect on assertion, rumination, and maladaptive coping direct anger out and avoidance. Treatment did not impact secondary outcome measures concerning children's quality of life (QoL) and parental stress-levels and psychological well-being. In conclusion, school-aged autistic children are able to acquire self-regulation skills reducing temper tantrums and arguing and increasing the use of adaptive anger coping strategies. The intervention shows potential to improve behavior and regulation, but little transfer to other domains. Limitations and future directions involving the child's social environment, including parents, siblings, and teachers are discussed. LAY SUMMARY: Children on the autism spectrum often show aggressive behavior. Treatment can train children to be more aware of their emotions.

However, recently, rTMS has gained attention among researchers to find its utility in other neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), tics, and psychosis. There is a lack of systematic data on the safety of rTMS in children and adolescents. The aim of this article was to present an overview of the existing literature on the use of rTMS in children and adolescents and examine the relevant safety considerations.

The period following a child's autism diagnosis can present real challenges in adaptation for families. Twenty to 50% of caregivers show clinically significant levels of mental health need within the post-diagnostic period and on an ongoing basis. Best practice guidelines recommend timely post-diagnostic family support. Current provision is patchy, largely unevidenced, and a source of dissatisfaction for both families and professionals. There is a pressing need for an evidenced programme of post-diagnostic support focusing on caregiver mental health and adjustment, alongside autism psycho-education. This trial tests the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a new brief manualised psychosocial intervention designed to address this gap. This is a multi-centre two-parallel-group single (researcher)-blinded randomised controlled trial of the Empower-Autism programme plus treatment-as-usual versus usual local post-diagnostic offer plus treatment-as-usual. Caregivers of children aged 2-15 years with a recent autism diagnosis will be recruited from North West England NHS or local authority centres.

Thus, we performed an umbrella review of published meta-analyses of controlled clinical trials that investigated the efficacy of psychosocial interventions on both core and related ASD symptoms. Each meta-analysis that was identified was re-estimated using a random-effects model with a restricted maximum likelihood estimator. The methodological quality of included meta-analyses was critically appraised and the credibility of the evidence was assessed algorithmically according to criteria adapted for the purpose of this study. We identified a total of 128 meta-analyses derived from 44 reports. More than half of the non-overlapping meta-analyses were nominally statistically significant and/or displayed a moderate-to-large pooled effect size that favored the psychosocial interventions. The assessment of the credibility of evidence pointed out that the efficacy of early intensive behavioral interventions, developmental interventions, naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions, and parent-mediated interventions was supported by suggestive evidence on at least one outcome in preschool children. Possible outcomes included social communication deficits, global cognitive abilities, and adaptive behaviors. Results also revealed highly suggestive indications that parent-mediated interventions improved disruptive behaviors in early school-aged children. The efficacy of social skills groups was supported by suggestive evidence for improving social communication deficits and overall ASD symptoms in school-aged children and adolescents. Only four meta-analyses had a statistically significant pooled effect size in a sensitivity analysis restricted to randomized controlled trials at low risk of detection bias. This umbrella review confirmed that several psychosocial interventions show promise for improving symptoms related to ASD at different stages of life. However, additional well-designed randomized controlled trials are still required to produce a clearer picture of the efficacy of these interventions.

Some studies have shown that substances derived from Cannabis sativa improve the quality of life of children with ASD without causing serious adverse effects, thus providing an alternative therapeutic option. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a cannabis extract rich in cannabidiol (CBD) in children with ASD. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 60 children, aged from 5 to 11 years, were selected and divided into two groups: the treatment group, which received the CBD-rich cannabis extract, and the control group, which received the placebo. They both used their respective products for a period of 12 weeks. Statistical analysis was done by two-factor mixed analysis of variance (two-way ANOVA). Significant results were found for social interaction (F1,116 = 14.13, p = 0.0002), anxiety (F1,116 = 5.99, p = 0.016), psychomotor agitation (F1,116 = 9.22, p = 0.003), number of meals a day (F1,116 = 4.11, p = 0.04), and concentration (F1,48 = 6.75, p = 0.01), the last of which was only significant in mild ASD cases. Regarding safety, it was found that only three children in the treatment group (9.7%) had adverse effects, namely dizziness, insomnia, colic, and weight gain. CBD-rich cannabis extract was found to improve one of the diagnostic criteria for ASD (social interaction), as well as features that often co-exist with ASD, and to have few serious adverse effects.","Silva Estácio Amaro da, Medeiros Wandersonia Moreira Brito, Santos João Paulo Mendes Dos, Sousa João Marçal Medeiros de, Costa Filipe Barbosa da, Pontes Katiúscia Moreira, Borges Thaís Cavalcanti, Espínola Carlos, Andrade E Silva Ana Hermínia, Nunes Eliane Lima Guerra, Alves Nelson Torro, Rosa Marine Diniz da, Albuquerque Katy Lísias Gondim Dias de",Trends in psychiatry and psychotherapy,"Child, Humans, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Cannabidiol, Cannabis, Double-Blind Method, Plant Extracts, Quality of Life, Child, Preschool",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35617670,"Departamento de Fonoaudiologia, UFPB, João Pessoa, PB, Brazil.; Departamento de Estatística, UFPB, João Pessoa, PB, Brazil.; Programa de Pós-Graduação em Neurociência Cognitiva e Comportamento, Departamento de Psicologia, Universidade Federal da Paraíba (UFPB), João Pessoa, PB, Brazil.; Sociedade Brasileira de Estudos da Cannabis Sativa (SBEC), São Paulo, SP, Brazil.; Sociedade Brasileira de Estudos da Cannabis Sativa (SBEC), São Paulo, SP, Brazil.

We conducted an overview of reviews to synthesize early intervention literature for very young children with or at high likelihood for ASD. Cochrane guidance on how to perform overviews of reviews was followed. Comprehensive searches of databases were conducted for systematic reviews and meta-analyses between January 2009 and December 2020. Review data were extracted and summarized and methodological quality was assessed. Primary randomized controlled trial evidence was summarized and risk of bias assessed. This overview of reviews was not registered. From 762 records, 78 full texts were reviewed and seven systematic reviews and meta-analyses with 63 unique studies were identified. Several interventional approaches (naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention, and developmental and behavioral interventions) improved child developmental outcomes. Heterogeneity in design, intervention and control group, dose, delivery agent, and measurement approach was noted. Inconsistent methodological quality and potential biases were identified. While many early interventional approaches have an impact on child outcomes, study heterogeneity and quality had an impact on our ability to draw firm conclusions regarding which treatments are most effective. Advances in trial methodology and design, and increasing attention to mitigating measurement bias, will advance the quality of the ASD early intervention evidence base. Naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions, as well as developmental and behavioral interventions, improve child outcomes in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). If only randomized controlled trials are considered, guidelines for early intensive behavioral intervention in younger children should be revisited.

This two-armed, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial aimed to investigate the beneficial effects of tDCS combined with concurrent cognitive remediation training on adolescents and young adults with ASD. Participants were randomly assigned to either active or sham tDCS groups and received 1.5 mA prefrontal tDCS with left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) cathode placement and right supraorbital region anode placement for 20 minutes over two consecutive weeks. tDCS was delivered concurrently with a computerized cognitive remediation training program. Social functioning and its underlying cognitive processes, as well as prefrontal resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC), were measured.

35120753,10.1016/J.Encep.2021.08.005,[Therapeutic approaches for sleep and rhythms disorders in children with ASD].,2022-06-01,"Sleep disturbances are extremely common (40-86%) in children and adolescents, especially those with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and are often among the first symptoms identified by parents at a very early stage of their child's development. These abnormalities are among the main parental concerns when having a child with ASD and have a significant impact on the quality of life of patients, their parents, and more broadly their siblings. Sleep disorders are essentially abnormalities of the sleep-wake rhythm - primarily sleep onset insomnia or nocturnal awakenings (with difficulty falling back to sleep). These disturbances can be accompanied by other sleep disorders, requiring notably a systematic elimination of the presence of a sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome - to ensure a personalized and efficient therapeutic approach. Physiologically, the determinants of these sleep disorders are poorly understood, even though several studies point to a significant decrease in melatonin synthesis in people with ASD. Melatonin is a hormone that facilitates falling asleep and maintaining sleep and is also involved in the endogenous synchronization of internal biological clocks. However, the causal factors of this decrease in melatonin synthesis are largely unknown, involving to a small extent the genes involved in melatonin synthesis pathway. The treatment of sleep disorders is relatively systematic: after eliminating other specific sleep disorders associated with the complaint of insomnia, as well as other possible associated comorbidities (such as seizures), a global and graduated therapeutic approach must be put in place. This treatment will be non-pharmacological as a first line, then pharmacological as a second line. A number of non-pharmacological treatment strategies for sleep disorders in typically developing children and adolescents, as well as those with ASD, have been shown to be effective. This treatment requires a combination of: 1) parental education to promote sleep development; 2) setting up bedtime rituals adapted to the child's age and particularities; 3) specific behavioral strategies including bedtime fading, gradual extinction and positive reinforcement of adapted behaviors. It is very essential that the parents are accompanied throughout this therapy. Sleep hygiene and behavioral care must also take into consideration the important role of the zeitgebers of sleep-wake rhythms, i.e. the external environmental factors involved in the synchronization of the biological clocks: regular exposure to light at adapted times, regular meal and wake-up times, social activities and times for going to school. The evidence for the effectiveness of behavioral interventions in the treatment of behavioral insomnia in the typical developmental child is strong, since 94% of children show clinically significant improvements in nighttime sleepiness and waking. By contrast, only about 25% of children with ASD are improved by an approach combining sleep hygiene and behavioral therapy. Melatonin has a special and prominent place in the drug management of sleep disorders associated with ASD. Several clinical trials have shown that melatonin is effective in treating sleep disorders in patients with ASD. This work led to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granting marketing authorization in September 2018 for a sustained-release paediatric melatonin molecule (Slenyto®). This synthetic molecule is a prolonged release melatonin (PRM) which mimics the physiological pharmacokinetic and secretory characteristics of endogenous melatonin, having a very short blood half-life and prolonged secretion for several hours during the night. A recent study evaluated the efficacy and safety of pediatric PRM (mini-tablets) in 125 children, aged 2 to 17.5 years with mainly ASD. After 15 days on placebo, the children were randomized into two parallel groups, PRM or placebo in a double-blind design for 13 weeks. At endpoint, total sleep time was increased by an average of 57.5 minutes on PRM and only 9.14 minutes on placebo (P=0.034). This difference between the two groups was already significant after three weeks of treatment (P=0.006). Sleep latency was also improved in the PRM group (-39.6 minutes) compared to placebo (-12.51 minutes) (P=0.01). Consolidated sleep duration (uninterrupted by awakenings) was improved by 77.9 minutes for the PRM group and only 25.4 minutes for the placebo group (P<0.001). PRM was well tolerated, the most frequent side effects being headache and daytime drowsiness at the same level with PRM or placebo. In addition, the acceptability by the children for swallowing the mini-tablets was excellent (100% compliance). The efficacy and tolerability of PRM was maintained over the medium and long term in the open phase, over a total study duration of 2 years.","Schröder C M, Broquère M A, Claustrat B, Delorme R, Franco P, Lecendreux M, Tordjman S",L'Encephale,"Adolescent, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Humans, Melatonin, Quality of Life, Sleep, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders, Sleep Wake Disorders",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35120753,"Centre pédiatrique des pathologies du sommeil, hôpital Robert-Debré, 75015 Paris, France; Centre de référence pour la narcolepsie et les hypersomnies idiopathiques et le syndrome de Kleine-Levin (CNR Narcolepsie-Hypersomnie), Paris, France.; Prosom (association nationale de promotion des connaissances du sommeil), 7, place du Griffon, 69001 Lyon, France.; Centre ressource autisme, hôpital La Grave Place Lange, 31300 Toulouse, France.; Service de psychiatrie de l'enfant et de l'adolescent, centre d'excellence pour l'autisme et les troubles du neurodeveloppement inovand, hôpital Robert-Debré, 75019 Paris, France; Génétique humaine et fonctions cognitives, institut Pasteur, 75015 Paris, France.; Service de psychiatrie de l'enfant et de l'adolescent, centre d'excellence pour l'autisme et les troubles du neurodéveloppement STRAS&ND, hôpitaux universitaires de Strasbourg, université de Strasbourg, 67000 Strasbourg, France; CNRS UPR 3212, institut des neurosciences cellulaires et intégratives, 67000 Strasbourg, France; Centre des troubles du sommeil, centre international de recherche en chronosomnologie (CIRCSom), hôpitaux universitaires de Strasbourg, 1, place de l'Hôpital, 67000 Strasbourg, France.

The current feasibility study used MRI-derived diffusion imaging data to investigate whether it would be possible to identify neural biomarkers of a behavioral intervention among people diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The corpus callosum has been linked to cognitive processing and callosal abnormalities have been previously found in people diagnosed with ASD. We used a case-control design to evaluate the association between the type of intervention people diagnosed with ASD had previously received and their current white matter integrity in the corpus callosum. Twenty-six children and adolescents with ASD, with and without a history of parent-managed behavioral intervention, underwent an MRI scan with a diffusion data acquisition sequence. We conducted tract-based spatial statistics and a region of interest analysis. The fractional anisotropy values (believed to indicate white matter integrity) in the posterior corpus callosum was significantly different across cases (exposed to parent-managed behavioral intervention) and controls (not exposed to parent-managed behavioral intervention). The effect was modulated by the intensity of the behavioral intervention according to a dose-response relationship. The current feasibility case-control study provides the basis for estimating the statistical power required for future RCTs in this field.

The autistic children were divided randomly and equally into an experimental group and a control group. 16 children (three girls and 13 boys; mean ± SD age: 7.8 ± 2.1 years) who received rTMS treatment twice a week were served as the experimental group, while 16 children (three girls and 13 boys; mean ± SD age: 7.2 ± 1.6 years) with sham stimulation were considered as the control group. Recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) was employed to quantify the nonlinear features of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals recorded during the resting state. Three RQA measures, including recursive rate (RR), deterministic (DET) and mean diagonal length (L) were extracted from the EEG signals to characterize the deterministic features of cortical activity. Significant differences in RR and DET were observed between the experimental group and the control group. We also found discernible discrepancies in the Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) score pre- and post-rTMS for the experimental group. 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) could positively influence brain activity and behavior of autistic children with intellectual disability.","Kang Jiannan, Zhang Zhiming, Wan Lingyan, Casanova Manuel F, Sokhadze Estate M, Li Xiaoli",Computers in biology and medicine,"Autistic Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Electroencephalography, Female, Humans, Intellectual Disability, Male, Pilot Projects, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34959111,"College of Electronic & Information Engineering, Hebei University, Baoding, China.; State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.

Identifying these subgroups may contribute to hypotheses about differential treatment responses. The present study aimed to discern subgroups among children with ASD and anxiety in context of the five-factor model of personality (FFM) and evaluate treatment response differences to two cognitive-behavioral therapy treatments. The present study is a secondary data analysis of children with ASD and anxiety (<i>N</i>=202; ages 7-13; 20.8% female) in a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) randomized controlled trial (Wood et al., 2020). Subgroups were identified via latent profile analysis of parent-reported FFM data. Treatment groups included <i>standard-of-practice CBT</i> (CC), designed for children with anxiety, and <i>adapted CBT</i> (BIACA), designed for children with ASD and comorbid anxiety. Five subgroups with distinct profiles were extracted. Analysis of covariance revealed CBT response was contingent on subgroup membership. Two subgroups responded better to BIACA on the primary outcome measure and a third responded better to BIACA on a peer-social adaptation measure, while a fourth subgroup responded better to CC on a school-related adaptation measure. These findings suggest that the FFM may be useful in empirically identifying subgroups of children with ASD, which could inform intervention selection decisions for children with ASD and anxiety.","Cho Anchuen, Wood Jeffrey J, Ferrer Emilio, Rosenau Kashia, Storch Eric A, Kendall Philip C",Development and psychopathology,"Child, Humans, Female, Male, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Anxiety Disorders, Anxiety, Comorbidity, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34866567,"University of California, Los Angeles, 405 Hilgard Ave., 3132A Moore Hall, Los Angeles, CA90095, USA.; Baylor College of Medicine, 7200 Cambridge St, Houston, TX77030, USA.; Temple University, 1701 North 13th St., Weiss Hall, Philadelphia, PA19122, USA.; University of California, Davis, 1 Shields Ave., 135 Young Hall, Davis, CA95616, USA."

34693989,10.1002/14651858.Cd013173.Pub2,Behavioural and cognitive behavioural therapy for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).,2021-09-03,"Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) is an increasingly recognised neurodevelopmental condition; that is, a neurologically-based condition which interferes with the acquisition, retention or application of specific skills. ASD is characterised by challenges with socialisation and communication, and by stereotyped and repetitive behaviours. A stereotyped behaviour is one which is repeated over and over again and which seems not to have any useful function. ASD often co-occurs with mental health disorders, including obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). People with ASD may show certain cognitive differences (i.e. differences in ways of thinking) which influence their response to therapies. Thus, there is a need for evidence-based guidelines to treat mental health issues in this group. OCD, a common condition characterised by repeated obsessional thoughts and compulsive acts, occurs with greater frequency in persons with ASD than in the general population. Genetic, anatomic, neurobiological and psychological factors have been proposed to explain this co-occurrence. However, care should be taken to distinguish stereotyped and repetitive behaviours characteristic of ASD from obsessive compulsive acts in OCD. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the recommended treatment for OCD, but studies have suggested that this treatment may be less effective in those with OCD co-occurring with ASD. Hence, modifications to CBT treatment may be helpful when treating OCD co-occurring with ASD to optimise outcomes. To assess the effectiveness of behavioural and cognitive behavioural therapy for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in children and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We searched for studies in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, five other bibliographic databases, international trial registries and other sources of grey literature (to 24 August 2020). We checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews to identify additional studies missed from the original electronic searches. We contacted subject experts for further information when needed. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cross-over, cluster- and quasi-randomised controlled trials involving both adults and children with diagnoses of OCD and ASD. We included studies of participants with co-occurring conditions (i.e. those experiencing other mental illnesses or neurodevelopmental conditions at the same time), but we did not include individuals who had a co-occurring global learning difficulty. Treatment could be in any setting or format and include behavioural therapy (BT) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which may have been adapted for those with ASD. Comparator interventions included no treatment, waiting list, attention placebo (where the control group receives non-specific aspects of therapy, but not the active ingredient) and treatment as usual (TAU, where the control group receives the usual treatment, according to accepted standards). Three review authors independently screened studies for inclusion. The authors extracted relevant data from the one eligible study, assessed the risk of bias and certainty of evidence (GRADE). Outcomes of interest were changes in OCD symptoms and treatment completion (primary outcome), and severity of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and behavioural difficulties, as well as degree of family accommodation (secondary outcomes). We did not conduct meta-analyses as only one study met the selection criteria. We included only one RCT of 46 participants in our analysis. This study compared CBT for OCD in persons with high-functioning ASD with a control group who received anxiety management only. There were no differences in rates of treatment completion between the CBT (87%) and anxiety management (87%) groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.25; low-certainty evidence). Behavioural difficulties were not included as an outcome measure in the study. This study showed that there may be a benefit at the end of treatment favouring CBT compared with anxiety management in OCD symptoms (mean difference (MD) -3.00, 95% CI -8.02 to 2.02), depression symptoms (MD -1.80, 95% CI -11.50 to 7.90), anxiety symptoms (MD -3.20, 95% CI -11.38 to 4.98), and quality of life (MD 5.20, 95% CI -1.41 to 11.81), but the evidence was of low certainty.  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence is limited regarding the efficacy of CBT for treatment of OCD in ASD. There is much scope for future study, not only examining the efficacy of CBT for OCD in ASD, but also the particular ways that OCD manifests in and affects people with ASD and the role of the family in treatment response.","Elliott Sarah J, Marshall David, Morley Karen, Uphoff Eleonora, Kumar Mrityunjai, Meader Nicholas",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Adult, Anxiety, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Child, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Humans, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34693989,"Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, University of York, York, UK.; Wigan Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service, Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust, Wigan, UK.; Elm House, East Cheshire Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service, Cheshire and Wirral Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, Macclesfield, UK.; Cochrane Consumer Network, York, UK."

Interventions using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to enhance or inhibit cortical excitability are under study for various targets, though the mechanistic effects of rTMS have yet to be examined in ASD. Here, we examined whether an excitatory rTMS treatment course modulates glutamatergic (Glx) or γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) metabolite levels in emerging adults with ASD. Twenty-eight participants with ASD and executive function impairment [23.3 ± 4.69 years; seven-female] underwent two magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) scans of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). MRS scans were acquired before and after participants with ASD were randomized to receive a 20-session course of active or sham rTMS to the DLPFC. Baseline MRS data was available for 19 typically developing controls [23.8 ± 4.47 years; six-female]. Metabolite levels for Glx and GABA+ were compared between ASD and control groups, at baseline, and metabolite level change, pre-to-post-rTMS treatment, was compared in ASD participants that underwent active vs. sham rTMS. Absolute change in Glx was greater in the active vs. sham-rTMS group [<i>F</i> <sub>(1,</sub> <sub>19)</sub> = 6.54, <i>p</i> = 0.02], though the absolute change in GABA+ did not differ between groups. We also examined how baseline metabolite levels related to pre/post-rTMS metabolite level change, in the active vs. sham groups. rTMS group moderated the relation between baseline Glx and pre-to-post-rTMS Glx change, such that baseline Glx predicted Glx change in the active-rTMS group only [<i>b</i> = 1.52, <i>SE</i> = 0.32, <i>t</i> <sub>(18)</sub> = 4.74, <i>p</i> < 0.001]; Glx levels increased when baseline levels were lower, and decreased when baseline levels were higher. Our results indicate that an interventional course of excitatory rTMS to the DLPFC may modulate local Glx levels in emerging adults with ASD, and align with prior reports of glutamatergic alterations following rTMS. Interventional studies that track glutamatergic markers may provide mechanistic insights into the therapeutic potential of rTMS in ASD. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> Clinicaltrials.gov (ID: NCT02311751), https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02311751?term=ameis&rank=1; NCT02311751.","Moxon-Emre Iska, Daskalakis Zafiris J, Blumberger Daniel M, Croarkin Paul E, Lyon Rachael E, Forde Natalie J, Tani Hideaki, Truong Peter, Lai Meng-Chuan, Desarkar Pushpal, Sailasuta Napapon, Szatmari Peter, Ameis Stephanie H",Frontiers in neuroscience,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34690671,"Research Imaging Centre, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry and Psychology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States.; Cundill Centre for Child and Youth Depression, The Margaret and Wallace McCain Centre for Child, Youth & Family Mental Health, Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Temerty Centre for Therapeutic Brain Intervention, Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada."

To assess whether behavioral interventions in children and adolescents with neurodevelopmental or mental health disorders are associated with improvements in social function and social cognition, and whether patient, intervention, and methodological characteristics moderate the association. For this systematic review and meta-analysis, the PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and PubMed electronic databases were searched in December 2020 for randomized clinical trials published from database inception to December 1, 2020, including terms related to neurodevelopmental or mental health disorders, social behavior, randomized clinical trials, and children and adolescents. Data were analyzed in January 2021. Randomized clinical trials that enrolled participants aged 4 to 17 years with social deficits and examined the efficacy of a clinician-administered behavioral intervention targeting social functioning or social cognition were included. A total of 9314 records were identified, 78 full texts were assessed for eligibility, and 33 articles were included in the study; 31 of these reported social function outcomes and 12 reported social cognition outcomes. Articles were reviewed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment for randomized clinical trials. Data were independently extracted and pooled using a weighted random-effects model. The main outcome was the association of behavioral intervention with social function and social cognition. Hedges g was used to measure the standardized mean difference between intervention and control groups. Standardized effect sizes were calculated for the intervention group vs the comparison group for each trial. A total of 31 trials including 2131 participants (1711 [80%] male; 420 [20%] female; mean [SD] age, 10.8 [2.2] years) with neurodevelopmental or mental health disorders (autism spectrum disorder [ASD] [n = 23], attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [n = 4], other conditions associated with social deficits [n = 4]) were analyzed to examine differences in social function between the intervention and control groups. Significantly greater gains in social function were found among participants who received an intervention than among the control groups (Hedges g, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.40-0.83; P < .001). The type of control condition (wait list vs active control vs treatment as usual) was a significant moderator of effect size (Q2, 7.11; P = .03). Twelve studies including 487 individuals with ASD (48 [10%] female; 439 [90%] male; mean [SD] age, 10.4 [1.7] years) were analyzed to examine differences in social cognition between intervention and control groups. The overall mean weighted effect was significant (Hedges g, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.39-0.96; P < .001), indicating the treatment groups had better performance on social cognitive tasks. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, significantly greater gains in social function and social cognition were reported among children and adolescents who received behavioral interventions for social deficits compared with participants receiving the control conditions. These findings suggest that children and adolescents with social deficits might benefit from social skills training regardless of their specific neurodevelopmental or mental health diagnosis.","Darling Simone J, Goods Marquelle, Ryan Nicholas P, Chisholm Anita K, Haebich Kristina, Payne Jonathan M",JAMA pediatrics,"Adolescent, Behavior Therapy, Child, Female, Humans, Male, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Social Behavior, Social Cognition, Social Skills",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34661613,"Clinical Sciences, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia."

In a series of studies, we aimed to elucidated the effects of sex, age, and their interaction on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and evaluated the effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) for improving health-, disability-, and autism-related QoL, with possible sex and age outcome moderators, in adults with ASD. Study 1 used the 36-Item Short Form Survey to compare mental and physical HRQoL composite scores in adults with ASD (n = 67) and matched NT adults (n = 66). Study 2 was a randomized pilot evaluation of the effect of MBSR, compared to an active control intervention with social support and relaxation education (support/education; n = 56), on the World Health Organization QoL BREF, Disability, and Autism-Specific scales in adults with ASD. In Study 1, we replicated findings that mental HRQoL is worse in both men and women with ASD, compared to NT counterparts, but physical HRQoL is only worse in women with ASD. We present novel findings that older age is associated with better mental HRQoL in women with ASD only. In Study 2, MBSR improved disability-related QoL in adults with ASD over and above the support/education intervention, but both interventions improved mental HRQoL. Lastly, both interventions were more effective for HRQoL improvements in women with ASD. Findings encourage precision medicine approaches tailored to age and sex groups for best HRQoL outcomes in adults with ASD. gov Identifier: NCT04017793.","Braden B Blair, Pagni Broc A, Monahan Leanna, Walsh Melissa J M, Dixon Maria V, Delaney Shanna, Ballard Lisa, Ware John E","Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation","Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Female, Humans, Male, Mindfulness, Pilot Projects, Quality of Life, Social Support, Stress, Psychological",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34655389,"College of Health Solutions, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA.; College of Health Solutions, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA. bbbraden@asu.edu."
34527087,,Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder or Acute Stress Disorder: A Health Technology Assessment.,2021-01-01,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and acute stress disorder (ASD) are mental health conditions that may emerge following a frightening or traumatic event in a person's life. We conducted a health technology assessment of internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) for adults with PTSD or ASD, which included an evaluation of effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness, the budget impact of publicly funding iCBT for PTSD or ADS, and patient preferences and values. We performed a systematic literature search of the clinical evidence. We assessed the risk of bias of systematic reviews using ROBIS and of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, and the quality of the body of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria.We performed a systematic economic literature search to summarize the economic evidence on the cost-effectiveness of iCBT for adults with PTSD or ASD. We did not conduct a primary economic evaluation on iCBT for adults with PTSD, as an existing cost-utility analysis is directly applicable to this research question. We did not conduct a primary economic evaluation on iCBT for adults with ASD, as there is limited clinical evidence on this topic and because evidence on iCBT for PTSD may be generalizable to iCBT for ASD at risk of progressing to PTSD. We analyzed the budget impact of publicly funding iCBT for adults with PTSD or ASD in Ontario over the next 5 years.To contextualize the potential value of iCBT for PTSD, we reviewed relevant literature on patients' preferences and values and spoke with people who have lived experience with PTSD to explore their values, needs, and priorities. We identified no studies on the use of iCBT for prevention of PTSD or studies on the use of iCBT to treat ASD, nor studies that directly compared iCBT with face-to-face CBT for the treatment of PTSD. We included one systematic review of the use of iCBT to treat PTSD (10 RCTs, N = 720). Overall, iCBT is more effective than wait-list (waiting for iCBT) or usual care alone for reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.60 [95% CI -0.97 to -0.24]; N = 560, 8 RCTs) (GRADE: Very low). Internet-delivered CBT is not more effective than non-CBT internet-delivered interventions for reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms (SMD = -0.08 [-0.52 to 0.35]; N = 82, 2 RCTs) (GRADE: Very low).We identified one economic evaluation on the cost-effectiveness of iCBT for adults with PTSD. For adults with PTSD, iCBT was found to be dominant (i.e., less costly and more effective) compared with usual care. The model used a Canadian public health care payer perspective, and there were no major limitations to the model structure, time horizon, or source of model inputs. The annual budget impact of publicly funding iCBT in Ontario over the next 5 years ranges from an additional $2.43 million in year 1 to $2.37 million in year 5, for a total additional cost of $16.53 million over the next 5 years. If treatment costs alone are considered, the annual budget impact ranges from an additional $3.37 million in year 1 to $17.84 million in year 5, for a total additional cost of $52.61 million over the next 5 years.Our review of the quantitative literature on patient preferences found that adults with PTSD may experience iCBT as a generally acceptable form of treatment, but there is uncertainty in the evidence due to incomplete follow-up in studies and variability in the nature and extent of the therapist-patient relationship. The 10 people we spoke with had all been diagnosed with PTSD. They reported on its negative impact on their quality of life, including difficulty in managing everyday activities, relationships, and employment. Participants viewed iCBT as beneficial to managing their PTSD symptoms but stressed the importance of combining it with face-to-face CBT. However, wait times for PTSD services are long, and out-of-pocket expenses could be a barrier for people without private insurance. Internet-delivered CBT may reduce the severity of PTSD symptoms compared with wait-list or usual care, but the evidence is very uncertain, and iCBT may have little to no effect on improving PTSD symptoms compared with non-CBT interventions delivered online, but here as well the evidence is very uncertain.For adults with PTSD, iCBT may be cost-effective compared with usual care. We estimate that publicly funding iCBT in Ontario would result in additional costs of between $2.37 million and $2.43 million per year over the next 5 years.People with PTSD seem to generally find iCBT as an acceptable treatment option. People with PTSD with whom we spoke viewed iCBT to be effective and recommended it be combined with in-person psychotherapy.", ,Ontario health technology assessment series,"Adult, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Humans, Internet, Ontario, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic, Stress Disorders, Traumatic, Acute, Systematic Reviews as Topic, Technology Assessment, Biomedical",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34527087,

In the present study, a personalized measure of autism-related symptoms using the Youth Top Problems (YTP) method (Weisz et al., 2011) was evaluated. Participants included 68 children with diagnoses of autism (ages 6-13 years), and their parents, who were randomized to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or enhanced standard community treatment (ESCT) addressing autism-related symptoms. At pretreatment, parents described their child's top autism-related problems (YTPs) in their own words and rated the severity of these problems on a Likert-type scale. Parents also made daily severity ratings on the child's top three YTPs for 5 days prior to treatment and 5 days following treatment while videorecording their child's behavior at home on each of these days. Trained observers coded these videorecordings, focusing on the same YTPs that the parents rated. Parents also completed standardized checklists of autism-related symptoms and general mental health symptoms. There was evidence of convergent and discriminant validity as well as good test-retest reliability for the YTP measures. YTP severity scores converged with the standardized measure of autism-related symptoms. Parent-reported YTP scores predicted observers' YTP scores at the daily level, and both parent-reported and observers' YTP scores decreased from pre- to post treatment. Observers' ratings of the videorecordings exhibited sensitivity to treatment condition. These applications of the YTP method are promising and may complement standardized symptom checklists for clinical trials focusing on autism-related symptoms.

34432543,10.1089/Can.2020.0154,Safety and Efficacy of Medical Cannabis in Autism Spectrum Disorder Compared with Commonly Used Medications.,2022-08-01,"<b>Objective:</b> The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of medications commonly used in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and compare this to what current research has shown regarding medical cannabis use in this population. <b>Methods:</b> Searches were performed to collect information surrounding currently used medications and their safety and efficacy profiles, biologic plausibility of cannabis use for symptoms of ASD, and studies detailing cannabis' safety and efficacy profile for use in the ASD population. Results were used to compare medications to cannabis as a proposed treatment. <b>Results:</b> The heterogeneity of ASD produces great difficulties in finding appropriate treatment, leading to many medication changes or treatment trials throughout a patient's life. Commonly prescribed medications display varying levels of efficacy, safety, and tolerability between patients and symptoms targeted. Some of the most common side effects cited are also considered the most troubling symptoms associated with ASD; aggression, anxiety, irritability, and a negative effect on cognition, leading many patients to discontinue use as the side effects outweigh benefits. Recent case reports and retrospective studies have displayed the potential efficacy, safety, and tolerability of cannabidiol (CBD)-rich medical cannabis use for treating both core symptoms of ASD and many comorbid symptoms such as irritability and sleep problems. Studies have also identified circulating endocannabinoids as a possible biomarker for ASD, providing another possible method of diagnosis. <b>Conclusions:</b> Currently, there are no approved medications for the core symptoms of ASD and only two medications Food and Drug Administration approved for associated irritability. Prescribed medications for symptoms associated with ASD display varying levels of efficacy, safety, and tolerability among the heterogeneous ASD population. At the time of this study there are no published placebo-controlled trials of medical cannabis for ASD and the observational studies have limitations. CBD-rich medical cannabis seems to be an effective, tolerable, and relatively safe option for many symptoms associated with ASD, however, the long-term safety is unknown at this time.","Holdman Richard, Vigil Daniel, Robinson Kelsey, Shah Puja, Contreras Alexandra Elyse",Cannabis and cannabinoid research,"Autism Spectrum Disorder, Cannabidiol, Cannabis, Hallucinogens, Humans, Medical Marijuana, Retrospective Studies, United States",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34432543,"Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, Marijuana Health Monitoring and Research, Denver, Colorado, USA."

Our study aimed to explore the impacts of intermittent TBS (iTBS) over the bilateral posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) on intellectually able adults with ASD. In this randomized, single-blinded, sham-controlled crossover trial, 13 adults with ASD completed iTBS for 5 consecutive days over the bilateral pSTS and inion (as a sham control) in a 16-weeks interval and in a randomly assigned order. The neuropsychological function was measured with the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) for cognitive flexibility while the clinical outcomes were measured with both self-rate and parents-rate Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) before and after 5-day iTBS interventions. The results revealed significantly immediate effects of multi-session iTBS over the bilateral pSTS on parent-rate autistic symptoms in adults with ASD. The post-hoc analysis revealed the impacts of multi-session iTBS on cognitive flexibility were affected by baseline social-communicative impairment and baseline cognitive performance. Besides, the impacts of multi-session iTBS on clinical symptoms was affected by the concurrent psychotropic medication use and baseline autistic symptoms. Given the caveat of the small sample size and discrepancy of multiple informants, this pilot study suggests the therapeutic potential of 5-day multi-session iTBS over the pSTS in adults with ASD. Individual factors modulating the response to rTMS should be explicitly considered in the future trial.","Ni Hsing-Chang, Lin Hsiang-Yuan, Chen Yi-Lung, Hung June, Wu Chen-Te, Wu Yu-Yu, Liang Hsin-Yi, Chen Rou-Shayn, Gau Susan Shur-Fen, Huang Ying-Zu",Biomedical journal,"Adult, Humans, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Pilot Projects, Temporal Lobe, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Cross-Over Studies",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34358713,"Neuroscience Research Center and Department of Neurology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan.; Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Brain and Mind Sciences, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.

Across two studies, we assess predictors of the development of PTSD in young children (PTSD-YC), including the adult-led acute stress disorder (ASD) diagnosis, and provide proof of principle for cognitive-focused therapy for this age range, with the aim of increasing treatment options for children diagnosed with PTSD-YC. Study 1 (N = 105) assessed ASD and PTSD-YC diagnosis in 3- to 8-year-old children within one month and at around three months following attendance at an emergency room. Study 2 (N = 37) was a preregistered (www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN35018680) randomized controlled early-phase trial comparing CBT-3M, a cognitive-focused intervention, to treatment-as-usual (TAU) delivered within the UK NHS to 3- to 8-year-olds diagnosed with PTSD-YC.

However, a link between oxytocin and trust in humans was discovered only in one early study. We hypothesized that there is a large interindividual variation in oxytocin sensitivity, and that such variation is one reason for the doubt surrounding the role of oxytocin in trusting behavior. Here, in a double-blind, prospective, case-control study, we administered intranasal oxytocin to participants of trust and risk games. We measured salivary oxytocin concentration, relating it to the amount of money transferred among participants (a proxy for trust) and the autism-spectrum quotient (AQ). A one-sided Fisher's exact test was performed to detect differences between the oxytocin and placebo groups in the proportions of investors who transferred the maximum amount of money. We discovered a tendency for participants who received oxytocin to transfer higher amounts of money to co-participants than those who received a placebo (<i>P</i> = 0.04). We also revealed a high degree of interindividual variation in salivary oxytocin concentrations after oxytocin administration. After stratifying the samples with respect to oxytocin sensitivity, oxytocin-sensitive participants in the oxytocin group also transferred higher amounts of money than those in the placebo group (<i>P</i> = 0.03), while such a tendency was not observed for oxytocin-insensitive participants (<i>P</i> = 0.34). Participants with lower AQ scores (less severe autistic traits) exhibited a greater tendency toward trusting behavior after oxytocin administration than did those with higher AQ scores (<i>P</i> = 0.02). A two-sample <i>t</i>-test that was performed to detect significant differences in the mean transfers between the oxytocin and placebo groups indicated no significant between-group difference in the mean transfers (<i>P</i> = 0.08). There are two possible interpretations of these results: First, there is no effect of oxytocin on trust in humans; second, the effects of oxytocin on trust in humans is person-dependent. However, the results should be interpreted with caution as the effect size was not larger than the minimal detectable effect size and the results were not statistically significant (<i>P</i> > 0.05) after Bonferroni corrections.","Kurokawa Hirofumi, Kinari Yusuke, Okudaira Hiroko, Tsubouchi Kiyotaka, Sai Yoshimichi, Kikuchi Mitsuru, Higashida Haruhiro, Ohtake Fumio",Frontiers in neuroscience,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34113232,"Hirao School of Management, Konan University, Nishinomiya, Japan.; Department of Psychiatry and Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.; Research Center for Child Mental Development, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.; Center for Infectious Disease Education and Research, Osaka University, Suita, Japan.; Department of Hospital Pharmacy, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.; School of Economics and Management, University of Hyogo, Kobe, Japan.; Doshisha Business School, Doshisha University, Kyoto, Japan."

This study examines the implementation of Reciprocal Imitation Training (RIT)-an NDBI-by community Early Intervention (EI; IDEA Part C) providers serving toddlers from birth to 3 years. Of the 87 EI providers enrolled from 9 agencies in 4 counties across Washington State, 66 were included in the current sample. A stepped-wedge design was used to randomly assign counties to the timing of RIT training workshops. Self-report measures of practice and self-efficacy regarding ASD care were collected at baseline (T1, T2) and 6-months and 12-months post-training (T3, T4). At T3 and T4, providers reported on RIT adoption and rated items about RIT feasibility and perceived RIT effectiveness; at T4, they also reported on child characteristics that led to RIT use and modifications. From pre-training to post-training, there were significant increases in providers' self-efficacy in providing services to children with ASD or suspected ASD. At T3 and T4, provider ratings indicated high levels of RIT adoption, feasibility, and perceived RIT effectiveness. At T4, providers indicated that they most commonly: (a) initiated RIT when there were social-communication or motor imitation delays, or an ASD diagnosis; and (b) made modifications to RIT by repeating elements, blending it with other therapies, and loosening its structure. While additional research is needed, RIT may help families get an early start on accessing specialized treatment within an established infrastructure available across the United States. LAY SUMMARY: Reciprocal imitation training (RIT) is an evidence-based treatment for ASD that might be a good fit for use by intervention providers in widely accessible community-based settings.

The efficacy and safety of tezepelumab in patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma require further assessment. We conducted a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients (12 to 80 years of age) were randomly assigned to receive tezepelumab (210 mg) or placebo subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 52 weeks. The primary end point was the annualized rate of asthma exacerbations over a period of 52 weeks. This end point was also assessed in patients with baseline blood eosinophil counts of less than 300 cells per microliter. Secondary end points included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and scores on the Asthma Control Questionnaire-6 (ACQ-6; range, 0 [no impairment] to 6 [maximum impairment]), Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ; range, 1 [maximum impairment] to 7 [no impairment]), and Asthma Symptom Diary (ASD; range, 0 [no symptoms] to 4 [worst possible symptoms]). Overall, 1061 patients underwent randomization (529 were assigned to receive tezepelumab and 532 to receive placebo). The annualized rate of asthma exacerbations was 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80 to 1.07) with tezepelumab and 2.10 (95% CI, 1.84 to 2.39) with placebo (rate ratio, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.53; P<0.001).

Ten studies were conducted with patients with affective disorders, six with healthy participants, two with schizophrenia patients, two with OCD patients, and one study each with patients suffering from central neuropathic pain, autistic disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The best outcomes were obtained after 20 sessions of high-frequency dTMS with OCD patients, where, in addition to clinical improvement, patients showed amelioration of cognitive functions, specifically in cognitive control domains. The studies on patients with depression appear to show inconsistent results, from cognitive improvement in open-label studies to no improvement versus sham dTMS in controlled trials. Experimental research in healthy volunteers suggests an influence of dTMS on memory and self-agency, and also contain contradictory results. Most studies did not demonstrate a significant improvement in cognitive functioning.

The majority of adult ASD patients suffer from comorbid conditions such as depression and anxiety. Therapy options for adult ASD patients are lacking, with presently no available evidence-based interventions in Germany. Recently, two interventions to improve social responsiveness have been published. FASTER (""Freiburger Asperger-Spezifische Therapie für ERwachsene"" = Freiburg Asperger-specific therapy for adults) is a manualized group psychotherapy program including three modules on psychoeducation, stress regulation management, and non-verbal and verbal social communication training with videotaped tasks. SCOTT&EVA (""Social Cognition Training Tool"", and its enhancement ""Emotionen Verstehen und Ausdruecken"" = understanding and expressing emotions) is a computer-based training program to enhance social cognition including video and audio material of emotional expressions and complex real-life social situations. Initial studies for both programs have shown good feasibility and efficacy. Three hundred sixty adult participants with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) will take part in a randomized controlled three-armed multi-center trial to prove the efficacy of manualized group psychotherapy and a manualized computer-based training program. Both interventions will be compared with a treatment as usual (TAU) group, aiming to establish evidence-based psychotherapy approaches for adult individuals with ASD. The primary outcome is evaluated by parents, spouses, or others who have sufficient insight into the respective participant's social communication and interaction, and will be measured with the Social Responsiveness Scale. First, each of both interventions will be compared to TAU. If at least one of the differences is significant, both interventions will be compared against each other. The primary outcome will be measured at baseline (T0) and 4 months after baseline (T1). The trial is the first to validate psychiatric therapeutic and training interventions for adult ASD patients in Germany. A trial is needed because the prevalence of ASD in adulthood without intellectual disability is high, and no evidence-based intervention can be offered in Germany.

This study compared modular cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with enhanced standard community treatment (ESCT) in terms of impact on the severity of autism-related symptoms. Children with ASD (N = 107; aged 6-13 years) were randomly assigned to a treatment condition (CBT or ESCT). Both treatments provided 32 therapy sessions. The CBT condition utilized a modular design, matching specific evidence-based treatment elements to each child's clinical needs (e.g., social-communication symptoms). The ESCT condition provided social skills training and cognitive behavioral training in a structured and linear group therapy format. The primary outcome measure was independent evaluator ratings of peer engagement during school recess using a structured and validated observation system. Parents also made session-by-session ratings on personalized autism-related symptom profiles throughout treatment. CBT outperformed ESCT on the primary outcome measure (p < .001; d = .50; 95% CI [.06, .93]) and the secondary outcome measure (p = .003; d = .87; 95% CI [.45, 1.27]).

33608048,10.1186/S13229-021-00422-0,Modulation of atypical brain activation during executive functioning in autism: a pharmacological MRI study of tianeptine.,2021-02-19,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with deficits in executive functioning (EF), and these have been suggested to contribute to core as well as co-occurring psychiatric symptoms. The biological basis of these deficits is unknown but may include the serotonergic system, which is involved both in regulating EF in neurotypical populations and in the pathophysiology of ASD. We previously demonstrated that reducing serotonin by acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) shifts differences in brain function during performance of EF tasks towards control levels. However, ATD cannot be easily used in the clinic, and we therefore need to adopt alternative approaches to challenge the serotonin system. Hence, we investigated the role of the serotonergic modulator tianeptine on EF networks in ASD. We conducted a pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging study, using a randomized double-blind crossover design, to compare the effect of an acute dosage of 12.5 mg tianeptine and placebo on brain activation during two EF tasks (of response inhibition and sustained attention) in 38 adult males: 19 with ASD and 19 matched controls. Under placebo, compared to controls, individuals with ASD had atypical brain activation in response inhibition regions including the inferior frontal cortex, premotor regions and cerebellum. During sustained attention, individuals with ASD had decreased brain activation in the right middle temporal cortex, right cuneus and left precuneus. Most of the case-control differences in brain function observed under placebo conditions were abolished by tianeptine administration. Also, within ASD individuals, brain functional differences were shifted significantly towards control levels during response inhibition in the inferior frontal and premotor cortices. We conducted a pilot study using a single dose of tianeptine, and therefore, we cannot comment on long-term outcome.

33486138,10.1016/J.Nicl.2021.102557,Volitional modification of brain activity in adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Bayesian analysis of Slow Cortical Potential neurofeedback.,2021-01-01,"Autism spectrum disorder is (ASD) characterized by a persisting triad of impairments of social interaction, language as well as inflexible, stereotyped and ritualistic behaviors. Increasingly, scientific evidence suggests a neurobiological basis of these emotional, social and cognitive deficits in individuals with ASD. The aim of this randomized controlled brain self-regulation intervention study was to investigate whether the core symptomatology of ASD could be reduced via an electroencephalography (EEG) based brain self-regulation training of Slow Cortical Potentials (SCP). 41 male adolescents with ASD were recruited and allocated to a) an experimental group undergoing 24 sessions of EEG-based brain training (n<sub>1</sub> = 21), or to b) an active control group undergoing conventional treatment (n<sub>2</sub> = 20), that is, clinical counseling during a 3-months intervention period. We employed real-time neurofeedback training recorded from a fronto-central electrode intended to enable participants to volitionally regulate their brain activity. Core autistic symptomatology was measured at six time points during the intervention and analyzed with Bayesian multilevel approach to characterize changes in core symptomatology. Additional Bayesian models were formulated to describe the neural dynamics of the training process as indexed by SCP (time-domain) and power density (PSD, frequency-domain) measures. The analysis revealed a substantial improvement in the core symptomatology of ASD in the experimental group (reduction of 21.38 points on the Social Responsiveness Scale, SD = 5.29), which was slightly superior to that observed in the control group (evidence Ratio = 5.79). Changes in SCP manifested themselves as different trajectories depending on the different feedback conditions and tasks. Further, the model of PSD revealed a continuous decrease in delta power, parallel to an increase in alpha power. Most notably, a non-linear (quadratic) model turned out to be better at predicting the data than a linear model across all analyses. Taken together, our analyses suggest that behavioral and neural processes of change related to neurofeedback training are complex and non-linear. Moreover, they have implications for the design of future trials and training protocols.","Konicar L, Radev S, Prillinger K, Klöbl M, Diehm R, Birbaumer N, Lanzenberger R, Plener P L, Poustka L",NeuroImage.

33417375,10.1097/Hrp.0000000000000282,Treatment of Aggression in Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Review.,2021 Jan-Feb 01,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by markedly impaired social interaction, impaired communication, and restricted/repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, and activities. In addition to challenges caused by core symptoms, maladaptive behaviors such as aggression can be associated with ASD and can further disrupt functioning and quality of life. For adults with ASD, these behaviors can portend adverse outcomes (e.g., harm to others or to the individual with ASD, hindering of employment opportunities, criminal justice system involvement). This article reviews the scientific literature to provide an update on evidence-based interventions for aggression in adults with ASD. A search of the electronic databases CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycINFO was conducted using relevant search terms. After reviewing titles, abstracts, full-length articles, and reference lists, 70 articles were identified and reviewed. The strongest (controlled trial) evidence suggests beneficial effects of risperidone, propranolol, fluvoxamine, vigorous aerobic exercise, and dextromethorphan/quinidine for treating aggression in adults with ASD, with lower levels of evidence supporting behavioral interventions, multisensory environments, yokukansan, and other treatments. Additional randomized, controlled trials using consistent methodology that adequately addresses sources of bias are needed to determine which treatments are reliably effective in addressing aggression in adults with ASD. In the meantime, considering efficacy and adverse effect/long-term risk profiles, a practical approach could start with functional assessment-informed behavioral interventions along with encouragement of regular, vigorous aerobic exercise to target aggression in adults with ASD, with pharmacotherapy employed if these interventions are unavailable or inadequate based on symptom acuity.",Im David S,Harvard review of psychiatry,"Adult, Aggression, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Communication, Humans, Quality of Life",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33417375,"From the University of Michigan Hospital, Department of Psychiatry, University of Michigan Medical School."

Recently, noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) methods, namely transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), have been examined as possible new therapeutic options for modifying the pathological neuroplasticity involved in neuropsychiatric disorders including ASD. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review on the therapeutic uses of tDCS and repetitive TMS (rTMS) in ASD patients. A systematic search was performed on Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane and Embase. Original articles reporting the use of tDCS or rTMS to treat ASD were screened and studied by two researchers independently based on PRISMA guidelines. We found 32 eligible studies including 8 tDCS reports, 23 rTMS reports and one report with both tDCS and rTMS. These studies comprised 6 case-reports, 9 non-controlled trials and 17 controlled trials which assessed NIBS effects on the three cognitive, behavioral and biological dimensions in ASD. Existing evidence demonstrates that NIBS methods could be helpful for treating some dimensions of ASD such as repetitive behavior, sociability or some aspects of executive and cognitive functions. However, such evidence should be regarded with care because of the quality of original researches and serious publication bias as well as the heterogeneity of data.

The ACAT group will receive a weekly 100-min session for 6 weeks, regular medical care, and one follow-up session. In this ongoing clinical trial, we will compare the scores of the measures recorded in the pre- and post-intervention stages between the ACAT and TAU groups. A total of 41 patients out of a target of 48 have participated in the trial to date. The primary outcome measure is the Autism Knowledge Questionnaire. Secondary outcome measures include Barriers to Access to Care Evaluation 3rd Edition, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales second edition, the Parenting Resilience Elements Questionnaire, the General Health Questionnaire 12, and the Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children assessments, as well as an electroencephalographic recording. It is expected that participants in the ACAT group will significantly increase their self-understanding and awareness of ASD symptoms compared to those in the TAU group.

32954673,10.1002/Aur.2366,Heterogeneity of Visual Preferences for Biological and Repetitive Movements in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder.,2021-01-01,"Previous studies have repeatedly reported atypical visual preferences to repetitive movements and deficient perception of biological movements in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, limited research has investigated the heterogeneity of the visual preferences in individuals with ASD. In the current study, we explored the visual preferences to different movement types (repetitive, biological, and random) in children with ASD using a paired preferential looking paradigm. Thirty-nine children with ASD and 37 typically developing (TD) children participated in our study, with their eye movements recorded as the index of visual preferences. We examined the differences of visual preferences between the ASD and TD group, and the heterogeneity of visual preferences within the ASD group. We found group differences between children with ASD and TD children: Overall, the ASD group preferred repetitive movements while the TD group preferred biological movements. We also detected heterogeneity of visual preferences within the ASD group: Although the majority of children with ASD preferred repetitive movements as previous studies reported, 9 out of 39 children with ASD preferred biological movements similarly as their TD peers. Moreover, the visual preference patterns were correlated with autistic symptoms, especially the socio-communicative impairments. Our study provided evidence of heterogeneity of visual attention and main visual preference to repetitive movements in children with ASD. The findings add to the body of literature of the heterogeneous behavioral symptoms and the atypical visual preferences in individuals with ASD. LAY SUMMARY: The current study examined visual preferences to biological, repetitive, and random movements in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

Stress associated with teaching is more critical among teachers teaching children with special needs in general and those with autism specifically, partly due to the heterogeneous nature of the disorders. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of Rational Emotive Occupational Health Coaching (REOHC) in minimizing job stress in teachers of children with autism (CWA). A group-randomized waitlist control-trial design was adopted. A sample of 87 teachers of CWA who participated in the study was randomized into the immediate intervention group (IIG) and waitlist group (WLG). Participants were evaluated on 3 occasions: pretest, post-test and follow-up. Three instruments (Occupational Stress Index, Perceived Occupational Stress Scale and Stress Symptom Scale) were used to measure dimensions of job stress. After the pretest exercise, the IIG participated in a 2-hour REOHC programme weekly for a period of 12 weeks. Post- and follow-up evaluations were conducted respectively at 2 weeks and 3 months after the REOHC programme. Those in WLG were exposed to the REOHC after the follow-up assessment. Data collected were analysed using t-test statistics, repeated measures analysis of variance and bar charts. Results revealed that the perceived stress and stress symptoms of the REOHC group reduced significantly over WLG at post-test, and follow-up assessments. Changes in the occupational stress index scores across pre-, post- and follow-up measurements were minimal and could not account for a significant difference between the IIG and WLG. It was concluded that REOHC is effective in reducing subjective feelings and physiological symptoms of job stress, even when the objective stressors remain constant among teachers of CWA and other employees who work in stressful occupational environments.","Ogba Francisca N, Onyishi Charity N, Victor-Aigbodion Vera, Abada Ifeanyichukwu M, Eze Uchenna N, Obiweluozo Patience E, Ugodulunwa Christiana N, Igu Ntasiobi C N, Okorie Cornelius O, Onu JeanFrance C, Eze Angela, Ezeani Emmanuel O, Ebizie Elizabeth N, Onwu Alexandra O",Medicine,"Adult, Autistic Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Child, Child, Preschool, Children with Disabilities, Female, Humans, Male, Occupational Stress, School Teachers, Surveys and Questionnaires",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32898998,"Department of Political Science.; School of General Studies, University of Nigeria Nsukka.; Department of Educational Foundations, University of Nigeria, Nsukka.; Department of Educational Foundations, Alex Ekwueme University, Ndufu-Alike, Ebonyi State Nigeria."
32894253,10.3233/Jrs-200052,Moving past the vaccine/autism controversy - to examine potential vaccine neurological harms.,2021-01-01,"The vaccine/autism controversy has caused vast scientific and public confusion, and it has set back research and education into genuine vaccine-induced neurological disorders. The great strawman of autism has been so emphasized by the vaccine industry that it, and it alone, often appears in authoritative discussions of adverse effects of the MMR and other vaccines. By dismissing the chimerical vaccine/autism controversy, vaccine defenders often dismiss all genuinely neurological aftereffects of the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) and other vaccines, including well-documented events, such as relatively rare cases of encephalopathy and encephalitis. This report explains that autism is not a physical or neurological disorder. It is not caused by injury or disease of the brain. It is a developmental disorder that has no physical origins and no physical symptoms. It is extremely unlikely that vaccines are causing autism; but it is extremely likely that they are causing more neurological damage than currently appreciated, some of it resulting in psychosocial disabilities that can be confused with autism and other psychosocial disorders. This confusion between a developmental, psychosocial disorder and a physical neurological disease has played into the hands of interest groups who want to deny that vaccines have any neurological and associated neuropsychiatric effects. A review of the scientific literature, textbooks, and related media commentary is integrated with basic clinical knowledge. This report shows how scientific sources have used the vaccine/autism controversy to avoid dealing with genuine neurological risks associated with vaccines and summarizes evidence that vaccines, including the MMR, can cause serious neurological disorders. Manufacturers have been allowed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to gain vaccine approval without placebo-controlled clinical trials. The misleading vaccine autism controversy must be set aside in favor of examining actual neurological harms associated with vaccines, including building on existing research that has been ignored. Manufacturers of vaccines must be required to conduct placebo-controlled clinical studies for existing vaccines and for government approval of new vaccines. Many probable or confirmed neurological adverse events occur within a few days or weeks after immunization and could be detected if the trials were sufficiently large. Contrary to current opinion, large, long-term placebo-controlled trials of existing and new vaccines would be relatively easy and safe to conduct.",Breggin Peter R,The International journal of risk & safety in medicine,"Autistic Disorder, Humans, Measles, Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine, Mumps, Rubella",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894253,"Private Practice of Psychiatry, Clinical Psychopharmacology and Forensics, Ithaca, New York, USA."

This paper reports the protocol of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a very early intervention, ENACT (ENvironmental enrichment for infants; parenting with Acceptance and Commitment Therapy), for families of infants at risk of ASD. We aim to recruit 66 mothers of infants at risk of ASD (ie, infants with a sibling or parent diagnosed with ASD) to this RCT. Families will be randomly assigned to care-as-usual or ENACT. ENACT is a very early intervention, leveraging parent-child interactions to improve early social reciprocity, while supporting parental mental health and the parent-child relationship through Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. Intervention content is delivered online (approximately 8 hours) and supported by more than 7 consultations with a clinician. Parents will perform the social reciprocity intervention with their child (30 min per day). Assessments at four time points (baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months corrected age) will assess parent-infant interaction, parental mental health, infant development and early ASD markers.

Their main social deficits include atypical eye contact and difficulty in understanding facial expressions, both of which are associated with an abnormality of the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (rpSTS). It is still undetermined whether it is possible to improve the social function of ALT individuals through noninvasive neural modulation.

The real group showed significant improvement in emotion recognition accuracy after iTBS, but the change was not significantly larger than that in the sham group. Resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) between the rpSTS and the left cerebellum significantly decreased in the real group than the sham group after iTBS.

32406169,10.1111/Papt.12282,A systematic review of the use of acceptance and commitment therapy in supporting parents.,2021-04-01,"Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) has accrued a growing evidence-base for a wide variety of psychological difficulties. Given that ACT promotes broad and flexible repertoires of behaviour as well as neutralizing the ubiquitous psychological processes theorized to be responsible for much human suffering, such an approach may hold promise. The use of ACT-informed parenting interventions offers another alternative to solely behavioural approaches but it remains relatively understudied and in need of further exploration. The current systematic review, which searched four databases, aimed to collate all ACT interventions that included parental therapeutic components in the treatment of various child presenting difficulties. The review also rated the methodological rigour of the ACT evidence-base for this type of treatment format. Twenty-seven individual studies covering a broad spectrum of presenting problems were included, comprising of 1,155 participants. A large proportion of studies were within-group designs with a smaller number using randomized controlled trials. The majority of studies reported improvements on either parent report symptoms regarding child physical or psychological functioning as well as parent-reported measures of stress, depression, and anxiety. Similar improvements were noted on a number of ACT mechanisms of change outcomes, including mindfulness, acceptance, and cognitive fusing. These gains were evident for parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders, chronic pain, and significant physical health difficulties. Maintenance or further treatment gains were often reported at follow-up. These positive findings are tempered by low levels of methodological rigour common in some of the studies included. Despite these limitations, ACT holds promise as a transdiagnostic intervention that can help with the parenting of children with a range of psychological and physical difficulties. ACT has accrued a relatively strong evidence base for a range of psychological difficulties. Despite some methodological shortcomings, ACT shows promise as an intervention to help parents manage stress and difficulties especially in relation to children with autism, chronic pain, and physical health needs. Further research is required in comparing ACT to more established treatments and helping consolidate initial positive findings.","Byrne Gary, Ghráda Áine Ní, O'Mahony Teresa, Brennan Emma",Psychology and psychotherapy,"Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Anxiety, Child, Humans, Parenting",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32406169,"Health Service Executive, Dublin, Ireland.; School of Psychology, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland."

The biological basis of this is poorly understood but may include neurochemically mediated differences in the responsivity of key 'limbic' regions (including amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc)). Emerging evidence also suggests that ASD may be a disorder of brain temporal dynamics. Moreover, serotonin (5-HT) has been shown to be a key regulator of both facial-emotion processing and brain dynamics, and 5-HT abnormalities have been consistently implicated in ASD. To date, however, no one has examined how 5-HT influences the dynamics of facial-emotion processing in ASD. Therefore, we compared the influence of 5-HT on the responsivity of brain dynamics during facial-emotion processing in individuals with and without ASD. Participants completed a facial-emotion processing fMRI task at least 8 days apart using a randomised double-blind crossover design. At each visit they received either a single 20-mg oral dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram or placebo. We found that citalopram (which increases levels of 5-HT) caused sustained activation in key limbic regions during processing of negative facial emotions in adults with ASD-but not in neurotypical adults. The neurotypical adults' limbic response reverted more rapidly to baseline following a 5-HT-challenge. Our results suggest that serotonergic homoeostatic control of the temporal dynamics in limbic regions is altered in adults with ASD, and provide a fresh perspective on the biology of ASD.","Wong Nichol M L, Findon James L, Wichers Robert H, Giampietro Vincent, Stoencheva Vladimira, Murphy Clodagh M, Blainey Sarah, Ecker Christine, Murphy Declan G, McAlonan Grainne M, Daly Eileen",Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,"Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Cross-Over Studies, Emotions, Facial Expression, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Serotonin",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388538,"Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK. nichol.wong@kcl.ac.uk.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; Department of Neuroimaging, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy, Goethe University Frankfurt am Main, Frankfurt, Germany."

Participants included 36 children diagnosed with ASD, 6-17 years of age, who were medically or psychiatrically hospitalized. Children in the intervention group received a brief ABA intervention and were compared to children in the evaluation and monitoring-only group. Families and staff recommended the intervention, children receiving the intervention demonstrated significantly more improvement in unblinded ratings of clinical severity, data from physicians indicated a positive effect of the intervention on levels of staffing and restraints and attending medical providers universally reported satisfaction and benefit of the intervention. Improvements in challenging behaviors were not significantly different as reported by parents, and the length of hospitalization did not differ between the groups. Ultimately, the outcomes of this pilot study suggest incorporating specialized ABA-based assessment and intervention during hospitalization may be feasible and well accepted by clinicians and families. However, future research must address potent methodological challenges related to capturing meaningful data during hospitalizations in order to answer questions of ultimate pragmatic, clinical, and system-level benefits.

LAY SUMMARY: Inpatient hospitalizations for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and severe behavior are common, challenging, and costly in terms of human experience. This study evaluated the benefit of brief applied behavior analysis-based interventions to children and adolescents with ASD displaying challenging behaviors during hospitalizations. Families and staff evaluating the procedures noted perceived potential benefits of the intervention, but this initial pilot study did not document changes in hospitalization length or blinded rating of improvement.","Sanders Kevin, Staubitz John, Juárez A Pablo, Marler Sarah, Browning Whitney, McDonnell Erin, Altstein Lily, Macklin Eric A, Warren Zachary",Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research,"Adolescent, Applied Behavior Analysis, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Hospitalization, Humans, Pilot Projects",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32329237,"Department of Psychiatry and Behavior Sciences, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Biostatistics Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."

However, public debate over the safety of the trivalent MMR vaccine and the resultant drop in vaccination coverage in several countries persists, despite its almost universal use and accepted effectiveness. This is an update of a review published in 2005 and updated in 2012. To assess the effectiveness, safety, and long- and short-term adverse effects associated with the trivalent vaccine, containing measles, rubella, mumps strains (MMR), or concurrent administration of MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine (MMR+V), or tetravalent vaccine containing measles, rubella, mumps, and varicella strains (MMRV), given to children aged up to 15 years. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library 2019, Issue 5), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to 2 May 2019), Embase (1974 to 2 May 2019), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (2 May 2019), and ClinicalTrials.gov (2 May 2019). We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), prospective and retrospective cohort studies (PCS/RCS), case-control studies (CCS), interrupted time-series (ITS) studies, case cross-over (CCO) studies, case-only ecological method (COEM) studies, self-controlled case series (SCCS) studies, person-time cohort (PTC) studies, and case-coverage design/screening methods (CCD/SM) studies, assessing any combined MMR or MMRV / MMR+V vaccine given in any dose, preparation or time schedule compared with no intervention or placebo, on healthy children up to 15 years of age. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. We grouped studies for quantitative analysis according to study design, vaccine type (MMR, MMRV, MMR+V), virus strain, and study settings. Outcomes of interest were cases of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella, and harms. Certainty of evidence of was rated using GRADE. We included 138 studies (23,480,668 participants). Fifty-one studies (10,248,159 children) assessed vaccine effectiveness and 87 studies (13,232,509 children) assessed the association between vaccines and a variety of harms. We included 74 new studies to this 2019 version of the review. Effectiveness Vaccine effectiveness in preventing measles was 95% after one dose (relative risk (RR) 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.13; 7 cohort studies; 12,039 children; moderate certainty evidence) and 96% after two doses (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.28; 5 cohort studies; 21,604 children; moderate certainty evidence). The effectiveness in preventing cases among household contacts or preventing transmission to others the children were in contact with after one dose was 81% (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.89; 3 cohort studies; 151 children; low certainty evidence), after two doses 85% (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.75; 3 cohort studies; 378 children; low certainty evidence), and after three doses was 96% (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.23; 2 cohort studies; 151 children; low certainty evidence). The effectiveness (at least one dose) in preventing measles after exposure (post-exposure prophylaxis) was 74% (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.50; 2 cohort studies; 283 children; low certainty evidence). The effectiveness of Jeryl Lynn containing MMR vaccine in preventing mumps was 72% after one dose (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.76; 6 cohort studies; 9915 children; moderate certainty evidence), 86% after two doses (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.35; 5 cohort studies; 7792 children; moderate certainty evidence). Effectiveness in preventing cases among household contacts was 74% (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.49; 3 cohort studies; 1036 children; moderate certainty evidence). Vaccine effectiveness against rubella is 89% (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.42; 1 cohort study; 1621 children; moderate certainty evidence). Vaccine effectiveness against varicella (any severity) after two doses in children aged 11 to 22 months is 95% in a 10 years follow-up (rate ratio (rr) 0.05, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.08; 1 RCT; 2279 children; high certainty evidence). Safety There is evidence supporting an association between aseptic meningitis and MMR vaccines containing Urabe and Leningrad-Zagreb mumps strains, but no evidence supporting this association for MMR vaccines containing Jeryl Lynn mumps strains (rr 1.30, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.56; low certainty evidence). The analyses provide evidence supporting an association between MMR/MMR+V/MMRV vaccines (Jeryl Lynn strain) and febrile seizures. Febrile seizures normally occur in 2% to 4% of healthy children at least once before the age of 5. The attributable risk febrile seizures vaccine-induced is estimated to be from 1 per 1700 to 1 per 1150 administered doses. The analyses provide evidence supporting an association between MMR vaccination and idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura (ITP). However, the risk of ITP after vaccination is smaller than after natural infection with these viruses. Natural infection of ITP occur in 5 cases per 100,000 (1 case per 20,000) per year. The attributable risk is estimated about 1 case of ITP per 40,000 administered MMR doses. There is no evidence of an association between MMR immunisation and encephalitis or encephalopathy (rate ratio 0.90, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.61; 2 observational studies; 1,071,088 children; low certainty evidence), and autistic spectrum disorders (rate ratio 0.93, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.01; 2 observational studies; 1,194,764 children; moderate certainty). There is insufficient evidence to determine the association between MMR immunisation and inflammatory bowel disease (odds ratio 1.42, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.16; 3 observational studies; 409 cases and 1416 controls; moderate certainty evidence). Additionally, there is no evidence supporting an association between MMR immunisation and cognitive delay, type 1 diabetes, asthma, dermatitis/eczema, hay fever, leukaemia, multiple sclerosis, gait disturbance, and bacterial or viral infections. Existing evidence on the safety and effectiveness of MMR/MMRV vaccines support their use for mass immunisation. Campaigns aimed at global eradication should assess epidemiological and socioeconomic situations of the countries as well as the capacity to achieve high vaccination coverage. More evidence is needed to assess whether the protective effect of MMR/MMRV could wane with time since immunisation.","Di Pietrantonj Carlo, Rivetti Alessandro, Marchione Pasquale, Debalini Maria Grazia, Demicheli Vittorio",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Adolescent, Age Factors, Autistic Disorder, Chickenpox Vaccine, Child, Child, Preschool, Clinical Trials as Topic, Crohn Disease, Epidemiologic Studies, Humans, Infant, Measles, Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine, Mumps, Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Rubella, Seizures, Febrile, Vaccines, Attenuated",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32309885,"Italian Medicine Agency - AIFA, Signal Management Unit, Post-Marketing Surveillance Department, Via del Tritone 181, Rome, Italy, 00187.; SC Farmacia Ospedaliera ASL, Alessandria, Italy.; Azienda Sanitaria Locale ASL AL, Servizio Regionale di Riferimento per l'Epidemiologia, SSEpi-SeREMI, Via Venezia 6, Alessandria, Italy, 15121.; ASL CN2 Alba Bra, Dipartimento di Prevenzione - S.Pre.S.A.L, Via Vida 10, Alba, Piemonte, Italy, 12051."

Growing evidence suggests that cognitive behaviour therapies and mindfulness-based therapies can help autistic individuals learn to manage feelings of anxiety but access to such therapies remains problematic. In the current pilot study, we examined whether existing online cognitive behaviour therapy and mindfulness-based therapy self-help tools can help reduce anxiety in autistic adults. Specifically, 35 autistic adults were asked to try either an existing online cognitive behaviour therapy (n = 16) or mindfulness-based therapy (n = 19) programme while a further 19 autistic adults served as a waitlist comparison group. A first important finding was that 23 of the 35 (66%) participants who tried the online tools completed them, suggesting that such tools are, in principle, acceptable to many autistic adults. In addition, adults in the cognitive behaviour therapy and mindfulness-based therapy conditions reported significant decreases in anxiety over 3 and to some extent also 6 months that were less apparent in the waitlist group of participants. On broader measures of mental health and well-being, the benefits of the online tools were less apparent. Overall, the results suggest that online self-help cognitive behaviour therapy and mindfulness-based therapy tools should be explored further as a means of providing cost-effective mental health support to at least those autistic individuals who can engage effectively with such online tools.","Gaigg Sebastian B, Flaxman Paul E, McLaven Gracie, Shah Ritika, Bowler Dermot M, Meyer Brenda, Roestorf Amanda, Haenschel Corinna, Rodgers Jacqui, South Mikle",Autism : the international journal of research and practice,"Adult, Anxiety, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Cognition, Humans, Mindfulness, Pilot Projects, Quality of Life",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32267168,"University of Westminster, UK.; Newcastle University, UK.; Brigham Young University, USA.; City, University of London, London, UK."

After 4 weeks, parents in the treatment group reported lower levels of challenging behaviors in their children and more frequent use of behavioral interventions than those in the waitlist groups. Furthermore, within-group analyses suggest that these changes persisted up to 12 weeks following completion of the IWT.

Meanwhile, multiple studies document psychological distress within these parents. This pilot longitudinal randomized controlled trial compared the parent-implemented Early Start Denver Model (P-ESDM) to P-ESDM plus mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) for parents. We evaluated changes in parent functioning during active treatment and at follow-up. Participants included children (<36 months old) with autism spectrum disorder and caregivers. Participants were randomly assigned to P-ESDM only (<i>n</i> = 31) or P-ESDM plus MBSR (<i>n</i> = 30). Data were collected at baseline, midtreatment, the end of treatment, and 1, 3, and 6 months posttreatment. Multilevel models with discontinuous slopes were used to test for group differences in outcome changes over time. Both groups improved during active treatment in all subdomains of parent stress (β = -1.42, -1.25, -0.92; <i>P</i> < 0.001), depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms (β = -0.62 and -0.78, respectively; <i>P</i> < 0.05). Parents who received MBSR had greater improvements than those receiving P-ESDM only in parental distress and parent-child dysfunctional interactions (β = -1.91 and -1.38, respectively; <i>P</i> < 0.01). Groups differed in change in mindfulness during treatment (β = 3.15; <i>P</i> < .05), with P-ESDM plus MBSR increasing and P-ESDM declining.

In this population, suicidal behaviour troubles patients, families, and specialists in the field because it is difficult to treat. At present, there is no documented effective therapy for suicidal behaviour in ASD (Autism Research 7:507-521, 2014; Crisis 35:301-309, 2014). Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) is an efficacious treatment programme for chronically suicidal and/or self-harm behaviour in patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (J Psychiatry 166:1365-1374, 2014; Linehan MM. Cognitive behavioural therapy of borderline personality disorder. 1993). This study will evaluate the efficacy of DBT in persons with ASD and suicidal/ self- destructive behaviour in a multicentre randomised controlled clinical trial. One hundred twenty-eight persons with autism and suicidal and/or self-harming behaviour will be recruited from specialised mental healthcare services and randomised into two conditions: 1) the DBT condition in which the participants have weekly individual cognitive behavioural therapy sessions and a 2.5 h skills training group session twice per week during 6 months, and 2) the treatment as usual condition which consists of weekly individual therapy sessions of 30-45 min with a psychotherapist or social worker. Assessments will take place at baseline, at post-treatment (6 months), and after a follow-up period of 12 months. The mediators will also be assessed at 3 months. The primary outcome is the level of suicidal ideation and behaviour. The secondary outcomes are anxiety and social performance, depression, core symptoms of ASD, quality of life, and cost-utility. Emotion regulation and therapeutic alliance are hypothesised to mediate the effects on the primary outcome. The results from this study will provide an evaluation of the efficacy of DBT treatment in persons with ASD on suicidal and self-harming behaviour. The study is conducted in routine mental health services which enhances the generalisability of the study results to clinical practice. ISRCTN96632579. Registered 1 May 2019.

The publication dates ranged from 1 January 2011 to 31 August 2018 or as included in the NICE-children guidelines. Studies were included by an iterative hierarchy: systematic review > randomized-controlled trial > clinically controlled trial. Outcome measures were core ASD symptoms and precursor abilities, or language abilities. The interventions were collated by (1) frequency and (2) approach. The studies focused on low-intensive interventions targeting parental synchrony, the child's initiations, reciprocity, joint attention, play and imitation skills as well as comprehensive interventions. Improvement of core ASD symptoms regarding social communication was observed for low-intensive training of parental synchrony and child's reciprocity as well as for low-intensive comprehensive developmental interventions implementing natural-learning paradigms. High-frequency discrete trial interventions did not improve social communication. Language abilities improved by comprehensive interventions.

However, the neural mechanisms of symptom alleviation, and benefit of MBSR beyond education/support groups are unknown. Maladaptive forms of self-reflection are linked to ASD, depression, and anxiety. In this pilot study, we hypothesized (a) MBSR would reduce depression and anxiety in adults with ASD and (b) a mechanism of symptom alleviation would be increased blood oxygen level-dependent signal in neural self-reflection hubs. Twenty-eight adults were randomly assigned to an 8-week MBSR group (n = 15) or a support group (n = 13) that met for the same amount of time with relaxation education materials. Based on previous self-reflection literature in ASD, regions of interest (ROIs) were middle cingulate cortex (MCC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Only the MBSR group demonstrated significant reductions in depression, and neither group significantly changed in anxiety. Only the MBSR group increased activity of right MCC during self-reflection, and the increase correlated with depression alleviation. There were no changes in vmPFC for the MBSR group or either ROI for the support/education group. Seed-to-voxel connectivity analysis revealed that only the MBSR group increased functional connectivity between right MCC and pre/postcentral gyrus, suggesting MBSR may increase primary sensorimotor input to higher order cognitive brain regions. Taken together, MBSR may be effective for reducing depression in adults with ASD, and the neural mechanism may be increasing frontal circuit involvement during self-directed thought.","Pagni Broc A, Walsh Melissa J M, Foldes Emily, Sebren Ann, Dixon Maria V, Guerithault Nicolas, Braden B Blair",Journal of neuroscience research,"Adolescent, Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Brain, Depressive Disorder, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Mindfulness, Pilot Projects, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32090389,"College of Health Solutions, Arizona State University, Phoenix, AZ, USA."

Evidence is inconclusive regarding the effectiveness of other drug groups. Novel therapeutic agents showed mixed results and quality of evidence is low; some of these agents aim at biologically targeted pharmacotherapy, which may lead to successful individualized treatment options in the future.

31856942,10.3310/Hta23680,Guided self-help for depression in autistic adults: the ADEPT feasibility RCT.,2019-12-01,"Co-occurring depression frequently occurs in autism. Evidence-based psychological interventions have been successfully adapted to treat co-occurring anxiety, but there is little evidence about the usefulness of adapted cognitive-behavioural therapy for depression. To the authors' knowledge, to date there have been no randomised trials investigating the usefulness of low-intensity cognitive-behavioural therapy for depression in autism. The objectives of the study were to (1) develop a low-intensity psychological intervention for depression adapted for autism, (2) assess the feasibility and patient and therapist acceptability of the intervention, (3) estimate the rates of recruitment and retention for a full-scale randomised controlled trial and (4) identify an appropriate measure of depression to be used in a full-scale randomised controlled trial. The study comprised a randomised controlled trial (<i>n</i> = 70) with a nested qualitative evaluation (<i>n</i> = 21). Seventy eligible and consenting participants were randomly allocated to guided self-help or to treatment as usual. Adult autism services in two NHS regions. Adults with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder with depression, that is, a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 items score of ≥ 10. People who had attended more than six sessions of cognitive-behavioural therapy in the previous 6 months were excluded. The low-intensity intervention (guided self-help) comprised materials for nine individual sessions, based on behavioural activation adapted for autism, facilitated by therapist guides (coaches) who were graduate-level psychologists who attended training and regular supervision. Treatment as usual was standard NHS care for depression. Outcomes were measured 10, 16 and 24 weeks post randomisation using self-report and interview measures of depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, social function and quality of life, and a health-care and service use questionnaire. As this was a feasibility study also designed to identify the most appropriate measure of depression, it was not possible to specify the primary outcome measure or outcome point a priori. The aims of the study were met in full. The guided self-help intervention was feasible and well received by participants and coaches. The majority of allocated participants attended the intervention in full. The most practical outcome point was determined to be 16 weeks. There were differential rates of attrition across the treatment groups: 86% of the guided self-help group remained in the study at 24 weeks, compared with 54% of treatment as usual group. The qualitative study suggested that guided self-help had enhanced credibility with participants at the point of randomisation. Inter-rater reliability of the interview measure of depression was less than adequate, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from the prespecified sensitivity to change analyses. The intervention was feasible and well received. Although this feasibility study was not a fully powered trial, it provided some evidence that the guided self-help intervention was effective in reducing depressive symptoms. A full-scale clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness trial of the intervention is warranted. Improvements to the intervention materials as a result of qualitative interviews. Stakeholder consultation to consider future trial design, consider strategies to improve retention in a treatment as usual arm and select a self-report measure of depression to serve as the primary outcome measure.

However, research on the clinical implications of the presence of autistic traits is scarce. This study aimed to investigate the impact of subclinical autistic traits in mentalization-based treatment (MBT) for concurrent borderline personality disorder (BPD) and substance use disorder (SUD). Based on the data of a randomized controlled feasibility study by Philips, Wennberg, Konradsson, and Franck (2018), secondary analyses were conducted. It was tested, if patients' (N = 46) levels of autistic traits were associated with treatment outcome measured in the course of and after treatment using interviews and self-report measures. Participants' autistic traits were not associated with the change in the severity of BPD throughout and at the end of the treatment. However, results showed associations between autistic traits and the change in patients' consumption of alcohol in the course of MBT. Furthermore, there was an association between autistic traits and the change in mentalizing capacity at the end of MBT, indicating that elevated autistic traits were associated with an improvement in mentalizing capacity. Autistic traits on a subclinical level do not appear to be a complicating factor in MBT for concurrent BPD and SUD. On the contrary, in terms of mentalizing capacity autistic traits might be associated with a larger potential for improvement or facilitate treatment outcome. Further research is needed to explore the role of higher autistic traits in treatment of this special patient group.","Kaltenegger Helena C, Philips Björn, Wennberg Peter",Scandinavian journal of psychology,"Adult, Autistic Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, Comorbidity, Feasibility Studies, Female, Humans, Interpersonal Relations, Male, Mentalization, Psychotherapy, Group, Substance-Related Disorders, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31840273,"Department of Psychology, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Public Health Sciences, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden."
31839003,10.1186/S11689-019-9295-8,White matter as a monitoring biomarker for neurodevelopmental disorder intervention studies.,2019-12-16,"Early intervention is a valuable tool to support the development of toddlers with neurodevelopmental disorders. With recent research advances in early identification that allow for pre-symptomatic detection of autism in infancy, scientists are looking forward to intervention during infancy. These advances may be supported by the identification of biologically based treatment and outcome measures that are sensitive and dimensional. The purpose of this review is to evaluate white matter neurodevelopment as a monitoring biomarker for early treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as used as exemplars. White matter has unique neurobiology, including a prolonged period of dynamic development. This developmental pattern may make white matter especially responsive to treatment. White matter develops aberrantly in children with ASD and FXS. Histologic studies in rodents have provided targets for FXS pharmacological intervention. However, pharmaceutical clinical trials in humans failed to garner positive clinical results. In this article, we argue that the use of neurobiological monitoring biomarkers may overcome some of these limitations, as they are objective, not susceptible to placebo effects, and are dimensional in nature. As the field moves towards earlier detection and early intervention for neurodevelopmental disorders, we encourage scientists to consider the advantages of using neurobiological features as monitoring biomarkers.","Swanson Meghan R, Hazlett Heather C",Journal of neurodevelopmental disorders,"Animals, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Biomarkers, Brain, Early Medical Intervention, Fragile X Syndrome, Humans, Neurodevelopmental Disorders, White Matter",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31839003,"Carolina Institute for Developmental Disabilities, Department of Psychiatry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, 27599, NC, USA.; School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences, University of Texas at Dallas, GR41, 800 W.

While social skills group training (SSGT) has shown moderate effects on various sociability outcomes in ASD, there is a need for (1) replication of effects in additional clinical and cultural contexts, (2) designs that employ active control groups, (3) calculation of health economic benefits, (4) identification of the optimal training duration, and (5) measurement of individual goals and quality of life outcomes. With the aim of investigating the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a SSGT, KONTAKT©, a two-armed randomized control trial with adolescents aged 12-17 years (N = 90) with ASD and an intelligence quotient (IQ) of over 70 will be undertaken. Following stratification for centre and gender, participants will be randomly assigned to either KONTAKT© or to an active control group, a group-based cooking programme. Participants will attend both programmes in groups of 6-8 adolescents, over 16 one-and-a-half-hour sessions. The primary outcome examined is adolescent self-rated achievement of personally meaningful social goals as assessed via the Goal Attainment Scaling during an interview with a blinded clinician. Secondary outcomes include adolescent self-reported interpersonal efficacy, quality of life, social anxiety, loneliness, face emotion recognition performance and associated gaze behaviour, and parent proxy reports of autistic traits, quality of life, social functioning, and emotion recognition and expression. Cost-effectiveness will be investigated in relation to direct and indirect societal and healthcare costs. The primary outcomes of this study will be evidenced in the anticipated achievement of adolescents' personally meaningful social goals following participation in KONTAKT© as compared to the active control group. This design will enable rigorous evaluation of the efficacy of KONTAKT©, exercising control over the possibly confounding effect of exposure to a social context of peers with a diagnosis of ASD.

To fully assess treatment efficacy, we examined rates of anxiety symptom change by age groups following either cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or treatment as usual (TAU). One hundred sixty-three children with ASD and ASD-related anxiety symptoms were randomly assigned to either CBT or TAU. Utilizing prediction by correspondence analysis (CA), we evaluated the age effect (defined in three groups; ages 6-9, 10-12, and 13-16) and the changes in correlations between age and anxiety severity levels over the course of treatment. Significantly greater anxiety symptom reduction was associated with CBT compared with TAU across the three age groups. Of particular note, the children ages 10-12 who received CBT showed the greatest improvement compared to all other groups. Late childhood, prior to adolescence, showed the best response to CBT for anxiety in ASD. These findings suggest that treatment programs need to more closely address developmental factors within narrower bands of age groups. The present results are limited in their generalization to the CBT efficacy for a specific age band (ages 10-12). Longitudinal investigations are recommended to confirm whether the similar age group children who receive CBT experience the greatest benefit in reducing their ASD-related anxiety symptoms.","Kim Se-Kang, McKay Dean, Ehrenreich-May Jill, Wood Jeffery, Storch Eric A",Journal of affective disorders,"Adolescent, Anxiety, Anxiety Disorders, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Humans, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31787421,"Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, United States.; University of California, Los Angeles, CA, United States.; University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, United States.; Fordham University, New York City, NY, United States.; Fordham University, New York City, NY, United States.

Psychological therapies are commonly used to treat school-aged youth with ASD; their efficacy has not been established. To compare the relative efficacy of 2 cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) programs and treatment as usual (TAU) to assess treatment outcomes on maladaptive and interfering anxiety in children with ASD. The secondary objectives were to assess treatment outcomes on positive response, ASD symptom severity, and anxiety-associated adaptive functioning. This randomized clinical trial began recruitment in April 2014 at 3 universities in US cities. A volunteer sample of children (7-13 years) with ASD and maladaptive and interfering anxiety was randomized to standard-of-practice CBT, CBT adapted for ASD, or TAU. Independent evaluators were blinded to groupings. Data were collected through January 2017 and analyzed from December 2018 to February 2019. The main features of standard-of-practice CBT were affect recognition, reappraisal, modeling/rehearsal, in vivo exposure tasks, and reinforcement. The CBT intervention adapted for ASD was similar but also addressed social communication and self-regulation challenges with perspective-taking training and behavior-analytic techniques. The primary outcome measure per a priori hypotheses was the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale. Secondary outcomes included treatment response on the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale and checklist measures. Of 214 children initially enrolled, 167 were randomized, 145 completed treatment, and 22 discontinued participation. Those who were not randomized failed to meet eligibility criteria (eg, confirmed ASD). There was no significant difference in discontinuation rates across conditions. Randomized children had a mean (SD) age of 9.9 (1.8) years; 34 were female (20.5%). The CBT program adapted for ASD outperformed standard-of-practice CBT (mean [SD] Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale score, 2.13 [0.91] [95% CI, 1.91-2.36] vs 2.43 [0.70] [95% CI, 2.25-2.62]; P = .04) and TAU (2.93 [0.59] [95% CI, 2.63-3.22]; P < .001).

31748505,10.1038/S41398-019-0654-8,Effects of cannabidivarin (CBDV) on brain excitation and inhibition systems in adults with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD): a single dose trial during magnetic resonance spectroscopy.,2019-11-20,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a high cost neurodevelopmental condition; and there are currently no effective pharmacological treatments for its core symptoms. This has led some families and researchers to trial alternative remedies - including the non-intoxicating Cannabis sativa-derived compound cannabidivarin (CBDV). However, how CBDV affects the human brain is unknown. Previous (pre)clinical evidence suggests that CBDV may modulate brain excitatory-inhibitory systems, which are implicated in ASD. Hence, our main aim was to test, for the first time, if CBDV shifts glutamate and/or GABA metabolites - markers of the brain's primary excitatory and inhibitory system - in both the 'typical' and autistic brain. Our subsidiary aim was to determine whether, within ASD, brain responsivity to CBDV challenge is related to baseline biological phenotype. We tested this using a repeated-measures, double-blind, randomized-order, cross-over design. We used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to compare glutamate (Glx = glutamate + glutamine) and GABA + (GABA + macromolecules) levels following placebo (baseline) and 600 mg CBDV in 34 healthy men with (n = 17) and without (n = 17) ASD. Data acquisition from regions previously reliably linked to ASD (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, DMPFC; left basal ganglia, BG) commenced 2 h (peak plasma levels) after placebo/CBDV administration. Where CBDV significantly shifted metabolite levels, we examined the relationship of this change with baseline metabolite levels. Test sessions were at least 13 days apart to ensure CBDV wash-out. CBDV significantly increased Glx in the BG of both groups. However, this impact was not uniform across individuals. In the ASD group, and not in the typically developing controls, the 'shift' in Glx correlated negatively with baseline Glx concentration. In contrast, CBDV had no significant impact on Glx in the DMPFC, or on GABA+ in either voxel in either group. Our findings suggest that, as measured by MRS, CBDV modulates the glutamate-GABA system in the BG but not in frontal regions. Moreover, there is individual variation in response depending on baseline biochemistry. Future studies should examine the effect of CBDV on behaviour and if the response to an acute dose of CBDV could predict a potential clinical treatment response in ASD.","Pretzsch Charlotte M, Voinescu Bogdan, Lythgoe David, Horder Jamie, Mendez Maria Andreina, Wichers Robert, Ajram Laura, Ivin Glynis, Heasman Martin, Edden Richard A E, Williams Steven, Murphy Declan G M, Daly Eileen, McAlonan Gráinne M",Translational psychiatry,"Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Basal Ganglia, Cannabinoids, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Female, Glutamic Acid, Gray Matter, Humans, Inhibition, Psychological, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Prefrontal Cortex, White Matter, Young Adult, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31748505,"South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust Pharmacy, London, UK.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; Russel H Morgan Department of Radiology and Radiological Science, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK. grainne.mcalonan@kcl.ac.uk.; Department of Neuroimaging Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."

Cognitive behavioral treatment for childhood insomnia (CBT-CI) is efficacious in typically developing children, but not yet tested in school-aged children with autism. This single arm pilot tested 8-session CBT-CI in 17 children with autism and insomnia (M age = 8.76 years, SD = 1.99) and their parent(s) (M age = 39.50 years, SD = 4.83). Treatment integrity was assessed for each session [delivery (by therapist), receipt (participant understanding), and enactment (home practice)]. Children and parents wore actigraphs and completed electronic diaries for 2-weeks to obtain objective and subjective sleep onset latency (SOL), total sleep/wake times (TST/TWT), and sleep efficiency (SE) at pre/post/1-month follow-up. Parents also completed the Aberrant Behavior Checklist [irritability, lethargy, stereotypy, hyperactivity, inappropriate speech (e.g., excessive/repetitive, loud self-talk)] at pre/post/1-month. Fifteen children completed all sessions. Average integrity scores were high [90%-delivery/receipt, 87.5%-enactment]. Parents found CBT-CI helpful, age-appropriate, and autism-friendly. Paired samples t-tests (family-wise error controlled) found CBT-CI improved child sleep (objective SOL-18 min, TWT- 34 min, SE-5%; subjective SOL-29 min, TST-63 min, TWT-45 min, SE-8%), and decreased irritability, lethargy, stereotypy, and hyperactivity. At 1-month, objective TST improved, inappropriate speech decreased, but hyperactivity was no longer decreased. Other gains were maintained. Parent sleep (objective SOL-12 min, TST-35 min, TWT-21 min, SE-4%; subjective SOL-11 min, TWT- 31min, SE-11%) and fatigue also improved. At 1-month, gains were maintained.

It has long been theorized that these youth must learn these skills explicitly, and social skills interventions (SSIs) have followed suit. Recently, performance-based SSIs have emerged, which promote in vivo opportunities for social engagement without explicit instruction. Effects of performance-based SSIs on social knowledge have not been examined. This study employs two discrete samples (one lab-based, one community-based) of youth with ASD to examine the effects of performance-based interventions on social knowledge. Results largely support the efficacy and effectiveness of improving social knowledge by performance-based interventions without explicit teaching. This indicates that youth with ASD may be able to learn these aspects of social cognition implicitly, rather than exclusively explicitly. The results of the current study also suggest that SSI content, dosage, and intensity may relate to these outcomes, which are important considerations in clinical practice and future studies.","Marro Bianca M, Kang Erin, Hauschild Kathryn M, Normansell Karys M, Abu-Ramadan Tamara M, Lerner Matthew D",Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic,"Adolescent, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Female, Humans, Male, Outcome Assessment, Health Care, Psychotherapy, Group, Social Perception, Social Skills, Theory of Mind",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31502873,"Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York."

Currently, no technologies directly target these core social attention difficulties. This study examines the feasibility of automated gaze modification training for improving attention to faces in 3-year-olds with ASD. Using free-viewing data from typically developing (TD) controls (n = 41), we implemented gaze-contingent adaptive cueing to redirect children with ASD toward normative looking patterns during viewing of videos of an actress. Children with ASD were randomly assigned to either (a) an adaptive Cue condition (Cue, n = 16) or (b) a No-Cue condition (No-Cue, n = 19). Performance was examined at baseline, during training, and post-training, and contrasted with TD controls (n = 23). Proportion of time looking at the screen (%Screen) and at actresses' faces (%Face) was analyzed. At Pre-Training, Cue and No-Cue groups did not differ in %Face (P > 0.1). At Post-Training, the Cue group had higher %Face than the No-Cue group (P = 0.015). In the No-Cue group %Face decreased Pre- to Post-Training; no decline was observed in the Cue group. These results suggest gaze-contingent training effectively mitigated decreases of attention toward the face of onscreen social characters in ASD. Additionally, larger training effects were observed in children with lower nonverbal ability, suggesting a gaze-contingent approach may be particularly relevant for children with greater cognitive impairment.

Method A randomized delayed treatment control group design with pre- and postintervention assessments of both parents and children was implemented within a community practice setting. Two follow-up assessments at 3 and 6 months postintervention were also completed. Results Overall, results indicate that the intervention is efficacious in teaching social communication and self-regulation concept knowledge to children with ASD and their parents. Both parents and children demonstrated an increase in social communication and self-regulation knowledge after participating in the Growing, Learning, and Living With Autism Group as compared to a delayed treatment control group. The effects of the intervention did not extend to parent-child interactions coded from video recordings. Child treatment effects were maintained at the 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments. Conclusions Preliminary efficacy of the Growing, Learning, and Living With Autism Group was established. Based on parent report at the conclusion of the intervention, this is a socially valid intervention for teaching social communication and self-regulation skills to school-age children with ASD.

SSGT has shown modest and heterogeneous effects. One of the major genetic risk factors in ASD is rare copy number variation (CNV). However, limited information exists whether CNV profiles could be used to aid intervention decisions. Here, we analyzed the rare genic CNV carrier status for 207 children, of which 105 received SSGT and 102 standard care as part of a randomized clinical trial for SSGT. We found that being a carrier of rare genic CNV did not have an impact on the SSGT outcome measured by the parent-report Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS). However, when stratifying by pathogenicity and size of the CNVs, we identified that carriers of clinically significant and large genic CNVs (>500 kb) showed inferior SRS outcomes at post-intervention (P = 0.047 and P = 0.036, respectively) and follow-up (P = 0.008 and P = 0.072, respectively) when adjusting for standard care effects. Our study provides preliminary evidence that carriers of clinically significant and large genic CNVs might not benefit as much from SSGT as non-carriers.

So far, scientific publications regarding medical clowning focus on general health advantages. The current study is the first controlled research examining the use of medical clowning in the therapy for children with ASD. Twenty-four children aged 2-6 years old with ASD enrolled in our special education intensive program were examined before and after group sessions with clown intervention (CI) and other intervention (OI). We tested stereotypic behaviors, verbal expression, play reciprocity, and social smiles. Data was collected during 12 weeks of intervention, and the trajectory of change was evaluated in addition to the pre-/post-intervention.Conclusion: improvement over time in all measures: Significant increase in word production, play reciprocity, and amount of social smiles during CI as compared with OI. We also found a reduction in frequency of stereotypic behaviors during and following CI as compared with before CI. These preliminary results indicate that medical clowning may be beneficial for young children with ASD, since it promotes communication and social reciprocity in a fun and lively interventional setting. What is Known: • Many therapies are used and proven as efficacious interventions for children with ASD. • So far, medical clowning was not tested as an intervention or therapy for ASD. What is New: • Medical clowning sessions with children with ASD elicited enhanced communication during the interventions as compared with other interventions. • Medical clowning sessions contributed to a decrease in frequency of stereotypic movements over time, in children with ASD.","Shefer Shahar, Leon Attia Odelia, Rosenan Ruth, Wald Ori A, Ende Hamutal, Gabis Lidia V",European journal of pediatrics,"Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Child Behavior, Child, Preschool, Female, Humans, Laughter Therapy, Male, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Psychotherapy, Group, Social Behavior, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31243575,"Weinberg Child Development Center, The Chaim Sheba Medical Center, 5262000, Tel HaShomer Ramat Gan, Israel.; Weinberg Child Development Center, The Chaim Sheba Medical Center, 5262000, Tel HaShomer Ramat Gan, Israel.

The children, aged 2 to 6 years old, were suspected to have autism spectrum disorder (ASD) based on Pervasive Developmental Disorders Autism Society Japan Rating Scale (PARS) scores of 9 points or more. The investigation randomly assigned them to two groups-""the intervention group"" and ""the control group""-and carried out SSTP. The intervention group answered the questionnaire before and after intervention, three months later. The control group also answered the questionnaire 2 months before the intervention, before and after intervention. Thus, each group answered three times. The questionnaire used the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), a Parenting Style scale (PS), the Relationship Quality Index (RQI), and the Japanese version of a Maltreatment scale (JM). For effectiveness of the intervention before and after, an analysis of covariance was carried out on the scores from the first and second questionnaires in the intervention and control groups. For effectiveness 3 months after the intervention, a repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed on the scale scores from the first to the third questionnaire in the intervention group.Results　The average age of the children was 3.7±1.4 years old, and the average PARS score was 20±6.8. They were suspected to have ASD. The average SDQ score was 76.1±18.8, and their intelligence was borderline. A significant difference was seen before and after the intervention in SDQ (the issue of action, the total of the difficulty), PS (overreaction, gab, general score), and JM scores; no significant difference was seen in RQI scores. Three months after the intervention, a lasting effect was seen in SDQ (the issue of action, the total of the difficulty, hyperkinetic) and PS (all items) scores in the intervention group.Conclusions　Receiving SSTP caused a positive change in the mothers' parenting and improved the problem behavior of the children.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) studies targeting the mPFC indicate that it may be a useful therapeutic resource in psychiatry due to its selective modulation of this area and connected regions. This review examines six mPFC rTMS trials selected from 697 initial search results. We discuss the main results, technical and methodological details, safety, tolerability, and localization strategies. Six different protocols were identified, including inhibitory (1 Hz) and excitatory (5, 10, and 20 Hz) frequencies applied therapeutically to patient populations diagnosed with major depressive disorder, OCD, autistic spectrum disorder, SUD, specific phobia, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In the OCD and acrophobia trials, rTMS significantly reduced symptoms compared to placebo.

Specific areas of the brain that are involved in sensorimotor integration, such as the cerebellum and basal ganglia, are pathologically different in individuals with ASC in comparison to typically developing (TD) peers. These brain regions contain GABAergic inhibitory neurons that release an inhibitory neurotransmitter, γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA). Brain GABA levels are decreased in ASC. This study explored the effect of introducing a non-invasive GABA substitute, in the form of GABA Oolong tea, on sensorimotor skills, ASC profiles, anxieties and sleep of children with ASC. <b>Methods:</b> Nine children took part: (5 male, 4 female). Each child participated in three tea conditions: high GABA, high L-Theanine (a compound that increases GABA), placebo with low GABA. A double-blind, repeated measures design was employed. Measures were taken after each tea condition. Sensory and ASC profiles were scored using parental questionnaires. Motor skills were assessed using a gold standard coordination assessment. Sleep was monitored using an actiwatch and anxiety measured through cortisol assays. Subjective views were sought from parents on 'best' tea. <b>Results:</b> The results showed significant improvement in manual dexterity and some large individual improvements in balance, sensory responsivity, DSM-5 criteria and cortisol levels with GABA tea. Improvements were also seen in the L-Theanine condition although they were more sporadic. <b>Conclusions:</b> These results suggest that sensorimotor abilities, anxiety levels and DSM-5 symptomology of children with ASC can benefit from the administration of GABA in the form of Oolong tea.","Hannant Penelope, Cassidy Sarah, Renshaw Derek, Joyce Anna",Nutritional neuroscience,"Adolescent, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Double-Blind Method, Feasibility Studies, Female, Glutamates, Humans, Male, Motor Skills, Neuropsychological Tests, Tea, Treatment Outcome, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31060476,"Centre for Innovative Research Across the Life Course, Coventry University, Coventry, UK.; Centre for Applied Biological & Exercise Sciences, Coventry University, Coventry, UK.; School of Psychology, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK."

One important resource in managing these heightened levels of negative affect is emotion regulation, which in turn depends upon the ability to recognize and understand one's own and others' mental states (referred to as mentalization or reflective functioning). In this study, parents of children with ASD either participated in a mentalization-based group intervention (N = 36) or a delayed treatment (N = 28). Compared to delayed treatment participants, parents in the mentalization-based group had increases in reflective functioning and in the belief that emotions can change. Moreover, they reported decreased behavioral and emotional symptoms in their children, and greater parental self-efficacy. These preliminary findings support previous studies, which have shown that mentalization-based interventions for parents lead to positive outcomes, and suggest that these findings may apply to a diverse population of parents such as those of children with broader autism phenotype or children with different neurological disorders.

While mobile technology-based therapy can alleviate wait-lists and scale for increasing demand, few clinical trials exist to support its use for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) care. To evaluate the efficacy of Superpower Glass, an artificial intelligence-driven wearable behavioral intervention for improving social outcomes of children with ASD. A randomized clinical trial in which participants received the Superpower Glass intervention plus standard of care applied behavioral analysis therapy and control participants received only applied behavioral analysis therapy. Assessments were completed at the Stanford University Medical School, and enrolled participants used the Superpower Glass intervention in their homes. Children aged 6 to 12 years with a formal ASD diagnosis who were currently receiving applied behavioral analysis therapy were included. Families were recruited between June 2016 and December 2017. The first participant was enrolled on November 1, 2016, and the last appointment was completed on April 11, 2018. Data analysis was conducted between April and October 2018. The Superpower Glass intervention, deployed via Google Glass (worn by the child) and a smartphone app, promotes facial engagement and emotion recognition by detecting facial expressions and providing reinforcing social cues. Families were asked to conduct 20-minute sessions at home 4 times per week for 6 weeks. Four socialization measures were assessed using an intention-to-treat analysis with a Bonferroni test correction. Overall, 71 children (63 boys [89%]; mean [SD] age, 8.38 [2.46] years) diagnosed with ASD were enrolled (40 [56.3%] were randomized to treatment, and 31 (43.7%) were randomized to control). Children receiving the intervention showed significant improvements on the Vineland Adaptive Behaviors Scale socialization subscale compared with treatment as usual controls (mean [SD] treatment impact, 4.58 [1.62]; P = .005). Positive mean treatment effects were also found for the other 3 primary measures but not to a significance threshold of P = .0125. The observed 4.58-point average gain on the Vineland Adaptive Behaviors Scale socialization subscale is comparable with gains observed with standard of care therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized clinical trial to demonstrate efficacy of a wearable digital intervention to improve social behavior of children with ASD. The intervention reinforces facial engagement and emotion recognition, suggesting either or both could be a mechanism of action driving the observed improvement.

30891960,10.1002/Aur.2093,The Use of Eye Tracking as a Biomarker of Treatment Outcome in a Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial for Young Children with Autism.,2019-05-01,"There is a pressing need for objective, quantifiable outcome measures in intervention trials for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The current study investigated the use of eye tracking as a biomarker of treatment response in the context of a pilot randomized clinical trial of treatment for young children with ASD. Participants included 28 children with ASD, aged 18-48 months, who were randomized to one of two conditions: Pivotal Response Intervention for Social Motivation (PRISM) or community treatment as usual (TAU). Eye-tracking and behavioral assessment of developmental functioning were administered at Time 1 (prior to randomization) and at Time 2 (after 6 months of intervention). Two well-established eye-tracking paradigms were used to measure social attention: social preference and face scanning. As a context for understanding relationships between social attention and developmental ability, we first examined how scanning patterns at Time 1 were associated with concurrent developmental functioning and compared to those of 23 age-matched typically developing (TD) children. Changes in scanning patterns from Time 1 to Time 2 were then compared between PRISM and TAU groups and associated with behavioral change over time. Results showed that the social preference paradigm differentiated children with ASD from TD children. In addition, attention during face scanning was associated with language and adaptive communication skills at Time 1 and change in language skills from Time 1 to Time 2. These findings highlight the importance of examining targeted biomarkers that measure unique aspects of child functioning and that are well-matched to proposed mechanisms of change. Autism Research 2019, 12: 779-793. © 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Biomarkers have the potential to provide important information about how and why early interventions effect positive change for young children with ASD. The current study suggests that eye-tracking measures of social attention can be used to track change in specific areas of development, such as language, and points to the need for targeted eye-tracking paradigms designed to measure specific behavioral changes. Such biomarkers could inform the development of optimal, individualized, and adaptive interventions for young children with ASD.","Bradshaw Jessica, Shic Frederick, Holden Anahita N, Horowitz Erin J, Barrett Amy C, German Tamsin C, Vernon Ty W",Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research,"Attention, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Biomarkers, Child, Preschool, Early Intervention, Educational, Eye Movements, Female, Humans, Infant, Male, Motivation, Pilot Projects, Social Behavior, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30891960,"Department of Psychology, University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina.; Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, University of California Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California.; Department of Counseling, Clinical, and School Psychology, University of California Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California.; Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development, Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, Washington."

Pivotal response treatment (PRT) is an effective intervention for targeting these skills; however, similar to other behavioral interventions, response to PRT is variable across individuals. Thus, objective markers capable of predicting treatment response are critically-needed to identify which children are most likely to benefit from this intervention. In this pilot study, we investigated whether structural neuroimaging measures from language regions in the brain are associated with response to PRT. Children with ASD (n = 18) who were receiving PRT to target their language deficits were assessed with MRI at baseline. T1-weighted images were segmented with FreeSurfer and morphometric measures of the primary language regions (inferior frontal (IFG) and superior temporal (STG) gyri) were evaluated. Children with ASD and language deficits did not exhibit the anticipated relationships between baseline structural measures of language regions and baseline language abilities, as assessed by the number of utterances displayed during a structured laboratory observation (SLO). Interestingly, the level of improvement on the SLO was correlated with baseline asymmetry of the IFG, and the size of the left STG at baseline was correlated with the level of improvement on standardized parental questionnaires. Although very preliminary, the observed associations between baseline structural properties of language regions and improvement in language abilities following PRT suggest that neuroimaging measures may be able to help identify which children are most likely to benefit from specific language treatments, which could help improve precision medicine for children with ASD.","Hegarty John P, Gengoux Grace W, Berquist Kari L, Millán M Estefanía, Tamura Serena M, Karve Shweta, Rosenthal Margaret D, Phillips Jennifer M, Hardan Antonio Y",Journal of psychiatric research,"Autism Spectrum Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Child, Child, Preschool, Female, Humans, Language Disorders, Language Therapy, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Neuroimaging, Outcome Assessment, Health Care, Pilot Projects, Prefrontal Cortex, Temporal Lobe",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30771619,"Department of Human Biology, Stanford University, 450 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.

We included all children (N = 1 579 263) born in Sweden 1992-2007. A nested case-control design was used to compare 22 894 ASD cases identified from the National Patient Register to (a) 228 940 age-, county- and sex-matched controls randomly selected from the population, (b) their eligible full-siblings (n = 1267), (c) half-siblings (n = 1323), (d) full-cousins (n = 11 477) and (e) half-cousins (n = 3337). Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for ASD in children differentially exposed to parental asthma or prenatal asthma medications. Maternal asthma was associated with increased risk of offspring ASD (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.38-1.49); there was a weaker association for paternal asthma (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.11-1.23).

Although repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has been studied for neurodevelopmental disorders, there is no clear consensus on its therapeutic effects. This systematic review examined literature on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for children and adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders published up to 2018 using the PubMed database. The search identified 264 articles and 14 articles met eligibility criteria. Twelve of these studies used conventional repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and two studies used theta burst stimulation. No severe adverse effects were reported in these studies. In patients with autism spectrum disorder, low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and intermittent theta burst stimulation applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may have therapeutic effects on social functioning and repetitive behaviors. In patients with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation applied to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may target inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. In patients with tic disorders, low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation applied to the bilateral supplementary motor area improved tic symptom severity.

A reduction of P100 amplitude in the right hemisphere and a trend toward reduced N200 latency in the biological motion task were found after the training only in the intervention group, whereas behavioral performance remained stable. Change in N200 latencies and parent-rated social responsiveness showed small but statistically nonsignificant correlations. No changes were observed regarding FER. Results indicate that the intervention changed neural correlates of social perception in ASD. Especially neural correlates of biological motion perception, which is an important prerequisite for successful social interaction, were sensitive to change. ERPs of social perception tasks that are impaired in ASD can well be used to objectively measure neural processing improvement by behavioral intervention.

LAY SUMMARY: It is well known that people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) process social information differently than other people and that these differences can also be seen in their brain activity. We also know that behavioral therapies, such as group-based social skills trainings can help people with ASD improve their behavior. But it is unclear how therapy changes social processing in the brain. The aim of our study was therefore to examine how neural processing of social stimuli changed after behavioral intervention. Comparing a group of children and adolescents that received the group-based social skills training SOSTA-FRA to a control group we found that the neural processing of human motion became faster and involved less brain resources after the intervention, while behavioral performance remained stable. No changes were seen for the processing of emotional facial expressions. We recommend that future studies should also analyze changes in brain function as well as behavioral changes as a secondary therapy outcome parameter.","Luckhardt Christina, Kröger Anne, Elsuni Leyla, Cholemkery Hannah, Bender Stephan, Freitag Christine M",Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research,"Adolescent, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Child, Evoked Potentials, Facial Recognition, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Motion Perception, Parents, Social Perception, Social Skills",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30324710,"Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy, Autism Research and Intervention Center of Excellence, University Hospital Frankfurt, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany."

Cervical total disc replacement (TDR) could reduce the stress of adjacent segments and retard ASD in theory, but the superiority has not been determined yet. This analysis aimed that whether TDR was superior to ACDF for decreasing adjacent segment degeneration (ASDeg) and adjacent segment disease (ASDis). A meta-analysis was performed according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Collaboration with PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and CBM (China Biological Medicine) databases. It included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that reported ASDeg, ASDis, and reoperation on adjacent segments after TDR and ACDF. Two investigators independently selected trials, assessed methodological quality, and evaluated the quality of this meta-analysis using the grades of recommendation, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) approach. Eleven studies with 2632 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The overall rate of ASD in TDR group was lower than ACDF group (OR = 0.6; 95% CI [0.38, 0.73]; P < 0.00001). Both the incidence of ASDeg and the reoperation rate were statistically lower in the TDR group than in the ACDF group (OR = 0.58, P < 0.00001; OR = 0.52, P = 0.01, respectively). Subgroup analysis was performed according to the follow-up time and trial site; the rate of ASDeg was lower in patients underwent TDR no matter the follow-up time, and TDR tended to increase the superiority across time. The rate of ASDeg was also lower with TDR both in the USA and China (P < 0.0001, P = 0.03, respectively). But the cost-effectiveness result might be prone to neither of the two surgery approaches. According to GRADE, the overall quality of this meta-analysis was moderate. TDR decreased the rates of ASDeg and reoperation compared with that of ACDF, and the superiority may become more apparent over time. We cautiously and slightly suggest adopting TDR according to the GRADE but may not believe it excessively.","Xu Shuai, Liang Yan, Zhu Zhenqi, Qian Yalong, Liu Haiying",Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,"Cervical Vertebrae, Diskectomy, Humans, Intervertebral Disc Degeneration, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Reoperation, Spinal Fusion, Total Disc Replacement, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30285807,"Department of Spinal Surgery, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University, No. 11 Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, People's Republic of China. 393805151@qq.com.; Department of Spinal Surgery, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University, No. 11 Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, People's Republic of China."

Currently, there is no US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for these core symptoms. This article reviews the biological origins of the social function deficit associated with autism spectrum disorder and the drug therapies with the potential to treat this deficit. A review of the history of autism demonstrates that a deficit in social interaction has been the defining feature of the concept of autism from its conception. Abnormalities identified in early social skill development and an overview of the pathophysiology abnormalities associated with autism spectrum disorder are discussed as are the abnormalities in brain circuits associated with the social function deficit. Previous and ongoing clinical trials examining agents that have the potential to improve social deficits associated with autism spectrum disorder are discussed in detail. This discussion reveals that agents such as oxytocin and propranolol are particularly promising and undergoing active investigation, while other agents such as vasopressin agonists and antagonists are being activity investigated but have limited published evidence at this time. In addition, agents such as bumetanide and manipulation of the enteric microbiome using microbiota transfer therapy appear to have promising effects on core autism spectrum disorder symptoms including social function.

Trauma-related diagnoses such as acute stress disorder (ASD) or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may exacerbate suicide risk, particularly among service members psychiatrically hospitalized following suicide-related events. To date, treatments to address suicide risk and trauma symptomatology among service members within inpatient milieus have been nonexistent. To address this gap, a randomized controlled pilot trial of Post-Admission Cognitive Therapy (PACT) was conducted to evaluate a targeted cognitive-behavioral program among traumatized military personnel (N = 36) hospitalized following a recent suicide attempt. All participants met criteria for ASD or PTSD and were randomly assigned to receive either PACT and enhanced usual care (PACT + EUC) or EUC alone. PACT consisted of six 60- to 90-min individual psychotherapy sessions, adapted from Brown et al.'s (2005) cognitive therapy protocol for suicide prevention. Blinded follow-up assessments were conducted at 1-, 2-, and 3-months postpsychiatric discharge. The primary outcome was days until repeat suicide attempt. Secondary outcomes included depression, hopelessness, suicide ideation, and PTSD symptoms. Participants did not significantly differ in reattempt status. However, based on reliable change index analyses, a greater proportion of PACT + EUC versus EUC participants met criteria for clinically significant change on measures of depression (100% vs. 78%), hopelessness (83% vs. 57%), and PTSD symptom severity (100% vs. 38%), but not for suicide ideation (60% vs. 67%).

While there are no specific pharmacological or other physical treatments for autism, in recent years repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), a technique for non-invasive neuromodulation, has attracted interest due to potential therapeutic value. Here we report the results of a systematic literature review and meta-analysis on the use of rTMS to treat ASD. <b>Methods:</b> We performed a systematic literature search on PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, Bielefeld Academic Search, and Educational Resources Information Clearinghouse. Search terms reflected diagnoses and treatment modalities of interest. Studies reporting use of rTMS to treat core ASD or cognitive symptoms in ASD were eligible. Two researchers performed article selection and data extraction independently, according to PRISMA guidelines. Changes in ASD clinical scores or in cognitive performance were the main outcomes. Random effects meta-analysis models were performed. <b>Results:</b> We found 23 eligible reports, comprising 4 case-reports, 7 non-controlled clinical trials, and 12 controlled clinical trials, comparing the effects of real TMS with waiting-list controls (<i>n</i> = 6) or sham-treatment (<i>n</i> = 6). Meta-analyses showed a significant, but moderate, effect on repetitive and stereotyped behaviors, social behavior, and number of errors in executive function tasks, but not other outcomes. Most studies had a moderate to high risk of bias, mostly due to lack of subject- and evaluator-blinding to treatment allocation. Only 5 studies reported stability of these gains for periods of up 6 months, with descriptions that improvements were sustained over time. <b>Conclusions:</b> Existing evidence supports that TMS could be useful to treat some dimensions of ASD. However, such evidence must be regarded with care, as most studies did not adequately control for placebo effects. Moreover, little is known regarding the most effective stimulation parameters, targets, and schedules. There is an urgent need for further randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trials, with adequate follow-up periods, to test the efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation to treat these disorders. Available evidence must be regarded as preliminary and insufficient, at present, to support offering TMS to treat ASD.","Barahona-Corrêa J Bernardo, Velosa Ana, Chainho Ana, Lopes Ricardo, Oliveira-Maia Albino J",Frontiers in integrative neuroscience,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30038561,"CADIN-Neurodesenvolvimento e Inclusão, Cascais, Portugal.; Champalimaud Clinical Centre, Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown, Lisbon, Portugal.; Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health, Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Ocidental, Lisbon, Portugal.; Centro de Investigação e de Intervenção Social (CIS-IUL), Instituto Universitário de Lisboa (ISCTE-IUL), Lisbon, Portugal."

29911878,10.1037/Spq0000261,Influence of homogeneity of student characteristics in a group-based social competence intervention.,2019-01-01,"Although some literature reviews cited mixed results for group-based social competence interventions in schools, existing descriptions of intervention efficacy often lack attention on important factors that may moderate differential response. Some studies suggest that individual characteristics such as diagnosis (i.e., specific deficit clusters) or behavioral profiles may be important social outcome moderators. Given the interactive nature of group-based interventions, understanding how individual characteristics combine to influence outcomes for the group as a whole is an important next step. By using a multisite cluster randomized control trial (n = 274), the current study explores the impact that varying student characteristics have on outcomes of the Social Competence Intervention for Adolescents (SCI-A; Stichter, Herzog, Owens, & Malugen, 2016; Stichter et al., 2010) compared to outcomes of business-as-usual (BAU) practices. Researchers hypothesized that (a) SCI-A would be more effective than BAU in improving ratings of students' social functioning when students within groups were more similar to each other on relevant diagnostic and behavioral indicators, and (b) that within SCI-A only, more versus less homogenous groups would demonstrate greater social outcome gains. Results offer some support for these hypotheses: SCI-A was more effective in improving social communication and motivation when groups were diagnostically similar (ds > 0.55). Considering changes in social awareness and communication, SCI-A was more effective when groups were heterogeneous on socially competent behavior (ds > 1.32) and less effective when groups were heterogeneous on antisocial behavior (ds > 1.00). The authors discuss the implications and importance of research exploring factors such as group composition that may moderate intervention response in applied settings.

Previous studies indicate small to moderate effects on social communication capacities. The duration of most available programs is relatively short, and extended training might lead to further improvement. This randomized controlled trial compared an extended 24-week version of the SSGT program KONTAKT with standard care. The weekly sessions gradually shifted in content from acquisition of new skills to real-world application of the acquired skills. A total of 50 participants with ASD (15 females; 35 males) aged 8-17 years were included. The study was conducted at two child and adolescent psychiatry outpatient units in Sweden. The primary outcome was the Social Responsiveness Scale-Second Edition (SRS-2) rated by parents and blinded teachers. Secondary outcomes included parent- and teacher-rated adaptive behaviors, trainer-rated global functioning and clinical severity, and self-reported child and caregiver stress. Assessments were made at baseline, posttreatment, and at 3-months follow-up. Parent-rated SRS-2 scores indicated large effects posttreatment [- 19.2; 95% CI - 29.9 to - 8.5; p < .001, effect size (ES) = 0.76], which were maintained at follow-up (- 20.7; 95% CI - 31.7 to - 9.7; p < .0001, ES = 0.82).

At present, there are no curative or psychopharmacological therapies to effectively treat all symptoms of the disorders. Early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) is a treatment based on the principles of applied behavior analysis. Delivered for multiple years at an intensity of 20 to 40 hours per week, it is one of the more well-established treatments for ASD. This is an update of a Cochrane review last published in 2012. To systematically review the evidence for the effectiveness of EIBI in increasing functional behaviors and skills, decreasing autism severity, and improving intelligence and communication skills for young children with ASD. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, 12 additional electronic databases and two trials registers in August 2017. We also checked references and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. Randomized control trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) in which EIBI was compared to a no-treatment or treatment-as-usual control condition. Participants must have been less than six years of age at treatment onset and assigned to their study condition prior to commencing treatment. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.We synthesized the results of the five studies using a random-effects model of meta-analysis, with a mean difference (MD) effect size for outcomes assessed on identical scales, and a standardized mean difference (SMD) effect size (Hedges' g) with small sample correction for outcomes measured on different scales. We rated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We included five studies (one RCT and four CCTs) with a total of 219 children: 116 children in the EIBI groups and 103 children in the generic, special education services groups. The age of the children ranged between 30.2 months and 42.5 months. Three of the five studies were conducted in the USA and two in the UK, with a treatment duration of 24 months to 36 months. All studies used a treatment-as-usual comparison group.Primary outcomesThere is low quality-evidence at post-treatment that EIBI improves adaptive behaviour (MD 9.58 (assessed using Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS) Composite; normative mean = 100, normative SD = 15), 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.57 to 13.60, P < 0.0001; 5 studies, 202 participants), and reduces autism symptom severity (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.79 to 0.11, P = 0.14; 2 studies, 81 participants; lower values indicate positive effects) compared to treatment as usual.No adverse effects were reported across studies.Secondary outcomesThere is low-quality evidence at post-treatment that EIBI improves IQ (MD 15.44 (assessed using standardized IQ tests; scale 0 to 100, normative SD = 15), 95% CI 9.29 to 21.59, P < 0.001; 5 studies, 202 participants); expressive (SMD 0.51, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.90, P = 0.01; 4 studies, 165 participants) and receptive (SMD 0.55, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.87, P = 0.001; 4 studies, 164 participants) language skills; and problem behaviour (SMD -0.58, 95% CI -1.24 to 0.07, P = 0.08; 2 studies, 67 participants) compared to treatment as usual. There is weak evidence that EIBI may be an effective behavioral treatment for some children with ASD; the strength of the evidence in this review is limited because it mostly comes from small studies that are not of the optimum design. Due to the inclusion of non-randomized studies, there is a high risk of bias and we rated the overall quality of evidence as 'low' or 'very low' using the GRADE system, meaning further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.It is important that providers of EIBI are aware of the current evidence and use clinical decision-making guidelines, such as seeking the family's input and drawing upon prior clinical experience, when making recommendations to clients on the use EIBI. Additional studies using rigorous research designs are needed to make stronger conclusions about the effects of EIBI for children with ASD.","Reichow Brian, Hume Kara, Barton Erin E, Boyd Brian A",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Behavior Therapy, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Child, Preschool, Communication, Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic, Early Intervention, Educational, Early Medical Intervention, Humans, Intelligence",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29742275,"Anita Zucker Center for Excellence in Early Childhood Studies, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA."

However, the underlying neurophysiology is unknown. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation, we assessed cortical excitability, long-term depression (LTD)-like neuroplasticity in 45 GDM-exposed and 12 control children aged 11-13 years. Data were analysed against salivary cortisol and maternal diabetes severity and treatment (insulin [N = 22] or metformin [N = 23]) during pregnancy. GDM-exposed children had reduced cortical excitability (p = .003), LTD-like neuroplasticity (p = .005), and salivary cortisol (p < .001) when compared with control children. Higher maternal insulin resistance (IR) before and during GDM treatment was associated with a blunted neuroplastic response in children (p = .014) and this was not accounted for by maternal BMI. Additional maternal and neonatal measures, including fasting plasma glucose and inflammatory markers, predicted neurophysiological outcomes. The metformin and insulin treatment groups had similar outcomes. These results suggest that GDM can contribute to subtle differences in child neurophysiology, and possibly cortisol secretion, persisting into early adolescence. Importantly, these effects appear to occur during second trimester, before pharmacologic treatment typically commences, and can be predicted by maternal insulin resistance. Therefore, earlier detection and treatment of GDM may be warranted. Metformin appears to be safe for these aspects of neurodevelopment.","Van Dam Jago M, Garrett Amy J, Schneider Luke A, Hodyl Nicolette A, Goldsworthy Mitchell R, Coat Suzette, Rowan Janet A, Hague William M, Pitcher Julia B",EBioMedicine,"Adolescent, Autistic Disorder, Cerebral Cortex, Child, Diabetes, Gestational, Female, Humans, Hydrocortisone, Male, Neurodevelopmental Disorders, Neuronal Plasticity, Pregnancy, Saliva, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29709497,"Robinson Research Institute, Adelaide Medical School, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia 5006, Australia.; Robinson Research Institute, Adelaide Medical School, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia 5006, Australia.

Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is considered an efficacious treatment for anxiety in children with ASD. Additional research is needed to examine the efficacy of a transdiagnostic treatment approach, whereby the same treatment can be applied to multiple emotional problems, beyond solely anxiety. The purpose of the present study was to examine the efficacy of a manualized and individually delivered 10-session, transdiagnostic CBT intervention, aimed at improving emotion regulation and mental health difficulties in children with ASD. Sixty-eight children (M age = 9.75, SD = 1.27) and their parents participated in the study, randomly allocated to either a treatment immediate (n = 35) or waitlist control condition (n = 33) (ISRCTN #67079741).

Beside these core symptoms, it is suggested that up to 60% of children with ASD suffer from comorbid anxiety disorders which may further affect educational, social and general development as well as quality of life. The main goal of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a manualized cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) anxiety program adapted for children with ASD. This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Fifty children with ASD and anxiety, aged 7 to 13 years, will be randomly assigned to group CBT or a wait-list control (WL) condition. The design will follow a two (CBT and WL) by two (pre-post assessment) mixed between-within design. The control group will receive intervention after the waitlist period of 13 weeks. Primary outcomes are diagnostic status and severity of the anxiety disorders, measured with The Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule for DSM-IV, Parent and Child Versions. Secondary outcomes are parent and child ratings on questionnaires on the child's level of anxiety and impact on everyday life. Additional outcomes entail information gathered from parents, child and teachers on the child's behavior and negative self-statements, together with social and adaptive skills. Follow-up data will be collected 3 months after intervention. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a manualized CBT program in Danish children with ASD and anxiety within a mental health clinic setting.

Prenatal interventions to ameliorate that risk have yet to be established for clinical use. A systematic review of prenatal nutrients and childhood emotional development and later mental illness was performed. Randomized trials of folic acid, phosphatidylcholine, and omega-3 fatty acid supplements assess effects of doses beyond those adequate to remedy deficiencies to promote normal fetal development despite genetic and environmental risks. Folic acid to prevent neural tube defects is an example. Vitamins A and D are currently recommended at maximum levels, but women's incomplete compliance permits observational studies of their effects. Folic acid and phosphatidylcholine supplements have shown evidence for improving childhood emotional development associated with later mental illnesses. Vitamins A and D decreased the risk for schizophrenia and autism in retrospective observations. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation during early pregnancy increased the risk for schizophrenia and increased symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but in later pregnancy it decreased childhood wheezing and premature birth. Studies are complicated by the length of time between birth and the emergence of mental illnesses like schizophrenia, compared with anomalies like facial clefts identified at birth. As part of comprehensive maternal and fetal care, prenatal nutrient interventions should be further considered as uniquely effective first steps in decreasing risk for future psychiatric and other illnesses in newborn children.

This pilot study addresses this void by investigating neural and behavioral changes in a Phase I trial in young adults with high-functioning ASD who received an evidence-based behavioral intervention, Virtual Reality-Social Cognition Training over 5 weeks for a total of 10 hr. The participants were tested pre- and post-training with a validated biological/social versus scrambled/nonsocial motion neuroimaging task, previously shown to activate regions within the social brain networks. Three significant brain-behavior changes were identified. First, the right posterior superior temporal sulcus, a hub for socio-cognitive processing, showed increased brain activation to social versus nonsocial stimuli in individuals with greater gains on a theory-of-mind measure. Second, the left inferior frontal gyrus, a region for socio-emotional processing, tracked individual gains in emotion recognition with decreased activation to social versus nonsocial stimuli. Finally, the left superior parietal lobule, a region for visual attention, showed significantly decreased activation to nonsocial versus social stimuli across all participants, where heightened attention to nonsocial contingencies has been considered a disabling aspect of ASD. This study provides, albeit preliminary, some of the first evidence of the harnessable neuroplasticity in adults with ASD through an age-appropriate intervention in brain regions tightly linked to social abilities. This pilot trial motivates future efforts to develop and test social interventions to improve behaviors and supporting brain networks in adults with ASD.

Weighted Hedges' g varied from 0.18 (communication-language) to 0.27 (socialization) and averaged 0.23 across domains. We also examined the relationship between outcome and dose of parent training, type of control group, and type of informant (parent and clinician). Outcomes were not significantly different based on dose of treatment. Comparing parent training to treatment-as-usual did not result in significantly different treatment effects than when parent training was compared to an active comparison group. Based on parent report only, treatment effects were significant for communication-language and non-significant for socialization, yet the opposite was found based on clinician-rated tools.

A random effects model was used to present the effect estimate for the outcomes. This study also performed combined meta-analyses of all the three models to investigate the overall effectiveness of the intervention programmes. 32 randomized controlled studies were found to be eligible for inclusion. The synthesized data included 594 children from 14 RCTs. There was no statistically significant difference in the effects on autism general symptoms between the social-communication-focused model and the multimodal developmental model (p = 0.83). The results suggest that there is evidence of an effect on 'reciprocity of social interaction towards others' (standard mean difference [95% confidential interval] = 0.53[0.29,0.78], p<0.01) and 'parental synchrony' (SMD = 0.99[0.70,1.29], p<0.01). The small number of studies included in the present study limited the ability to make inferences when comparing the three models and investigating the strengths and weaknesses of each type of intervention with respect to important outcomes. Since the outcome of 'reciprocity of social interaction towards others' could be a dependent variable that might be context-bound to interactions with the child's parent, we cannot conclude the interventions for pre-school children with ASD have significant effects on a generalized skill to engage in reciprocal interactions with others. However, the outcomes of 'reciprocity of social interaction towards others' and 'parental synchrony' may be promising targets for interventions involving pre-school children with ASD.

We used data from a randomized trial that tested the efficacy of the ESDM, which is based on developmental and applied behavioral analytic principles and delivered by trained therapists and parents, for 2 years. Parents were interviewed about their children's service use every 6 months from the onset of the intervention to follow-up (age 6 years). The sample for this study consisted of 39 children with autism who participated in the original randomized trial at age 18 to 30 months, and were also assessed at age 6 years. Of this sample, 21 children were in the ESDM group, and 18 children were in the community care (COM) group. Reported services were categorized and costed by applying unit hourly costs. Annualized service use and costs during the intervention and post intervention for the two study arms were compared. During the intervention, children who received the ESDM had average annualized total health-related costs that were higher by about $14,000 than those of children who received community-based treatment. The higher cost of ESDM was partially offset during the intervention period because children in the ESDM group used less applied behavior analysis (ABA)/early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) and speech therapy services than children in the comparison group. In the postintervention period, compared with children who had earlier received treatment as usual in community settings, children in the ESDM group used less ABA/EIBI, occupational/physical therapy, and speech therapy services, resulting in significant cost savings in the amount of about $19,000 per year per child. Costs associated with ESDM treatment were fully offset within a few years after the intervention because of reductions in other service use and associated costs.

This study is based on a retrospective review of medical records collected during the activities of psychological and psychosocial unit in the immediate aftermath of earthquake. In total, 529 participants completed the Impact of Event Scale Revised (IES-R) (pre e post treatment). In order to provide a comparison similar to a waitlist-like control group, a method of cohort analysis was applied. In addition, possible time dependent effect was tested.

This study sought to bridge this gap. This 12-week pragmatic randomized controlled trial of SSGT compared to standard care alone was conducted at 13 child and adolescent psychiatry outpatient units in Sweden. Twelve sessions of manualized SSGT (""KONTAKT"") were delivered by regular clinical staff. Participants (N = 296; 88 females and 208 males) were children (n = 172) and adolescents (n = 124) aged 8 to 17 years with ASD without intellectual disability. The primary outcome was the Social Responsiveness Scale rating by parents and blinded teachers. Secondary outcomes included parent- and teacher-rated adaptive behaviors, trainer-rated global functioning and clinical severity, and self-reported child and caregiver stress. Assessments were made at baseline, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up. Moderator analyses were conducted for age and gender. Significant treatment effects on the primary outcome were limited to parent ratings for the adolescent subgroup (posttreatment: -8.3; 95% CI = -14.2 to -1.9; p = .012, effect size [ES] = 0.32; follow-up: -8.6; 95% CI = -15.4 to -1.8; p = .015, ES = 0.33) and females (posttreatment: -8.9; 95% CI = -16.2 to -1.6; p = .019, ES = 0.40). Secondary outcomes indicated moderate effects on adaptive functioning and clinical severity. SSGT for children and adolescents with ASD in regular mental health services is feasible and safe. However, the modest and inconsistent effects underscore the importance of continued efforts to improve SSGT beyond current standards.

This RCT evaluated the efficacy of one technology-based early intervention programme (Therapy Outcomes By You; TOBY) in young children with ASD. TOBY is an app-based learning curriculum designed for children and parents as a complement to early behavioural intervention. Eighty children (16 female) were recruited to this RCT within 12 months of receiving a diagnosis of ASD (M age = 3.38; SD = 0.69) and randomised to receive either treatment-as-usual (community-based intervention, n = 39) or the TOBY therapy (at least 20 min/day) plus treatment-as-usual (n = 41) for a period of 6 months. Outcomes were assessed at 3 and 6 months postbaseline. (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12614000738628; www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=365463). Children in the TOBY intervention group averaged 19 min/day engaging with the app in the first 3 months, but only 2 min/day during the second 3 months. There was no group difference in scores on the primary outcome, the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist, at either the 3- or 6-month follow-up. However, significant improvements at the 6-month follow-up were observed in the TOBY intervention group relative to the treatment-as-usual group on three secondary outcomes: the Fine Motor and Visual Reception subscales of the Mullen Scale of Early Learning and the Total Words Understood scale of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Index. Statistical trends towards improvement in the TOBY intervention group were observed on measures of adaptive function, although these decreased in magnitude from the 3- to 6-month follow-up. This study provides evidence that technology-based interventions may provide a relatively low-cost addition to existing therapist-delivered interventions for children with ASD. However, sustained use of the app over the full 6-month period was a challenge for most families.","Whitehouse Andrew J O, Granich Joanna, Alvares Gail, Busacca Margherita, Cooper Matthew N, Dass Alena, Duong Thi, Harper Rajes, Marshall Wendy, Richdale Amanda, Rodwell Tania, Trembath David, Vellanki Pratibha, Moore Dennis W, Anderson Angelika","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","Autism Spectrum Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Child, Preschool, Computers, Handheld, Early Medical Intervention, Female, Humans, Male, Outcome Assessment, Health Care, Therapy, Computer-Assisted",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28543302,"Telethon Kids Institute, The University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia.; Autism West, Perth, WA, Australia.; Griffith Health Institute, Griffith University, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.; School of Information Technology, Deakin University, Geelong, Vic., Australia.; Olga Tennison Autism Research Centre, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Vic., Australia.; Krongold Centre, Faculty of Education, Monash University, Melbourne, Vic., Australia."

In this exploratory study, we evaluated the effects of a community-based service model with parents as active therapists. 13 children with ASD between 2 and 5 years of age at intake participated in the study. A waiting-list control design was employed. The children received 1 year of home-based EIBI for approximately 20 hours a week, their parents functioning as primary therapists. The waiting-list control group consisted of seven children who were tested 6 months before the intervention commenced. The intervention was based on the University of California at Los Angeles Young Autism Project model (UCLA YAP; Lovaas, 1981, 1987, 2003). The Psychoeducational Profile (3rd ed., PEP-3), the Parenting Stress Index (PSI), and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (2nd ed., CARS 2) were used to measure outcome. In addition, a mental developmental index (MDI) was calculated on the basis of the Cognitive Verbal/Preverbal subscale of the PEP-3. After 1 year of EIBI, we found a significant increase in the PEP-3 scores and MDI scores as well as a significant reduction in the CARS 2 scores. No significant changes were seen when participants were on the waiting list. The stress level of the parents did not change significantly and in fact showed overall a slight decrease. This model of providing EIBI appears to hold some promise. Comprehensive parental involvement did not affect their stress level.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of BRAVE-ONLINE in HFASD children with an anxiety disorder. Forty-two HFASD children, aged 8-12 years, with an anxiety disorder, and their parents, were randomly assigned to either the BRAVE-ONLINE condition (NET) or a waitlist control (WLC). Diagnostic interviews and parent/child questionnaires were completed at pre-treatment, post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. At post- assessment, compared to children in the WLC condition, children in the NET condition demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in number of anxiety diagnoses, clinical severity of diagnosis, and self and parent reported anxiety symptoms, as well as significantly greater increases in overall functioning. However, loss of primary diagnosis in this sample was lower than in previous studies. The small sample size, coupled with attrition rates, makes it difficult to generalise the findings of the study to HFASD population and to conduct analyses regarding mediators, moderators and predictors of outcomes. The BRAVE-ONLINE program may be useful in reducing anxiety symptoms in HFASD children, although the effects are less strong than those found in neurotypical children for a variety of reasons.","Conaughton Rebecca J, Donovan Caroline L, March Sonja",Journal of affective disorders,"Anxiety, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Comorbidity, Female, Humans, Internet, Male, Parents, Surveys and Questionnaires, Telemedicine, Treatment Outcome, Waiting Lists",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28477505,"School of Applied Psychology, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Mount Gravatt Campus, Mount Gravatt, QLD 4122, Australia.

The eight-session intervention program was based on the discrete trial teaching protocol and focused on two basic social skills: eye contact and facial emotion recognition. The robotic interactions occurred in four modules: training element query, recognition of human activity, coping-mode selection, and follow-up action. Children with ASD who were between 4 and 7 years old and who had verbal IQ ≥ 60 were recruited and randomly assigned to the treatment group (TG, n = 8, 5.75 ± 0.89 years) or control group (CG, n = 7; 6.32 ± 1.23 years). The therapeutic robot facilitated the treatment intervention in the TG, and the human assistant facilitated the treatment intervention in the CG. The intervention procedures were identical in both groups. The primary outcome measures included parent-completed questionnaires, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), and frequency of eye contact, which was measured with the partial interval recording method. After completing treatment, the eye contact percentages were significantly increased in both groups. For facial emotion recognition, the percentages of correct answers were increased in similar patterns in both groups compared to baseline (P > 0.05), with no difference between the TG and CG (P > 0.05). The subjects' ability to play, general behavioral and emotional symptoms were significantly diminished after treatment (p < 0.05). These results showed that the robot-facilitated and human-facilitated behavioral interventions had similar positive effects on eye contact and facial emotion recognition, which suggested that robots are useful mediators of social skills training for children with ASD.

To date, thioredoxin (TRX), an antioxidant protein, has been investigated as a marker for psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism but its relationship with depression is yet to be unknown. The aim of this study is to detect the TRX levels in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD), analyse the effect of rTMS (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation) application on TRX levels and display the relationship of TRX with cognitive areas. This study included 27 treatment-resistant unipolar depression patients and 29 healthy subjects. Patients were evaluated by Hamilton Depression Scale (HDRS), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HARS) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) before and after rTMS application. 23 of TRD patients were applied high-frequency rTMS over left DLPFC for 2 to 4weeks and plasma TRX levels of patients and healthy subjects were measured. No significant difference was determined between the TRX levels of patients and healthy subjects (p>0.05). After rTMS application there were significant decrease in severity of depression (p<0.001) and anxiety (p<0.001), and explicit improvement in cognitive areas (delayed memory, visual-spatial/executive abilities and language points) (all p<0.05). No difference was detected in TRX levels of the patients after rTMS application (p>0.005). High language scores of the patients were found to be associated with high TRX levels (p<0.005). Our study indicates that TRX levels cannot be used as a marker for TRD or rTMS treatment in TRD. In spite of this TRX levels have a positive correlation with language functions of the patients of TRD. More extensive studies are required to clarify the mechanism of action of TRX and the effect of TRX on cognitive functions.","Aydın Efruz Pirdoğan, Genç Abdullah, Dalkıran Mihriban, Uyar Ece Türkyilmaz, Deniz İpek, Özer Ömer Akil, Karamustafalıoğlu Kayıhan Oğuz",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,"Adult, Biomarkers, Cognition, Depressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Neuropsychological Tests, Prefrontal Cortex, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Thioredoxins, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28442424,"Department of Psychiatry, Şişli Hamidiye Etfal Teaching and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.; Department of Psychiatry, Şişli Hamidiye Etfal Teaching and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.

Such guidance is provided in the Tackling Teenage Training (TTT) program, in which adolescents with ASD receive psycho-education and practice communicative skills regarding topics related to puberty, sexuality, and intimate relationships. This randomized controlled trial investigated the effects of the TTT program on (a) cognitive outcomes (i.e. psychosexual knowledge, and insight in interpersonal boundaries) and (b) behavioral outcomes (i.e. skills needed for romantic relationships and problematic sexual behavior). A total of 189 cognitively able adolescents with ASD, aged 12-18 years old, were randomized to an intervention condition (n = 95) or a waiting-list control condition (n = 94). We assessed outcomes using self-reported as well as parent-reported questionnaires at baseline (T1), posttreatment (T2; after 6 months), and follow-up (T3; after 12 months). Linear mixed model analyses showed significant treatment effects for psychosexual knowledge and adequate insight in boundaries, both posttreatment and at follow-up. All adolescents increased significantly over time in their social responsiveness and decreased their problematic sexual behavior, irrespectively of condition. The TTT program was most effective for younger adolescents with ASD; following the TTT program resulted in higher psychosexual knowledge, and higher social functioning for these adolescents. The results of this study indicate that the TTT program is effective as a psycho-educational program to provide adolescents with ASD with the knowledge and insight they need to prepare themselves for a healthy psychosexual development. Further research is needed to investigate how this increased knowledge and insight can subsequently ameliorate improvements in romantic skills and prevent the development of problematic sexual behavior and victimization.","Visser Kirsten, Greaves-Lord Kirstin, Tick Nouchka T, Verhulst Frank C, Maras Athanasios, van der Vegt Esther J M","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","Adolescent, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Cognitive Remediation, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice, Humans, Male, Outcome Assessment, Health Care, Sex Education, Social Behavior",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28276079,"Yulius Academy, Yulius Organization for Mental Health, Barendrecht, The Netherlands.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry/psychology, Erasmus MC-Sophia, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."

Previous meta-analysis of the literature on well-designed trials of GSSIs is limited in size and scope, collapsing across highly heterogeneous sources (parents; youths; teachers; observers; behavioral tasks). The current meta-analysis of randomized control trials (RCTs) was conducted to ascertain overall effectiveness of GSSIs and differences by reporting sources. Nineteen RCTs met inclusion criteria. Results show that overall positive aggregate effects were medium (g=0.51, p<0.001).

In conventional techniques, a therapist adjusts the intervention paradigm by monitoring the affective state e.g., anxiety of these individuals for effective floor-time-therapy. Conventional techniques, though powerful, are observation-based and face resource limitations. Technology-assisted systems can provide a quantitative, individualized rehabilitation platform. Presently-available systems are designed primarily to chain learning via aspects of one's performance alone restricting individualization. Specifically, these systems are not sensitive to one's anxiety. Our presented work seeks to bridge this gap by developing a novel VR-based interactive system with Anxiety-Sensitive adaptive technology. Specifically, such a system is capable of objectively identifying and quantifying one's anxiety level from real-time biomarkers, along with performance metrics. In turn it can adaptively respond in an individualized manner to foster improved social communication skills. In our present research, we have used Virtual Reality (VR) to design a proof-of-concept application that exposes participants to social tasks of varying challenges. Results of a preliminary usability study indicate the potential of our VR-based Anxiety-Sensitive system to foster improved task performance, thereby serving as a potent complementary tool in the hands of therapist.","Kuriakose Selvia, Lahiri Uttama",IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,"Adolescent, Anxiety, Autistic Disorder, Biofeedback, Psychology, Child, Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted, Equipment Design, Equipment Failure Analysis, Female, Humans, Interpersonal Relations, Male, Reproducibility of Results, Sensitivity and Specificity, Social Communication Disorder, Therapy, Computer-Assisted, Treatment Outcome, User-Computer Interface",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28114071,

Treatment options to ameliorate symptoms of ASDs are limited. Heterogeneity complicates the quest for personalized medicine in this population. Our aim was to investigate if there are baseline characteristics of patients that moderate response or trial design features that impede the identification of efficacious interventions for ASDs. Literature searches of EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO identified 43 studies for qualitative assessment of baseline characterization of participants and 37 studies for quantitative analysis of moderators of treatment response. Criteria included blinded randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in paediatric ASD, with at least 10 participants per arm or 20 overall, of oral treatments, including pharmacological interventions and dietary supplements. Random-effects meta-analysis of 1997 participants (81% male) identified three moderators associated with an increase in treatment response: trials located in Europe and the Middle-East; outcome measures designated primary status; and the type of outcome measure. Inconsistent reporting of baseline symptom severity and intellectual functioning prevented analysis of these variables. Qualitative synthesis of baseline characteristics identified at least 31 variables, with only age and gender reported in all trials. Biological markers were included in six RCTs. Few trials reported adequate baseline characteristics to permit detailed analysis of response to treatment. Consideration of geographical location, baseline severity and intellectual function is required to ensure generalizability of results. The use of biological markers and correlates in ASD trials remains in its infancy. There is great need to improve the application of baseline characterization and incorporation of biological markers and correlates to permit selection of participants into homogeneous subgroups and to inform response to treatment in ASD.","Masi A, Lampit A, DeMayo M M, Glozier N, Hickie I B, Guastella A J",Psychological medicine,"Child, Humans, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Outcome Assessment, Health Care, Research Design, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28091344,"Autism Clinic for Translational Research,Brain and Mind Centre,Central Clinical School,Sydney Medical School,University of Sydney,Camperdown,NSW,Australia.; Regenerative Neuroscience Group,Brain and Mind Centre,University of Sydney,Camperdown,NSW,Australia."

It aims to combine new pathophysiologically based treatments with objective tests (stratification biomarkers) to predict which treatment may be beneficial for a particular person. Here we discuss significant advances and current challenges for this approach: rare monogenic forms of ASD have provided a major breakthrough for the identification of treatment targets by providing a means to trace causal links from a gene to specific molecular alterations and biological pathways. To estimate whether treatment targets thus identified may be useful for larger patient groups we need a better understanding of whether different etiologies (i.e., genetic and environmental risk factors acting at different critical time points) lead to convergent or divergent molecular mechanisms, and how they map onto differences in circuit-level brain and cognitive development, and behavioral symptom profiles. Several recently failed clinical trials with syndromic forms of ASD provide valuable insights into conceptual and methodological issues linked to limitations in the translatability from animal models to humans, placebo effects, and a need for mechanistically plausible, objective outcome measures. To identify stratification biomarkers that enrich participant selection in clinical trials, large-scale multi-modal longitudinal observational studies are underway. Addressing these different factors in the next generation of research studies requires a translatable developmental perspective and multidisciplinary, collaborative efforts, with a commitment to sharing protocols and data, to increase transparency and reproducibility.","Loth Eva, Murphy Declan G, Spooren Will",Frontiers in psychiatry,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27965598,"Roche Pharmaceutical Research and Early Development, NORD Discovery and Translational Area, Roche Innovation Center , Basel , Switzerland.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK; Sackler Institute for Translational Neurodevelopment, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."

The social deficits that characterize ASD may relate to reduced connectivity between brain sites on the mesolimbic reward pathway (nucleus accumbens; amygdala) that receive OT projections and contribute to social motivation, and cortical sites involved in social perception. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, we show that OT administration in ASD increases activity in brain regions important for perceiving social-emotional information. Further, OT enhances connectivity between nodes of the brain's reward and socioemotional processing systems, and does so preferentially for social (versus nonsocial) stimuli. This effect is observed both while viewing coherent versus scrambled biological motion, and while listening to happy versus angry voices.

Presently, no therapies are available to effectively treat individuals with all of the symptoms of this disorder. It has been suggested that hyperbaric oxygen therapy may alleviate the biochemical dysfunction and clinical symptoms of ASD. To determine whether treatment with hyperbaric oxygen:1. improves core symptoms of ASD, including social communication problems and stereotypical and repetitive behaviors;2. improves noncore symptoms of ASD, such as challenging behaviors;3. improves comorbid states, such as depression and anxiety; and4. causes adverse effects. On 10 December 2015, we searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and 15 other databases, four of which were Chinese language databases. We also searched multiple trial and research registers. We selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of any dose, duration, and frequency for hyperbaric oxygen therapy compared with no treatment or sham treatment for children and adults with ASD. We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration, in that three review authors independently selected studies, assessed them for risk of bias, and extracted relevant data. We also assessed the quality of the evidence by using the GRADE approach. We included one trial with a total of 60 children with a diagnosis of ASD who randomly received hyperbaric oxygen therapy or a sham treatment. Using GRADE criteria, we rated the quality of the evidence as low because of the small sample size and wide confidence intervals (CIs). Other problems included selection bias and short duration or follow-up.Overall, study authors reported no improvement in social interaction and communication, behavioral problems, communication and linguistic abilities, or cognitive function. With regard to the safety of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (adverse events), they reported minor-grade ear barotrauma events. Investigators found significant differences between groups in total number of side effect events (Peto odds ratio (OR) 3.87, 95% CI 1.53 to 9.82) and in the number of children who experienced side effects (Peto OR 4.40, 95% CI 1.33 to 14.48). To date, there is no evidence that hyperbaric oxygen therapy improves core symptoms and associated symptoms of ASD. It is important to note that adverse effects (minor-grade ear barotrauma events) can occur. Given the absence of evidence of effectiveness and the limited biological plausibility and possible adverse effects, the need for future RCTs of hyperbaric oxygen therapy must be carefully considered.","Xiong Tao, Chen Hongju, Luo Rong, Mu Dezhi",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Cognition, Communication, Humans, Hyperbaric Oxygenation, Interpersonal Relations, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27737490,"Department of Pediatrics, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, No. 17, Section Three, Ren Min Nan Lu Avenue, Chengdu, Sichuan, China, 610041."
27798253,10.1093/Scan/Nsw150,Oxytocin receptor gene variations predict neural and behavioral response to oxytocin in autism.,2017-03-01,"Oxytocin appears beneficial for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and more than 20 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in oxytocin receptor (OXTR) are relevant to ASD. However, neither biological functions of OXTR SNPs in ASD nor critical OXTR SNPs that determine oxytocin's effects on ASD remains known. Here, using a machine-learning algorithm that was designed to evaluate collective effects of multiple SNPs and automatically identify most informative SNPs, we examined relationships between 27 representative OXTR SNPs and six types of behavioral/neural response to oxytocin in ASD individuals. The oxytocin effects were extracted from our previous placebo-controlled within-participant clinical trial administering single-dose intranasal oxytocin to 38 high-functioning adult Japanese ASD males. Consequently, we identified six different SNP sets that could accurately predict the six different oxytocin efficacies, and confirmed the robustness of these SNP selections against variations of the datasets and analysis parameters. Moreover, major alleles of several prominent OXTR SNPs-including rs53576 and rs2254298-were found to have dissociable effects on the oxytocin efficacies. These findings suggest biological functions of the OXTR SNP variants on autistic oxytocin responses, and implied that clinical oxytocin efficacy may be genetically predicted before its actual administration, which would contribute to establishment of future precision medicines for ASD.","Watanabe Takamitsu, Otowa Takeshi, Abe Osamu, Kuwabara Hitoshi, Aoki Yuta, Natsubori Tatsunobu, Takao Hidemasa, Kakiuchi Chihiro, Kondo Kenji, Ikeda Masashi, Iwata Nakao, Kasai Kiyoto, Sasaki Tsukasa, Yamasue Hidenori",Social cognitive and affective neuroscience,"Adolescent, Adult, Algorithms, Alleles, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Genetic Variation, Genotype, Humans, Machine Learning, Male, Oxytocin, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Receptors, Oxytocin, Social Behavior, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27798253,"Department of Radiology Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.; Department of Physical and Health Education Graduate School of Education, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.; Department of Neuropsychiatry Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.; Disability Services Office.; Department of Radiology, Nihon University School of Medicine, 30-1 Oyaguchikami-cho, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo 173-8610, Japan.; Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, 17 Queen Square, London WC1N 3AZ, UK.; Department of Psychiatry Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Aichi 470-1192, Japan."

High-intensity and sustained delivery of quality EIBI is expensive. The TOBY (Therapy Outcomes by You) Playpad is an App-based platform delivering EIBI to facilitate learning for young children with ASD, while enabling parents to become co-therapists. Intervention targets include increasing joint attention, imitation and communication of children with ASD. The primary aim of the study presented in this protocol is to determine the effectiveness of the TOBY App in reducing ASD symptoms when used as a complement to conventional EIBI. The secondary aim is to examine parental attributes as a result of TOBY App use. Children aged less than 4;3 years diagnosed with ASD and parents will be recruited into this single-blind, randomised controlled trial using a pragmatic approach. Eligible participants will be randomised to the treatment group 'TOBY therapy + therapy as usual' or, the control group 'therapy as usual' for six months. The treatment will be provided by the TOBY App and parent where a combination of learning environments such as on-iPad child only (solo), partner (with parent) and off-iPad - Natural Environment (with parent) Tasks will be implemented. Parents in the treatment group will participate in a TOBY training workshop. Treatment fidelity will be monitored via an App-based reporting system and parent diaries. The primary outcome measure is the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist. The secondary outcome measures involve diagnostics, functional and developmental assessments, including parent questionnaires at baseline (T0), three months (T1) and six months (T2). This trial will determine the effectiveness of the TOBY App as a therapeutic complement to other early interventions children with ASD receive. The trial will also determine the feasibility of a parent delivered early intervention using the iPad as an educational platform, and assess the impact of the TOBY App on parents' self-efficacy and empowerment in an effort to reduce children's ASD symptoms. The outcomes of this trial may have EIBI services implications for newly diagnosed children with ASD and parents. ACTRN12614000738628 retrospectively registered on 1<sup>st</sup> of July, 2014.

No effective pharmacotherapy for these core deficits exists. Within the domain of social communication, the vasopressin system is implicated in social cognition and social signaling deficits of ASD, and represents a potential therapeutic target. We assessed the effects of a single 20 mg intravenous dose of the arginine vasopressin receptor 1A (V1a) antagonist, RG7713, on exploratory biomarkers (eye tracking), behavioral and clinical measures of social cognition and communication (affective speech recognition (ASR), reading the mind in the eyes, olfactory identification, scripted interaction), and safety and tolerability in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of 19 high-functioning adult male subjects with DSM-IV Autistic Disorder (age 18-45 years; full scale IQ >70; ABC-Irritability subscale ⩽13). Eye-tracking showed an increase in biological motion orienting preference with RG7713 (ES=0.8, p=0.047) and a non-significant improvement in the composite score (ES=0.2, p=0.29). RG7713 reduced ability to detect lust (ES=-0.8, p=0.03) and fear (ES=-0.7, p=0.07) in ASR. However, when all eight individual emotion subscales were combined into an overall ASR performance score, the reduction was non-significant (ES=-0.1, p=0.59). Thirteen adverse events were reported in 10 subjects; all were of mild (11/13) or moderate (2/13) severity. Although interpretation should be cautious due to multiple comparisons and small sample size, these results provide preliminary evidence from experimental and behavioral biomarkers, that blockade of the V1a receptor may improve social communication in adults with high-functioning ASD.

These features are common and can have an often-devastating impact on autistic individuals and their families. Yet there are few validated interventions that help to remediate or support autistic individuals' adverse sensory experiences. To date, both measurement of sensory experiences and the resulting interventions have been based on assumptions of neurological sensitivities and largely ignored the role of cognition. This study therefore sought to assess the feasibility of a new 8-week CBT-based group intervention for self-regulation of sensory processing difficulties. Seven cognitively able adolescents diagnosed with autism aged 11-16 years from one mainstream secondary school received the 8-week intervention. Measures of sensory reactivity, anxiety and repetitive behaviours were taken at baseline, post-intervention and follow-up, 8 weeks after the intervention had ceased. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were also conducted with adolescents and their parents to examine further the acceptability of the intervention. The results showed that the intervention itself was feasible - both in its implementation and its acceptability to participants. Qualitative analysis clearly showed that the intervention was effective in raising meta-conscious awareness and self-regulation in these autistic adolescents. Analysis of outcome variables showed no significant change over the intervention period, although effect sizes were moderate-to-large. These preliminary results are encouraging and should inform the design of a future pilot randomized controlled trial to test its efficacy with a larger group of participants.","Edgington Louise, Hill Vivian, Pellicano Elizabeth",Research in developmental disabilities,"Adolescent, Anxiety, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Feasibility Studies, Focus Groups, Humans, Male, Metacognition, Patient Acceptance of Health Care, Psychotherapy, Group, Qualitative Research, Self-Control, Sensation, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27639063,"Centre for Research in Autism and Education (CRAE), UCL Institute of Education, University College London, UK; School of Psychology, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.

Oxytocin (OT) and cortisol are key neuromodulators of biological and behavioral responses, show a synergistic effect, and have been implicated in the neuropathological profile in ASD. However, they are rarely investigated together. The purpose of the pilot study was to evaluate the relationship between cortisol and OT in children with ASD under baseline and physiological stress (hydrocortisone challenge) conditions. Arginine vasopressin (AVP), structurally similar to OT, was also examined. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomly assigned, crossover design was employed in 25 children 8-to-12 years with ASD (N = 14) or typical development (TD, N = 11). A low dose of hydrocortisone and placebo were administered via liquid suspension. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine the within-subject factor ""Condition"" (hydrocortisone/placebo) and ""Time"" (pre and post) and the between-subject factor ""Group"" (ASD vs. TD). Pearson correlations examined the relationship between hormone levels and clinical profile. There was a significant Time × Condition × Group interaction F (1.23) = 4.18, p = 0.05 showing a rise in OT during the experimental condition (hydrocortisone) and a drop during the placebo condition for the TD group but not the ASD group. There were no group differences for AVP. Hormone levels were associated with social profiles. For the TD group, an inverse relationship was observed. OT increased during physiological challenge suggesting that OT played a stress-buffering role during cortisol administration. In contrast for the ASD group, OT remained unchanged or decreased during both the physiological challenge and the placebo condition, suggesting that OT failed to serve as a stress buffer under conditions of physiological stress. While OT has been tied to the social ability of children with ASD, the diminished moderating effect of OT on cortisol may also play a contributory role in the heightened stress often observed in children with ASD. These results contribute to our understanding of the growing complexity of the effects of OT on social behavior as well as the functional interplay and differential regulation OT may have on stress modulation.","Corbett Blythe A, Bales Karen L, Swain Deanna, Sanders Kevin, Weinstein Tamara A R, Muglia Louis J",Journal of neurodevelopmental disorders,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27540420,"Department of Pediatrics, Perinatal Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH USA.; University of California, Davis, CA USA.; Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA USA.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Vanderbilt University, PMB 40, 230 Appleton Place, Nashville, TN 37203 USA ; Vanderbilt Kennedy Center for Research on Human Development, Nashville, TN USA ; Department of Psychology, Vanderbilt University, Nasvhille, TN USA.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Vanderbilt University, PMB 40, 230 Appleton Place, Nashville, TN 37203 USA."

This was a 24-week, 6-site, randomized trial of parent training versus parent education in 180 children with ASD (aged 3-7 years; 158 boys and 22 girls) and moderate or greater behavioral problems. Parent training included specific strategies to manage disruptive behavior over 11 to 13 sessions, 2 telephone boosters, and 2 home visits. Parent education provided useful information about autism but no behavior management strategies over 12 core sessions and 1 home visit. In a previous report, we showed that parent training was superior to parent education in reducing disruptive behavior in young children with ASD. Here, we test whether parent training is superior to parent education in improving daily living skills as measured by the parent-rated Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales II. The long-term impact of parent training on adaptive functioning is also presented. At week 24, the parent training group showed a 5.7-point improvement from baseline on the Daily Living domain compared to no change in parent education (p = .004; effect size = 0.36). On the Socialization domain, there was a 5.9-point improvement in parent training versus a 3.1-point improvement in parent education (p = .11; effect size = 0.29). Gains in the Communication domain were similar across treatment groups. The gain in Daily Living was greater in children with IQ of >70. However, the interaction of treatment-by-IQ was not significant. Gains in Daily Living at week 24 were maintained upon re-evaluation at 24 weeks posttreatment. These results support the model that reduction in disruptive behavior can lead to improvement in activities of daily living. By contrast, the expected trajectory for adaptive behavior in children with ASD is often flat and predictably declines in children with intellectual disability. In the parent training group, higher-functioning children achieved significant gains in daily living skills. Children with intellectual disability kept pace with time.

Therapeutic approaches to date have focused on skills acquisition, support tailored to the characteristics of autism spectrum disorder, and interventions in social cognitive functioning; there have been few reports describing interventions aimed at neurocognitive dysfunction. In this study, we focus on impairment of executive functioning in autism spectrum disorder patients and investigate improvements in executive functioning and their generalization to social functioning. The intervention adopted for this study was cognitive remediation therapy using the frontal/executive program. To investigate the effectiveness of frontal/executive program, 15 subjects who consented to participate in the study were randomly assigned to an intervention group or control group. Frontal/executive program was administered to the intervention group for about six months. Both groups were evaluated using the same scales: BACS-J, WCST, and CPT for cognitive assessment; SCoRS-J, GAF, and LASMI for social functioning; and GSE for self-efficacy. Both groups had lower scores for cognitive functioning than normal individuals at baseline. After completion of frontal/executive program, the intervention group showed improved performance on BACS-J for overall score, digit sequencing, verbal fluency, and Tower of London tasks. Improvements were also seen on SCoRS-J and LASMI scales of social functioning. This was the first study to use frontal/executive program to focus on neurocognitive dysfunction in autism spectrum disorder patients.

Pretest adjusted, between-group differences were analyzed for state-anxiety, trait-anxiety, play-based cortisol, and diurnal cortisol. Pearson correlations were conducted between anxiety, cortisol, and group play. Significant pretest-adjusted between-group differences at posttest were observed on trait-anxiety (F(1, 27) = 9.16, p = 0.005) but not state-anxiety (F(1, 27) = 0.03, p = 0.86), showing lower trait-anxiety in the experimental group.

27142139,10.1016/J.Mehy.2016.04.010,The future of neonatal BCG.,2016-06-01,"We hypothesise that neonatal BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) might be used to adapt to a new phase in the history of human births. Among most mammals, the placenta is not effective at transferring antibodies to the fetus: antibodies are transferred immediately after birth via the colostrum. Among humans (and other mammals with hemochorial placentas) the transplacental transfer of antibodies (namely IgG) is effective. In humans, foetal concentrations of IgG sub-classes approximate to maternal concentrations at 38weeks and continue to increase thereafter. These facts explain inter-species differences regarding the basic needs of neonates. Among most mammals, the early colostrum is, strictly speaking, vital. Among humans, the main questions are about the bacteriological environment in the birthing place and how familiar it is to the mother. Today, most human beings are born in unfamiliar bacteriological environments characterized by a low microbial diversity. The effects of clinical environments may be amplified by the use of antibiotics and birth by caesarean, i.e. by-passing the bacteriologically rich perineal zone. There is already an accumulation of data confirming that the maturation of a balanced Th1/Th2 immune response is affected by the mode of delivery. There is also an accumulation of epidemiological studies detecting risk factors in the perinatal period for health conditions such as type 1 diabetes (and other autoimmune diseases), atopy, autism and obesity. In such a context there are reasons to plan randomized controlled trials with long term follow-up of the effects of BCG given immediately after birth, as a modulator of Th-1/Th-2 responses. A follow-up period in the region of 6-10years would be long enough to evaluate the prevalence of several nosologically well defined diseases. These studies would be ethically acceptable, since BCG is the only infancy vaccine that has been evaluated through randomised controlled trials with long term follow-up. Furthermore, whatever the standard of living of the populations and the research protocols, concordant results suggest that BCG has positive non-specific long term effects on health. Meanwhile, some simple adaptive practices are possible, such as, after a caesarean section, wrapping the neonate in clothes recently worn by the mother and, occasionally, putting the neonate in the arms of a person who is cohabiting with the mother.",Odent Michel R,Medical hypotheses,"Animals, Antibodies, BCG Vaccine, Cesarean Section, Colostrum, Female, Fetus, Humans, Immunoglobulin G, Infant, Newborn, Parturition, Placenta, Pregnancy, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Risk Factors, Th1 Cells, Th2 Cells, Time Factors, Vaccination",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27142139,"Primal Health Research Centre, 72 Savernake Road, London NW3 2JR, UK.

Neuroimaging studies have shown that superior temporal sulcus (STS) is highly implicated in eye-gaze perception. In autism, a lack of preference for the eyes, as well as anatomo-functional abnormalities within the STS, has been described. To date, there are no experimental data in humans showing whether it is possible to interfere with eye-gaze processing by modulating STS neural activity. Here, we measured eye-gaze perception before and after inhibitory transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied over the posterior STS (pSTS) in young healthy volunteers. Eye-gaze processing, namely overt orienting toward the eyes, was measured using eye tracking during passive visualization of social movies. Inhibition of the right pSTS led participants to look less to the eyes of characters during visualization of social movies. Such effect was specific for the eyes and was not observed after inhibition of the left pSTS nor after placebo TMS. These results indicate for the first time that interfering with the right pSTS neural activity transitorily disrupts the behavior of orienting toward the eyes and thus indirectly gaze perception, a fundamental process for human social cognition. These results could open up new perspectives in therapeutic interventions in autism.","Saitovitch Ana, Popa Traian, Lemaitre Hervé, Rechtman Elza, Lamy Jean-Charles, Grévent David, Calmon Raphael, Meunier Sabine, Brunelle Francis, Samson Yves, Boddaert Nathalie, Zilbovicius Monica","Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)","Cognition, Eye Movement Measurements, Female, Fixation, Ocular, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Neural Inhibition, Social Perception, Temporal Lobe, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Visual Perception, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26946130,"Inserm U1127, CNRS UMR 7225, Sorbonne Universités, UPMC Univ.

Treatment effects were measured using change scores for siblings on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire - Parent Version (SDQ). Seven predictors were analysed: symptom severity of the child with special needs, participant age and gender, sibling birth order, family socio-economic status, participant baseline SDQ score and participant use of additional support services. The overall model significantly predicted change in SDQ scores at post-intervention and follow-up (adjusted R(2) = 0.41 and 0.40).

Growing public concern and refusal to vaccinate poses a serious public health risk. Evaluations of recent pro-vaccine health communication interventions have revealed mixed results (at best). This study investigated whether highlighting consensus among medical scientists about childhood vaccine safety can lower public concern, reduce key misperceptions about the discredited autism-vaccine link and promote overall support for vaccines. American adults (N = 206) were invited participate in an online survey experiment. Participants were randomly assigned to either a control group or to one of three treatment interventions. The treatment messages were based on expert-consensus estimates and either normatively described or prescribed the extant medical consensus: ""90 % of medical scientists agree that vaccines are safe and that all parents should be required to vaccinate their children"". Compared to the control group, the consensus-messages significantly reduced vaccine concern (M = 3.51 vs. M = 2.93, p < 0.01) and belief in the vaccine-autism-link (M = 3.07 vs M = 2.15, p < 0.01) while increasing perceived consensus about vaccine safety (M = 83.93 vs M = 89.80, p < 0.01) and public support for vaccines (M = 5.66 vs M = 6.22, p < 0.01). Mediation analysis further revealed that the public's understanding of the level of scientific agreement acts as an important ""gateway"" belief by promoting public attitudes and policy support for vaccines directly as well as indirectly by reducing endorsement of the discredited autism-vaccine link. These findings suggest that emphasizing the medical consensus about (childhood) vaccine safety is likely to be an effective pro-vaccine message that could help prevent current immunization rates from declining.

ASD clients may need help to detect the invisible code of social interaction and communication. The level of anxiety and the frequency of target behavior were measured. Four assessments were made, two at the pre-assessment, and one in mid-therapy and end of therapy respectively.

The goal is to effectuate a behavioural modification by modulating brain activity. The EEG NF opens new therapeutic possibilities in the fields of psychiatry and neurology. However, the development of EEG NF in clinical practice requires (i) a good level of evidence of therapeutic efficacy of this technique, (ii) a good practice guide for this technique. Firstly, this article investigates selected trials with the following criteria: study design with controlled, randomized, and open or blind protocol, primary endpoint related to the mental and brain disorders treated and assessed with standardized measurement tools, identifiable EEG neurophysiological targets, underpinned by pathophysiological relevance. Trials were found for: epilepsies, migraine, stroke, chronic insomnia, attentional-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, addictive disorders, psychotic disorders. Secondly, this article investigates the principles of neurofeedback therapy in line with learning theory. Different underlying therapeutic models are presented didactically between two continua: a continuum between implicit and explicit learning and a continuum between the biomedical model (centred on ""the disease"") and integrative biopsychosocial model of health (centred on ""the illness"").

This study tests the relationship between isolated core components of a packaged social communication intervention and the primary outcome, joint engagement, to better understand how the intervention is affecting change in individuals. A total of 86 toddlers and their parents were enrolled in the study and randomized to one of two treatments, the joint attention, symbolic play, engagement, and regulation (JASPER) parent-mediated intervention or a psychoeducational intervention. Measures regarding the parent's use of intervention strategies were collected before and after the 10-week intervention. Additional measures of child and parent joint engagement were also collected. A significant effect of treatment was found for all four of the core strategies of the intervention, favoring a larger increase in the JASPER condition. A hierarchical linear regression revealed several individual predictors of joint engagement, including parent-rated buy-in, interventionist-rated parent involvement, and parental use of strategies. To complement the hierarchical analysis, we also tested the potential mediating effect the strategies may have on the relationship between treatment and joint engagement. Results showed that the strategy of mirrored pacing mediated the relationship between treatment and joint engagement in the positive direction. These results strongly suggest that the mirrored pacing strategy is an active ingredient of the JASPER treatment.","Gulsrud Amanda C, Hellemann Gerhard, Shire Stephanie, Kasari Connie","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Preschool, Evidence-Based Practice, Family Therapy, Female, Humans, Male, Outcome Assessment, Health Care, Parent-Child Relations, Parents",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26525461,"UCLA Semel Institute for Neuroscience & Human Behavior, Los Angeles, CA, USA."

Although it is often assumed that core behaviors in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) rarely remit spontaneously, there has been limited investigation of the size of the placebo response in relevant clinical trials. These trials also rely on caregiver and clinical observer reports as outcome measures. The objectives of this meta-analysis are to identify the pooled placebo response and the predictors of placebo response in pharmacological and dietary supplement treatment trials for participants with a diagnosis of ASD. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in pediatric ASD, conducted between 1980 and August 2014, were identified through a search of Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and clinicaltrials.gov. RCTs of at least 14 days duration, comparing the treatment response for an oral active agent and placebo using at least one of the common outcome measures, were included. Analysis of 25 data sets (1315 participants) revealed a moderate effect size for overall placebo response (Hedges' g=0.45, 95% confidence interval (0.34-0.56), P<0.001). Five factors were associated with an increase in response to placebo, namely: an increased response to the active intervention; outcome ratings by clinicians (as compared with caregivers); trials of pharmacological and adjunctive interventions; and trials located in Iran.

However, no studies have examined the influence of neuro-enhancement by using excitatory high-frequency (20Hz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) on these networks. We used three forms of TMS stimulation (HF-rTMS, single and paired pulse) to investigate whether the mirror neuron system facilitates the motor system during goal-directed action observation relative to inanimate motion (motor resonance), a marker of putative mirror neuron activity. 31 healthy individuals were randomized to receive single-sessions of true or sham HF-rTMS delivered to the left inferior frontal gyrus - a component of the human mirror system. Motor resonance was assessed before and after HF-rTMS using three TMS cortical reactivity paradigms: (a) 120% of resting motor threshold (RMT), (b) stimulus intensity set to evoke motor evoked potential of 1-millivolt amplitude (SI1mV) and (c) a short latency paired pulse paradigm. Two-way RMANOVA showed a significant group (true versus sham) X occasion (pre- and post-HF-rTMS motor resonance) interaction effect for SI1mV [F(df)=6.26 (1, 29), p=0.018] and 120% RMT stimuli [F(df)=7.01 (1, 29), p=0.013] indicating greater enhancement of motor resonance in the true HF-rTMS group than the sham-group. This suggests that HF-rTMS could adaptively modulate properties of the mirror neuron system.

This group of children was assessed at age 6 years, 2 years after the intervention ended, across multiple domains of functioning by clinicians naive to previous intervention group status. The ESDM group, on average, maintained gains made in early intervention during the 2-year follow-up period in overall intellectual ability, adaptive behavior, symptom severity, and challenging behavior. No group differences in core autism symptoms were found immediately posttreatment; however, 2 years later, the ESDM group demonstrated improved core autism symptoms and adaptive behavior as compared with the community-intervention-as-usual (COM) group. The 2 groups were not significantly different in terms of intellectual functioning at age 6 years. Both groups received equivalent intervention hours during the original study, but the ESDM group received fewer hours during the follow-up period.

This 24-week randomized trial compared parent training (n = 89) to parent education (n = 91) at 6 centers (Emory University, Indiana University, Ohio State University, University of Pittsburgh, University of Rochester, Yale University). We screened 267 children; 180 children (aged 3-7 years) with autism spectrum disorder and disruptive behaviors were randomly assigned (86% white, 88% male) between September 2010 and February 2014. Parent training (11 core, 2 optional sessions; 2 telephone boosters; 2 home visits) provided specific strategies to manage disruptive behavior. Parent education (12 core sessions, 1 home visit) provided information about autism but no behavior management strategies. Parents rated disruptive behavior and noncompliance on co-primary outcomes: the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability subscale (range, 0-45) and the Home Situations Questionnaire-Autism Spectrum Disorder (range, 0-9). On both measures, higher scores indicate greater severity and a 25% reduction indicates clinical improvement. A clinician blind to treatment assignment rated the Improvement scale of the Clinical Global Impression (range, 1-7), a secondary outcome, with a positive response less than 3. At week 24, the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability subscale declined 47.7% in parent training (from 23.7 to 12.4) compared with 31.8% for parent education (23.9 to 16.3) (treatment effect, -3.9; 95% CI, -6.2 to -1.7; P < .001, standardized effect size = 0.62). The Home Situations Questionnaire-Autism Spectrum Disorder declined 55% (from 4.0 to 1.8) compared with 34.2% in parent education (3.8 to 2.5) (treatment effect, -0.7; 95% CI, -1.1 to -0.3; P < .001, standardized effect size = 0.45).

Sixty-nine children with ASD, 8 to 11 years of age, with verbal IQs greater than 70, participated in a randomized comparative trial to examine the efficacy of NETT relative to a facilitated play group. Treatment outcomes included caregiver reports of social behavior and neuropsychological assessments of social cognition conducted by blinded raters. Outcomes were collected at baseline, endpoint, and 3 months posttreatment. Significant improvements were found on social behavior outcomes such as nonverbal communication, empathic responding, and social relations in the NETT condition relative to the active control at endpoint. Verbal IQ moderated the interaction effect on social behavior, with higher verbal IQ associated with improvements in the CBI condition. No significant improvements were found on social cognitive outcomes. No significant group differences were found at 3-month follow-up conducted with approximately half the sample (n = 34). These data indicate that targeted CBI social skills groups such as NETT improve social communication deficits in verbal, school-aged children with ASD.

Strikingly, the groups exhibited differential neural responses to treatment: The five children who exhibited hypoactivation at baseline evidenced increased activation in components of the reward system including the ventral striatum and putamen. The five children who exhibited hyperactivation at baseline evidenced decreased activation in subcortical regions critical for regulating the flow of stimulation and conveying signals of salience to the cortex-the thalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus.

Finally, individual-ESI showed differential change on examiner-administered measures of receptive language skills, as children in individual-ESI improved significantly, whereas group-ESI showed no change. These findings support the efficacy of individual-ESI compared with group-ESI on child outcomes, suggesting the importance of individualized parent coaching in natural environments.

The aim of this study was to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate PRT parent training group (PRTG) for targeting language deficits in young children with ASD. Fifty-three children with autism and significant language delay between 2 and 6 years old were randomized to PRTG (N = 27) or psychoeducation group (PEG; N = 26) for 12 weeks. The PRTG taught parents behavioral techniques to facilitate language development. The PEG taught general information about ASD (clinical trial NCT01881750; http://www.clinicaltrials.gov). Analysis of child utterances during the structured laboratory observation (primary outcome) indicated that, compared with children in the PEG, children in the PRTG demonstrated greater improvement in frequency of utterances (F(2, 43) = 3.53, p = .038, d = 0.42). Results indicated that parents were able to learn PRT in a group format, as the majority of parents in the PRTG (84%) met fidelity of implementation criteria after 12 weeks. Children also demonstrated greater improvement in adaptive communication skills (Vineland-II) following PRTG and baseline Mullen visual reception scores predicted treatment response to PRTG. This is the first randomized controlled trial of group-delivered PRT and one of the largest experimental investigations of the PRT model to date. The findings suggest that specific instruction in PRT results in greater skill acquisition for both parents and children, especially in functional and adaptive communication skills. Further research in PRT is warranted to replicate the observed results and address other core ASD symptoms.","Hardan Antonio Y, Gengoux Grace W, Berquist Kari L, Libove Robin A, Ardel Christina M, Phillips Jennifer, Frazier Thomas W, Minjarez Mendy B","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","Age Factors, Autistic Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Child, Child, Preschool, Female, Humans, Language Development Disorders, Male, Parents, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25346345,"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; Center for Autism, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.; Seattle Children's Hospital/Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, WA, USA."

25190094,10.1016/J.Ridd.2014.08.021,Comparison of behavior analytic and eclectic early interventions for young children with autism after three years.,2014-12-01,"In a previous study, we compared the effects of just over one year of intensive behavior analytic intervention (IBT) provided to 29 young children diagnosed with autism with two eclectic (i.e., mixed-method) interventions (Howard, Sparkman, Cohen, Green, & Stanislaw, 2005). One eclectic intervention (autism programming; AP) was designed specifically for children with autism and was intensive in that it was delivered for an average of 25-30 h per week (n = 16). The other eclectic intervention (generic programming; GP) was delivered to 16 children with a variety of diagnoses and needs for an average of 15-17 h per week. This paper reports outcomes for children in all three groups after two additional years of intervention. With few exceptions, the benefits of IBT documented in our first study were sustained throughout Years 2 and 3. At their final assessment, children who received IBT were more than twice as likely to score in the normal range on measures of cognitive, language, and adaptive functioning than were children who received either form of eclectic intervention. Significantly more children in the IBT group than in the other two groups had IQ, language, and adaptive behavior test scores that increased by at least one standard deviation from intake to final assessment. Although the largest improvements for children in the IBT group generally occurred during Year 1, many children in that group whose scores were below the normal range after the first year of intervention attained scores in the normal range of functioning with one or two years of additional intervention. In contrast, children in the two eclectic treatment groups were unlikely to attain scores in the normal range after the first year of intervention, and many of those who had scores in the normal range in the first year fell out of the normal range in subsequent years. There were no consistent differences in outcomes at Years 2 and 3 between the two groups who received eclectic interventions. These results provide further evidence that intensive behavior analytic intervention delivered at an early age is more likely to produce substantial improvements in young children with autism than common eclectic interventions, even when the latter are intensive.","Howard Jane S, Stanislaw Harold, Green Gina, Sparkman Coleen R, Cohen Howard G",Research in developmental disabilities,"Autistic Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Child, Child, Preschool, Combined Modality Therapy, Early Intervention, Educational, Humans, Longitudinal Studies, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25190094,"California State University, Stanislaus, Psychology Department, 1 University Circle, Turlock, CA 95382, USA.

We designed, manualised and evaluated PEGASUS (psychoeducation group for autism spectrum understanding and support), a group psychoeducational programme aiming to enhance the self-awareness of young people with ASD by teaching them about their diagnosis. This single-blind RCT (randomised control trial) involved 48 young people (9-14 years) with high-functioning ASD. Half were randomly assigned to PEGASUS, administered in six weekly group sessions, with the others receiving no additional intervention. ASD-related self-awareness, the primary outcome, was evaluated using the bespoke Autism Knowledge Quiz (AKQ). Secondary outcome measures included the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. All measures were collected during home visits and scored by researchers blind to group assignment. The trial is registered on ClinicalTrials (NCT01187940, http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) and was funded by the Baily Thomas Charitable Trust. Bootstrap multiple regression showed ASD knowledge (β = .29, p < .001, 95% CIs [0.13, 0.44]) and ASD self-awareness (β = .42, p = .001, 95% CIs [0.17, 0.67]), measured by number of ASD-related personal strengths and difficulties listed by participants, increased for those who attended PEGASUS (n = 24) compared with controls (n = 24).

25070512,10.1093/Brain/Awu178,Response inhibition and serotonin in autism: a functional MRI study using acute tryptophan depletion.,2014-09-01,"It has been suggested that the restricted, stereotyped and repetitive behaviours typically found in autism are underpinned by deficits of inhibitory control. The biological basis of this is unknown but may include differences in the modulatory role of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, which are implicated in the condition. However, this has never been tested directly. We therefore assessed the modifying role of serotonin on inhibitory brain function during a Go/No-Go task in 14 adults with autism and normal intelligence and 14 control subjects that did not differ in gender, age and intelligence. We undertook a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of acute tryptophan depletion using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Following sham, adults with autism relative to controls had reduced activation in key inhibitory regions of inferior frontal cortex and thalamus, but increased activation of caudate and cerebellum. However, brain activation was modulated in opposite ways by depletion in each group. Within autistic individuals depletion upregulated fronto-thalamic activations and downregulated striato-cerebellar activations toward control sham levels, completely 'normalizing' the fronto-cerebellar dysfunctions. The opposite pattern occurred in controls. Moreover, the severity of autism was related to the degree of differential modulation by depletion within frontal, striatal and thalamic regions. Our findings demonstrate that individuals with autism have abnormal inhibitory networks, and that serotonin has a differential, opposite, effect on them in adults with and without autism. Together these factors may partially explain the severity of autistic behaviours and/or provide a novel (tractable) treatment target.","Daly Eileen, Ecker Christine, Hallahan Brian, Deeley Quinton, Craig Michael, Murphy Clodagh, Johnston Patrick, Spain Debbie, Gillan Nicola, Gudbrandsen Maria, Brammer Michael, Giampietro Vincent, Lamar Melissa, Page Lisa, Toal Fiona, Schmitz Nicole, Cleare Anthony, Robertson Dene, Rubia Katya, Murphy Declan G M",Brain : a journal of neurology,"Adolescent, Adult, Autistic Disorder, Brain, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Neural Inhibition, Photic Stimulation, Reaction Time, Serotonin, Tryptophan, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25070512,"1 Sackler Institute of Translational Neurodevelopment, Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Science, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, UK eileen.daly@kcl.ac.uk.; 5 Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, Brighton, UK.; 9 Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, UK.; 4 Department of Psychiatry, University of Illinois at Chicago, USA.; 2 Department of Psychiatry, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland.; 6 Dementia Research Unit, Institute of Neurology, University College London, UK.; 8 Behavioural and Developmental Clinical Academic Group, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation.; 7 Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, UK.; 3 Department of Neuroimaging, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, UK.; 1 Sackler Institute of Translational Neurodevelopment, Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Science, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, UK."

At baseline, 85% of this community sample had significantly elevated stress, 48% were clinically depressed, and 41% had anxiety disorders. Using slopes-as-outcomes, mixed random effects models, both treatments led to significant reductions in stress, depression, and anxiety, and improved sleep and life satisfaction, with large effects in depression and anxiety. Mothers in Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction versus Positive Adult Development had greater improvements in anxiety, depression, sleep, and well-being. Mothers of children with autism spectrum disorder improved less in anxiety, but did not otherwise differ from their counterparts.

The therapy targeted parental behaviour, with no direct interaction between therapist and child. While nonsignificant group differences were found on ADOS-G score, significant group differences were found for both parent and child intermediate outcomes. This study aimed to better understand the mechanism by which the PACT treatment influenced changes in child behaviour though the targeted parent behaviour. Mediation analysis was used to assess the direct and indirect effects of treatment via parent behaviour on child behaviour and via child behaviour on ADOS-G score. Alternative mediation was explored to study whether the treatment effect acted as hypothesised or via another plausible pathway. Mediation models typically assume no unobserved confounding between mediator and outcome and no measurement error in the mediator. We show how to better exploit the information often available within a trial to begin to address these issues, examining scope for instrumental variable and measurement error models. Estimates of mediation changed substantially when account was taken of the confounder effects of the baseline value of the mediator and of measurement error. Our best estimates that accounted for both suggested that the treatment effect on the ADOS-G score was very substantially mediated by parent synchrony and child initiations. The results highlighted the value of repeated measurement of mediators during trials. The theoretical model underlying the PACT treatment was supported. However, the substantial fall-off in treatment effect highlighted both the need for additional data and for additional target behaviours for therapy.","Pickles Andrew, Harris Victoria, Green Jonathan, Aldred Catherine, McConachie Helen, Slonims Vicky, Le Couteur Ann, Hudry Kristelle, Charman Tony,  ","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","Adult, Autistic Disorder, Child, Preschool, Communication, Female, Humans, Male, Parent-Child Relations, Parents, Psychotherapy, Group, Research Design, Single-Blind Method, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25039961,"Department of Biostatistics, Institute of Psychiatry, Kings College London, London, UK."

We included placebo-controlled clinical trials and cohort studies comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. We also included the following types of post-licensure analyses: case-control studies, self-controlled case series, and multivariate risk factor analyses. We conducted an electronic search of PubMed from inception through August 2013, and reviewed Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices statements, vaccine package inserts, and previously published reviews to identify studies. Scientific Information Packets were requested from vaccine manufacturers. We reviewed the methodology of the 2011 Institute of Medicine (IOM) consensus report ""Adverse Effects of Vaccines: Evidence and Causality"" and accepted their findings. We augmented their work with new studies and additional vaccines. For studies not included in the IOM report, we abstracted data on the presence or absence of adverse health outcomes, characteristics of patients, study design, and vaccine description, including brand, potency, dosage, timing, and formulation, where available. We excluded formulations not used in the United States. The McHarm instrument was used to evaluate the quality of adverse events collection and reporting in each study. We were unable to pool results; we rated the overall strength of evidence (SOE) as high, moderate, low, or insufficient by using guidance suggested by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality for its Effective Health Care Program. A total of 20,478 titles were identified; after title, abstract, and full-text review, 166 studies were accepted for abstraction. The vast majority of studies either did not investigate or could not identify risk factors for adverse events (AEs) associated with vaccination. Similarly, the severity of AEs was inconsistently reported, as was information that would make independent severity determination possible. SOE was high for the following associations in nonpregnant adults: seasonal influenza vaccine and arthralgia, myalgia, malaise, fever, pain at injection site; 2009 monovalent H1N1 vaccine and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS); and a lack of association between influenza and pneumococcal vaccines and cardiovascular events in the elderly. Risk of GBS was estimated at 1.6 excess cases per million persons vaccinated. SOE was high for the following associations in children and adolescents: measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and febrile seizures in children under age 5; lack of association between MMR vaccine and autism spectrum disorders; and varicella vaccine and disseminated Oka strain varicella zoster virus with associated complications (i.e., meningitis, encephalitis) in individuals with demonstrated immunodeficiencies. There is moderate SOE that vaccines against rotavirus are associated with intussusception in children; risk was estimated as 1 to 5 cases per 100,000 vaccine doses, depending on brand. Moderate-strength evidence exists regarding human papillomavirus vaccine and a lack of association with onset of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and GBS. Moderate-strength evidence shows no association between inactivated influenza vaccine and serious AEs in pregnant women. Evidence was insufficient to make conclusions regarding whether several routinely recommended vaccines are associated with serious conditions such as multiple sclerosis, transverse myelitis, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. There is evidence that some vaccines are associated with serious adverse events; however, these events are extremely rare and must be weighed against the protective benefits that vaccines provide. Careful consideration should be given to the investigation of research gaps, including patient risk factors that may be associated with AEs; however, important factors must be taken into account when determining whether studies are warranted, including the severity and frequency of the AE being studied and the challenges of conducting sufficiently powered studies when investigating rare events.","Maglione Margaret A, Gidengil Courtney, Das Lopamudra, Raaen Laura, Smith Alexandria, Chari Ramya, Newberry Sydne, Hempel Susanne, Shanman Roberta, Perry Tanja, Goetz Matthew Bidwell",Evidence report/technology assessment,"Vaccines, Immunization, United States, Humans, Child, Adolescent, Young Adult, Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30257278,Southern California Evidence-based Practice Center.

A total of 61 minimally verbal children with autism, aged 5 to 8 years, were randomized to a blended developmental/behavioral intervention (JASP+EMT) with or without the augmentation of a SGD for 6 months with a 3-month follow-up. The intervention consisted of 2 stages. In stage 1, all children received 2 sessions per week for 3 months. Stage 2 intervention was adapted (by increased sessions or adding the SGD) based on the child's early response. The primary outcome was the total number of spontaneous communicative utterances; secondary measures were the total number of novel words and total comments from a natural language sample. Primary aim results found improvements in spontaneous communicative utterances, novel words, and comments that all favored the blended behavioral intervention that began by including an SGD (JASP+EMT+SGD) as opposed to spoken words alone (JASP+EMT). Secondary aim results suggest that the adaptive intervention beginning with JASP+EMT+SGD and intensifying JASP+EMT+SGD for children who were slow responders led to better posttreatment outcomes. Minimally verbal school-aged children can make significant and rapid gains in spoken spontaneous language with a novel, blended intervention that focuses on joint engagement and play skills and incorporates an SGD.

Thirteen children with ASD (7-11 years old) were randomly assigned to 32 sessions of CBT or community-based psychosocial treatment (TAU) for 16 weeks. The CBT program is based on the memory retrieval competition model and emphasizes the development of perspective-taking through guided behavioral experimentation supplemented with reflective Socratic discussion and supported by parent training and school consultation to promote generalization of social communication and emotion regulation skills. Trained observers blind to treatment condition observed each child during recess on two separate days at baseline and again at posttreatment, using a structured behavioral observation system that generates frequency scores for observed social communication-related autism symptoms. CBT outperformed TAU at posttreatment on the frequency of self-isolation, the proportion of time spent with peers, the frequency of positive or appropriate interaction with peers, and the frequency of positive or appropriate peer responses to the target child (d effect size range 1.34-1.62). On average, children in CBT were engaged in positive or appropriate social interaction with peers in 68.6% of observed intervals at posttreatment, compared to 25% of intervals for children in TAU.

A Web-based nationally representative 2-wave survey experiment was conducted with 1759 parents age 18 years and older residing in the United States who have children in their household age 17 years or younger (conducted June-July 2011). Parents were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 4 interventions: (1) information explaining the lack of evidence that MMR causes autism from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; (2) textual information about the dangers of the diseases prevented by MMR from the Vaccine Information Statement; (3) images of children who have diseases prevented by the MMR vaccine; (4) a dramatic narrative about an infant who almost died of measles from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention fact sheet; or to a control group. None of the interventions increased parental intent to vaccinate a future child. Refuting claims of an MMR/autism link successfully reduced misperceptions that vaccines cause autism but nonetheless decreased intent to vaccinate among parents who had the least favorable vaccine attitudes. In addition, images of sick children increased expressed belief in a vaccine/autism link and a dramatic narrative about an infant in danger increased self-reported belief in serious vaccine side effects. Current public health communications about vaccines may not be effective. For some parents, they may actually increase misperceptions or reduce vaccination intention. Attempts to increase concerns about communicable diseases or correct false claims about vaccines may be especially likely to be counterproductive.

ASD families received more hours of conventional services compared with DD families (17.8 vs 11; p < .001). The use of psychotropic medications was low in both groups (approximately 3%). Overall, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use was not significantly different in ASD (39%) versus DD (30%). Hispanic families in both groups used CAM less often than non-Hispanic families.

Families who used >20 hours per week of conventional services were more likely to use CAM, including potentially unsafe or disproven CAM. Underimmunized children were marginally more likely to use CAM but not more likely to have received potentially unsafe or disproven CAM.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe and efficacious technique when targeting specific areas of cortical dysfunction in major depressive disorder, and a similar approach could yield therapeutic benefits in ASD, if applied to relevant cortical regions. The aim of this study was to examine whether deep rTMS to bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex improves social relating in ASD. 28 adults diagnosed with either autistic disorder (high-functioning) or Asperger's disorder completed a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design with 2 weeks of daily weekday treatment. This involved deep rTMS to bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (5 Hz, 10-s train duration, 20-s inter-train interval) for 15 min (1500 pulses per session) using a HAUT-Coil. The sham rTMS coil was encased in the same helmet of the active deep rTMS coil, but no effective field was delivered into the brain. Assessments were conducted before, after, and one month following treatment. Participants in the active condition showed a near significant reduction in self-reported social relating symptoms from pre-treatment to one month follow-up, and a significant reduction in social relating symptoms (relative to sham participants) for both post-treatment assessments. Those in the active condition also showed a reduction in self-oriented anxiety during difficult and emotional social situations from pre-treatment to one month follow-up. There were no changes for those in the sham condition. Deep rTMS to bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex yielded a reduction in social relating impairment and socially-related anxiety.

Family-centred music therapy (FCMT) endeavours to support social engagement between child and parent within active music-making, yet the extent of benefits provided is unknown. This study investigated the impacts of FCMT on social engagement abilities. Twenty-three children (36-60 months) with severe ASD received either 16 weeks of FCMT in addition to their early intervention programmes (n = 12), or their early intervention programme only (n = 11). Change in social engagement was measured with standardized parent-report assessments, parent interviews and clinician observation. Intention-to-treat analysis for the Vineland Social Emotional Early Childhood Scale indicated a significant effect in favour of FCMT. Thematic qualitative analysis of the parent interviews showed that the parent-child relationship grew stronger.

Students were matched for gender, age, race, IQ, ASD symptomotolgy, medication status, and parents' education. Interventions were matched for 'dose' of intervention and training. Measures of pre-post change included classroom observations, parent/teacher report, and direct child measures of problem-solving, EF, and social skills. Schools were randomized and evaluators, but not parents or teachers, were blinded to intervention type. Interventions were administered with high fidelity. Children in both groups improved with intervention, but mean change scores from pre- to postintervention indicated significantly greater improvements for UOT than SS groups in: problem-solving, flexibility, and planning/organizing. Also, classroom observations revealed that participants in UOT made greater improvements than SS participants in their ability to follow rules, make transitions, and be flexible. Children in both groups made equivalent improvements in social skills. These data support the effectiveness of the first contextually-based EF intervention for children with ASD. UOT improved classroom behavior, flexibility, and problem-solving in children with ASD.

To investigate whether a brief cognitive behavioral intervention, problem-solving education (PSE), decreases parenting stress and maternal depressive symptoms during the period immediately following a child's diagnosis of ASD. A randomized clinical trial compared 6 sessions of PSE with usual care. Settings included an autism clinic and 6 community-based early intervention programs that primarily serve low-income families. Participants were mothers of 122 young children (mean age, 34 months) who recently received a diagnosis of ASD. Among mothers assessed for eligibility, 17.0% declined participation. We report outcomes after 3 months of follow-up (immediate postdiagnosis period). Problem-solving education is a brief, cognitive intervention delivered in six 30-minute individualized sessions by existing staff (early intervention programs) or research staff without formal mental health training (autism clinic). Primary outcomes were parental stress and maternal depressive symptoms. Fifty-nine mothers were randomized to receive PSE and 63 to receive usual care. The follow-up rate was 91.0%. Most intervention mothers (78.0%) received the full PSE course. At the 3-month follow-up assessment, PSE mothers were significantly less likely than those serving as controls to have clinically significant parental stress (3.8% vs 29.3%; adjusted relative risk [aRR], 0.17; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.65). For depressive symptoms, the risk reduction in clinically significant symptoms did not reach statistical significance (5.7% vs 22.4%; aRR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.10 to 1.08); however, the reduction in mean depressive symptoms was statistically significant (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology score, 4.6 with PSE vs 6.9 with usual care; adjusted mean difference, -1.67; 95% CI, -3.17 to -0.18). The positive effects of PSE in reducing parenting stress and depressive symptoms during the critical postdiagnosis period, when parents are asked to navigate a complex service delivery system, suggest that it may have a place in clinical practice.

Behavioral intervention represents an effective treatment for chronic feeding concerns in this population; however, evidence has largely been established with trained therapists working in highly structured settings. This pilot study seeks to fill this gap in the literature by describing and evaluating the Autism MEAL Plan, a behaviorally based parent-training curriculum to address feeding problems associated with autism spectrum disorders. We assessed the feasibility of the intervention in terms of program content and study protocol (e.g. recruitment and retention of participants, assessment procedures), as well as efficacy in terms of changes in feeding behaviors. A total of 10 families participated in the treatment condition, and the program was evaluated using a waitlist control design (n = 9), representing the first randomized-control study of a feeding intervention in autism spectrum disorders.

In this paper, we summarize the results of this Italian-Israeli consensus conference. ASDs constitute a class of severe and heterogeneous neurodevelopmental conditions caused by atypical brain development beginning during early prenatal life, reflecting many genetic, neurobiological and environmental influences. The first clinical signs of ASDs begin to be evident in children between 12 and 18 months of age, often after a period of relatively typical postnatal development. Recent longitudinal studies reveal substantial diversity in developmental trajectories through childhood and adolescence. Some intervention approaches have been demonstrated to be effective in improving core symptoms of ASDs, even if the heterogeneity and developmental nature of the disorder make it implausible that only one specific treatment will be best for all children with ASDs. More randomized control trials (RCTs) on early intervention are needed to identify the most effective strategies and provide the most efficient allocation of resources during the critical early intervention time period. Future research should focus on linking biological phenotypes with specific genotypes, thus establishing a foundation for the development of diagnostic screening tools and individualization of treatments.","Zachor Ditza A, Curatolo Paolo,  ",European journal of paediatric neurology : EJPN : official journal of the European Paediatric Neurology Society,"Adolescent, Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Early Diagnosis, Female, Humans, Israel, Italy, Male",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24095105,"Department of Pediatrics, The Autism Center, Assaf Harofe Medical Center, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.; Department of Neuroscience, Pediatric Neurology Unit, Tor Vergata University of Rome, Tor Vergata University, via Montpellier 1, 00133 Rome, Italy.

Biologic hypotheses suggest that an overly rapid brain growth leads to the core symptoms of ASD by impairing connectivity. Literature is divided however where deleterious, protective and null associations of HC with ASD symptoms in individuals with ASD have been found. Individuals (n = 1,416) from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange with ASD were examined for associations of HC with ASD like symptoms. Mixed models controlling for sex, age, race/ethnicity, simplex/multiplex status and accounting for correlations between siblings were used. Interactions by simplex/multiplex were explored. Adjustments for height in a sub-population with available data were explored as well. A Significant interaction term (p = 0.03) suggested that the effect of HC was dependent on whether the individual was simplex or multiplex. In simplex individuals at mean age (8.9 years) 1 cm increase in head circumference was associated with a 24% increase in the odds of a high social diagnostic score from the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (odds ratio  = 1.24, p = 0.01). There was no association in multiplex individuals. Additionally, individuals classified with a non-verbal IQ <70 were 90% simplex and had a significantly increased head circumference (0.7 cm p = 0.03) relative to a mid-range non-verbal IQ group. Interestingly, children classified with a >110 non-verbal IQ also had an increased HC (0.4 cm p = 0.04), relative to a mid-range non-verbal IQ group, and were 90% multiplex. HC effects do not appear to be confounded by height, however, larger samples with height information are needed. The potential link between brain growth and autism like symptoms is complex and could depend on specific etiologies. Further investigations accounting for a likely mode of inheritance will help identify an ASD subtype related to HC.","Davis Jonathan M, Keeney Jonathon G, Sikela James M, Hepburn Susan",PloS one,"Adolescent, Adult, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Cross-Sectional Studies, Female, Head, Humans, Infant, Male, Models, Genetic, Organ Size",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24058641,"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics & Human Medical Genetics & Neuroscience Programs, University of Colorado Denver Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado, United States of America."

We also searched the reference lists of published papers. Randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing treatment (social skills groups) with a control group who were not receiving the treatment for participants aged six to 21 years with ASD. The control group could be no intervention, wait list, or treatment as usual. Outcomes sought were standardized measures of social competence, social communication, quality of life, emotion recognition, and any other specific behaviors. Two review authors independently selected and appraised studies for inclusion and assessed the risk of bias in each included study. All outcome data were continuous and standardized mean difference effect sizes (ES) with small sample correction were calculated. We conducted random-effects meta-analysis where possible. We included five RCTs evaluating the effects of social skills groups in 196 participants with ASD aged 6 to 21 years old. The results show there is some evidence that social skills groups improve overall social competence (ES = 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.78, P = 0.003) and friendship quality (ES = 0.41, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.81, P = 0.04) for this population. No differences were found between treatment and control groups in relation to emotional recognition (ES = 0.34, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.88, P = 0.21) assessed in two studies or social communication as related to the understanding of idioms (ES = 0.05, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.72, P = 0.89), which was assessed in only one study. Two additional quality of life outcomes were evaluated, with results of single studies suggesting decreases in loneliness (ES = -0.66, 95% CI -1.15 to -0.17) but no effect on child or parental depression. No adverse events were reported. Given the nature of the intervention and the selected outcome measures, the risk of performance and detection bias are high. There is limited generalizability from the studies as they were all conducted in the US; they focused mainly on children aged 7 to 12, and the participants were all of average or above average intelligence. There is some evidence that social skills groups can improve social competence for some children and adolescents with ASD. More research is needed to draw more robust conclusions, especially with respect to improvements in quality of life.","Reichow Brian, Steiner Amanda M, Volkmar Fred",Evidence-based child health : a Cochrane review journal,"Adolescent, Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Emotions, Evidence-Based Medicine, Humans, Interpersonal Relations, Psychotherapy, Group, Quality of Life, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Social Behavior, Treatment Outcome, United States, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23877884,"Child Study Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA. brian.reichow@yale.edu"

The present study aims to compare the effect of a traditional Chinese Chan-based mind-body exercise, Nei Yang Gong, with that of the conventional Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) technique in enhancing the self-control of children with ASD. Forty-six age- and IQ-matched ASD children were randomly assigned to receive group training in Nei Yang Gong (experimental group) or PMR (control group) twice per week for four weeks. The participants' self-control was measured by three neuropsychological tests and parental rating on standardized questionnaires, and the underlying neural mechanism was assessed by the participants' brain EEG activity during an inhibitory-control task before and after intervention. The results show that the experimental group demonstrated significantly greater improvement in self-control than the control group, which concurs with the parental reports of reduced autistic symptoms and increased control of temper and behaviors. In addition, the experimental group showed enhanced EEG activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, a region that mediates self-control, whereas the PMR group did not. The present findings support the potential application of Chinese Chan-based mind-body exercises as a form of neuropsychological rehabilitation for patients with self-control problems.

Children with DD are also at high risk for exhibiting significant behaviour problems. Parental stress has been shown to impact the development of these behaviour problems; however, it is rarely addressed in interventions aimed at reducing child behaviour problems. The current study examined the efficacy of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) for parents of children with DD by investigating whether this intervention is effective in reducing parenting stress and whether decreases in parenting stress lead to reductions in behaviour problems among children with DD. Forty six parents of children with DD were randomly assigned to an immediate treatment or wait list-control group. Participants completed questionnaires assessing parental stress and child behaviour problems at intake and at a second assessment, which took place after only the immediate treatment group had received the MBSR. Parents who participated in MBSR reported significantly less stress and depression as well as greater life satisfaction compared with wait list-control parents. Regarding child outcomes, children whose parents participated in MBSR were reported to have fewer behaviour problems following the intervention, specifically in the areas of attention problems and ADHD symptomatology. Results indicated that MBSR may be an effective intervention for ameliorating parental stress and mental health problems among parents of children with DD. Additionally, these benefits may 'spill over' and improve behaviour challenges among these children.",Neece Cameron L,Journal of applied research in intellectual disabilities : JARID,"Adaptation, Psychological, Adult, Child Behavior Disorders, Child, Preschool, Developmental Disabilities, Female, Humans, Male, Mindfulness, Parenting, Parents, Stress, Psychological, Surveys and Questionnaires, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23813562,"Department of Psychology, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA, USA."

It is classified as a type of pervasive developmental disorder (PDD). All PDDs have a qualitative impairment in social relatedness. However, many individuals with PDDs have interfering symptoms, including irritability (aggression, self-injurious behavior, and severe tantrums). Behavioral therapy is often helpful in decreasing these behaviors; however, sometimes adjunctive medications are needed, because of the intensity and severity of irritability. Numerous medications have been tested on patients with PDDs. Although many of these medications have been demonstrated to be useful, no clear main treatment for PDD has emerged. Despite the efficacy of some of the medicines, acceptability and side effects have proven to be barriers to their use. Yokukansan (TJ-54), a traditional Japanese medicine, is composed of seven kinds of dried herbs. It is widely prescribed in clinical situations for treating psychiatric disorders by acting mainly on the glutamatergic and serotonergic nervous system. Recent studies indicate that TJ-54 may be safe and useful in treating behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia patients. We aimed at evaluating both the efficacy and the safety of TJ-54 in patients with PDDs. This was a 12 week prospective, open-label investigation of TJ-54 in 20 children and adolescents ages 6-17 years diagnosed with PDDs. Primary outcome measures included the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement of Illness Scale (CGI-I), Children's Global Assessment Score (CGAS), and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) irritability subscale. Twenty subjects, ages 6-17 years, received TJ-54 in the dosage range of 2.5-7.5 g/day. The CGI-I was significantly improved from 8 weeks (p<0.001). The mean CGAS was 31.92 at baseline, whereas the mean final score at 12 weeks was 54.52 (p<0.001). The ABC irritability/agitation subscale (subscale 1) was significantly improved from 8 weeks, and the hyperactivity/noncompliance subscale (subscale 4) was significantly improved in 12 weeks. TJ-54 was well tolerated. No subject left the study because of a drug-related adverse event. These preliminary data suggest that TJ-54 may be effective and well tolerated for the treatment of severe irritability/agitation and hyperactivity/noncompliance in children and adolescents ages 6-17 years with PDD. However, given the characteristics of this trial, the present findings should be taken cautiously, and larger-scale placebo-controlled studies are needed to elucidate the efficacy and tolerability of TJ-54 in this understudied population.","Wake Rei, Miyaoka Tsuyoshi, Inagaki Takuji, Furuya Motohide, Ieda Masa, Liaury Kristian, Kishi Kazuko, Horiguchi Jun",Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology,"Adolescent, Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Drugs, Chinese Herbal, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Irritable Mood, Male, Pilot Projects, Prospective Studies, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Severity of Illness Index, Time Factors, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23782127,"Department of Psychiatry, Shimane University Faculty of Medicine, Izumo, Shimane, Japan. rei@med.shimane-u.ac.jp"

One-hundred female domestic fowl were divided into five groups and hens in immunised groups were primed and subsequently boosted with either JOL919 or a JOL919-JOL1228 mixture. Humoral and cellular immune responses were significantly higher in the immunised groups than the control group. On challenge with virulent SE, egg protection was 89.3% in immunised hens in group B (primed and boosted twice with JOL919 only), 89.3% in group C (primed with JOL919-JOL1228 mixture and boosted twice with JOL919), 100% in group D (primed and first booster with JOL919-JOL1228 mixture, then subsequently boosted with JOL919), 90.5% in group E (primed and boosted twice with JOL919-JOL1228 mixture) and 60.7% in group A (control group of non-immunised hens inoculated with phosphate buffered saline). The challenge strain was detected significantly less in all organs examined from hens in group D than those of the control group.

The present study added to this literature by having parents reinforce spontaneous requests functionally equivalent to problem behavior in their children with autism at home. First, parent-implemented functional analyses identified conditions associated with increased problem behavior and requests in two children with autism. Then, parents provided the maintaining reinforcer contingent on problem behavior alone or both problem behavior and requests in a withdrawal design. The treatment analysis indicated that the same reinforcer maintained child requests and problem behavior. In addition, when parents reinforced both requests and problem behavior, child participants demonstrated a preference for requests, thereby decreasing problem behavior.

Therapist homework-related behaviors were coded from audiotapes of Sessions 1 and 2 and used to predict adolescents' homework adherence, coded from audiotapes of Sessions 2 and 3. Several therapist behaviors were predictive of subsequent homework adherence, particularly for initially resistant or nonadherent adolescents. Stronger homework rationale and greater time allocated to explaining homework in Session 1 predicted greater adherence at Session 2, particularly for initially resistant adolescents. Stronger rationale and eliciting reactions/troubleshooting obstacles in Session 2 predicted greater adherence at Session 3, particularly for adolescents who were less adherent to prior homework. Strategies such as providing a strong rationale, allocating more time to assigning homework, and eliciting reactions/troubleshooting obstacles may be effective ways to bolster homework adherence among initially less engaged, depressed teens.","Jungbluth Nathaniel J, Shirk Stephen R","Journal of clinical child and adolescent psychology : the official journal for the Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, American Psychological Association, Division 53","Achievement, Adolescent, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Depressive Disorder, Female, Humans, Male, Professional-Patient Relations, Prospective Studies, Students, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23237021,"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Medicine, Seattle Children's Hospital, 4800 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98105, USA.

This study had two phases: in the first phase, preference assessments and reinforcer assessments were conducted to identify the most highly preferred items and relative preferred type of reinforcers. In the second phase, teachers taught the target skills using two different reinforcers and the three dependent variables were compared between two reinforcer conditions. The results suggest that the reinforcers were equally effective; however tangible reinforcers resulted in high levels of stereotyped behavior. The results indicate that social reinforcers can be efficient reinforcers for the population.

Although many of these medications have been demonstrated to be useful, no clear primary treatment for PDD-NOS and Asperger's disorder has emerged. Despite the efficacy of some of the medicines, the acceptability and side effects have proven to be barriers to their use. Recent studies indicate that the traditional Japanese herbal medicine yokukansan (TJ-54) may be safe and useful in treating behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia and some neuropsychiatric disorders. We aimed at evaluating both the efficacy and safety of TJ-54 in patients with well-defined PDD-NOS and Asperger's disorder. This was a 12-week prospective, open-label investigation of TJ-54 in 40 children, adolescents, and adults diagnosed with PDD-NOS or Asperger's disorder. Primary outcome measures included the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness Scale (CGI-S) and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Iritability subscale score (ABC-I). Forty subjects, ages 8-40 years (mean 22.7 ± 7.3 years) received a mean final TJ-54 dosage of 6.4 ± 1.3 g/day (range 2.5-7.5 g/day). Full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ) scores ranged from 70 to 110 (mean 88.9 ± 13.2). Thirty-six (90%) of 40 subjects showed fewer interfering symptoms of irritability, including aggression, self-injury, and tantrums, with a final CGI-S of 1 or 2 (normal, not at all ill or borderline mentally ill) and a 80% or greater improvement on the ABC-I. The mean CGI-S score at baseline was 6.8 ± 0.8 whereas scores at end point was 1.9 ± 0.1 (< 0.0001). ABC-I scores ranged from 11 to 29 (mean 17.4 ± 3.66) at baseline, whereas scores at week 12 ranged from 0 to 5 (mean 0.93 ± 0.97) (p <0.0001). TJ-54 was well tolerated. No subject exited the study due to a drug-related adverse event. These preliminary data suggest that TJ-54 may be effective and well tolerated for treatment of severe irritability, lethargy/withdrawal, stereotypic behavior, hyperactivity/noncompliance, and inappropriate speech in patients with PDD-NOS or Asperger's disorder. However, given the characteristics of this trial, the present findings should be taken cautiously, and larger-scale placebo-controlled studies are needed to elucidate the efficacy and tolerability of TJ-54 in this understudied population.","Miyaoka Tsuyoshi, Wake Rei, Furuya Motohide, Liaury Kristian, Ieda Masa, Kawakami Kazunori, Tsuchie Keiko, Inagaki Takuji, Horiguchi Jun",BMC psychiatry,"Adolescent, Adult, Asperger Syndrome, Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Drugs, Chinese Herbal, Female, Humans, Male, Pilot Projects, Prospective Studies, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Severity of Illness Index, Time Factors, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23194148,"Department of Psychiatry, Shimane University School of Medicine, 89-1 Enyacho, Izumo 693-8501, Japan. miyanyan@med.shimane-u.ac.j"

The main goal of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a short theory of mind intervention for children with ASD. A second objective is to determine which subgroups within the autism spectrum profit most from the intervention. This study is a randomized controlled trial. One hundred children with ASD, aged 7 to 12 years will be randomly assigned to an intervention or a waiting list control group. Outcome measures include the completion of theory of mind and emotion understanding tasks, and parent and teacher questionnaires on children's social skills.

A live adjuvant Salmonella Gallinarum (SG) strain was generated in the present study to facilitate efficacious oral vaccination with this vaccine. The Escherichia coli eltB gene secreting heat-labile enterotoxin B subunit (LTB) was cloned into an Asd(+) plasmid pJHL65. This was transformed into a Δlon ΔcpxR Δasd SG strain and the resulting strain was designated JOL1229. Secretion of LTB from JOL1229 was confirmed with an immunoblot assay. To determine the optimal dose of the strain, 50 six-week-old female chickens were divided into five groups (Groups A-E, n=10 per group) and orally inoculated with various doses of JOL1229 and JOL916. In Group B (consisting of four parts JOL916 and one part JOL1229), significant cell-mediated immune responses, plasma IgG levels and intestinal secretary IgA levels were induced after inoculation with both strains. On challenge with the wild-type strain, significant reductions in mortality were observed in the group. In addition, after inoculation the LTB strain was not recovered in feces samples, and resulted in no, or very mild, gross lesions in the liver and spleen. Both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells were significantly increased in peripheral blood samples from the chickens immunized with the LTB strain. Expression of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene in splenocytes was induced in the chickens immunized with the LTB strain. These results suggest that oral immunization with the LTB-adjuvant strain, in particular with the four parts JOL916 and one part JOL1229 mixture, increased the immune response and provided efficient protection against FT in chickens.","Jeon Byung Woo, Jawale Chetan V, Kim Seung Hwan, Lee John Hwa",Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,"Administration, Oral, Animals, Bacterial Toxins, Bacterial Vaccines, Chickens, Enterotoxins, Escherichia coli Proteins, Feces, Female, Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial, Interleukin-6, Plasmids, Poultry Diseases, RNA, Messenger, Salmonella, Salmonella Infections, Animal",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23083937,"College of Veterinary Medicine, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju 561-756, Republic of Korea."
23076956,10.1002/14651858.Cd009260.Pub2,Early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) for young children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD).,2012-10-17,"The rising prevalence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) increases the need for evidence-based behavioral treatments to lessen the impact of symptoms on children's functioning. At present, there are no curative or psychopharmacological therapies to effectively treat all symptoms of the disorder. Early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI), a treatment based on the principles of applied behavior analysis delivered for multiple years at an intensity of 20 to 40 hours per week, is one of the more well-established treatments for ASD. To systematically review the evidence for the effectiveness of EIBI in increasing the functional behaviors and skills of young children with ASD. We searched the following databases on 22 November 2011: CENTRAL (2011 Issue 4), MEDLINE (1948 to November Week 2, 2011), EMBASE (1980 to Week 46, 2011), PsycINFO (1806 to November Week 3, 2011), CINAHL (1937 to current), ERIC (1966 to current), Sociological Abstracts (1952 to current), Social Science Citation Index (1970 to current), WorldCat, metaRegister of Controlled Trials, and Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations. We also searched the reference lists of published papers. Randomized control trials (RCTs), quasi-randomized control trials, or clinical control trials (CCTs) in which EIBI was compared to a no-treatment or treatment-as-usual control condition. Participants must have been less than six years of age at treatment onset and assigned to their study condition prior to commencing treatment. Two authors independently selected and appraised studies for inclusion and assessed the risk of bias in each included study. All outcome data were continuous, from which standardized mean difference effect sizes with small sample correction were calculated. We conducted random-effects meta-analysis where possible, which means we assumed individual studies would provide different estimates of treatment effects. One RCT and four CCTs with a total of 203 participants were included. Reliance on synthesis from four CCTs limits the evidential base and this should be borne in mind when interpreting the results. All studies used a treatment-as-usual comparison group. We synthesized the results of the four CCTs using a random-effects model of meta-analysis of the standardized mean differences. Positive effects in favor of the EIBI treatment group were found for all outcomes. The mean effect size for adaptive behavior was g = 0.69 (95% CI 0.38 to 1.01; P < 0.0001). The mean effect size for IQ was g = 0.76 (95% CI 0.40 to 1.11; P < 0.0001). Three measures of communication and language skills all showed results in favor of EIBI: expressive language g = 0.50 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.95; P = 0.03), receptive language g = 0.57 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.94; P = .03), and daily communication skills g = 0.74 (95% CI 0.30 to 1.18; P = 0.0009). The mean effect size for socialization was g = 0.42 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.73; P = 0.0008), and for daily living skills was g = 0.55 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.87; P = 0.0005). Additional descriptive analyses of other aspects related to quality of life and psychopathology are presented. However, due to the inclusion of non-randomized studies, there is a high risk of bias and the overall quality of evidence was rated as 'low' using the GRADE system, which rates the quality of evidence from meta-analyses to determine recommendations for practice. There is some evidence that EIBI is an effective behavioral treatment for some children with ASD. However, the current state of the evidence is limited because of the reliance on data from non-randomized studies (CCTs) due to the lack of RCTs. Additional studies using RCT research designs are needed to make stronger conclusions about the effects of EIBI for children with ASD.","Reichow Brian, Barton Erin E, Boyd Brian A, Hume Kara",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Behavior Therapy, Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic, Early Intervention, Educational, Early Medical Intervention, Humans",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23076956,"Child Study Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA. brian.reichow@yale.edu."

A randomized controlled trial involving 98 children and families was carried out in three different sites investigating the efficacy of a parent delivery of the Early Start Denver model (P-ESDM), which fosters parental use of a child-centered responsive interaction style that embeds many teaching opportunities into play, compared to community treatment as usual. Assessments were completed at baseline and 12 weeks later, immediately after the end of parent coaching sessions. There was no effect of group assignment on parent-child interaction characteristics or on any child outcomes. Both groups of parents improved interaction skills, and both groups of children demonstrated progress. Parents receiving P-ESDM demonstrated significantly stronger working alliances with their therapists than did the community group. Children in the community group received significantly more intervention hours than those in the P-ESDM group. For the group as a whole, both younger child age at the start of intervention and a greater number of intervention hours were positively related to the degree of improvement in children's behavior for most variables. Parent-implemented intervention studies for early ASD thus far have not demonstrated the large effects seen in intensive-treatment studies. Evidence that both younger age and more intervention hours positively affect developmental rates has implications for clinical practice, service delivery, and public policy.","Rogers Sally J, Estes Annette, Lord Catherine, Vismara Laurie, Winter Jamie, Fitzpatrick Annette, Guo Mengye, Dawson Geraldine",Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,"Adult, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Child, Preschool, Early Intervention, Educational, Family Therapy, Female, Humans, Infant, Male, Models, Psychological, Parent-Child Relations, Parents, Risk, Time Factors",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23021480,"University of California-Davis (UC Davis) Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders Institute, Sacramento 95817, USA. sally.rogers@ucdmc.ucdavis.edu"

While pharmacologic interventions have shown promise for enhancing empathic accuracy, little is known about the effects of behavioral interventions on empathic accuracy and related brain activity. This study employed a randomized, controlled and longitudinal design to investigate the effect of a secularized analytical compassion meditation program, cognitive-based compassion training (CBCT), on empathic accuracy. Twenty-one healthy participants received functional MRI scans while completing an empathic accuracy task, the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), both prior to and after completion of either CBCT or a health discussion control group. Upon completion of the study interventions, participants randomized to CBCT and were significantly more likely than control subjects to have increased scores on the RMET and increased neural activity in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Moreover, changes in dmPFC and IFG activity from baseline to the post-intervention assessment were associated with changes in empathic accuracy.

A randomized controlled trial.,2013-03-01,"EEG-biofeedback has been reported to reduce symptoms of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in several studies. However, these studies did not control for nonspecific effects of EEG-biofeedback and did not distinguish between participants who succeeded in influencing their own EEG activity and participants who did not. To overcome these methodological shortcomings, this study evaluated the effects of EEG-biofeedback in ASD in a randomized pretest-posttest control group design with blinded active comparator and six months follow-up. Thirty-eight participants were randomly allocated to the EEG-biofeedback, skin conductance (SC)-biofeedback or waiting list group. EEG- and SC-biofeedback sessions were similar and participants were blinded to the type of feedback they received. Assessments pre-treatment, post-treatment, and after 6 months included parent ratings of symptoms of ASD, executive function tasks, and 19-channel EEG recordings. Fifty-four percent of the participants significantly reduced delta and/or theta power during EEG-biofeedback sessions and were identified as EEG-regulators. In these EEG-regulators, no statistically significant reductions of symptoms of ASD were observed, but they showed significant improvement in cognitive flexibility as compared to participants who managed to regulate SC. EEG-biofeedback seems to be an applicable tool to regulate EEG activity and has specific effects on cognitive flexibility, but it did not result in significant reductions in symptoms of ASD. An important finding was that no nonspecific effects of EEG-biofeedback were demonstrated.","Kouijzer Mirjam E J, van Schie Hein T, Gerrits Berrie J L, Buitelaar Jan K, de Moor Jan M H",Applied psychophysiology and biofeedback,"Adolescent, Brain, Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Female, Galvanic Skin Response, Humans, Male, Neurofeedback, Trail Making Test, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22903518,"Behavioural Science Institute, Radboud University Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. mirjamkouijzer@gmail.com"

We also searched the reference lists of published papers. Randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing treatment (social skills groups) with a control group who were not receiving the treatment for participants aged six to 21 years with ASD. The control group could be no intervention, wait list, or treatment as usual. Outcomes sought were standardized measures of social competence, social communication, quality of life, emotion recognition, and any other specific behaviors. Two review authors independently selected and appraised studies for inclusion and assessed the risk of bias in each included study. All outcome data were continuous and standardized mean difference effect sizes (ES) with small sample correction were calculated. We conducted random-effects meta-analysis where possible. We included five RCTs evaluating the effects of social skills groups in 196 participants with ASD aged 6 to 21 years old. The results show there is some evidence that social skills groups improve overall social competence (ES = 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.78, P = 0.003) and friendship quality (ES = 0.41, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.81, P = 0.04) for this population.

Two additional quality of life outcomes were evaluated, with results of single studies suggesting decreases in loneliness (ES = -0.66, 95% CI -1.15 to -0.17) but no effect on child or parental depression. No adverse events were reported.Given the nature of the intervention and the selected outcome measures, the risk of performance and detection bias are high. There is limited generalizability from the studies as they were all conducted in the US; they focused mainly on children aged 7 to 12, and the participants were all of average or above average intelligence.

The biological basis to this is incompletely understood, but it may include differences in the role of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, which modulate facial emotion processing in health. While some individuals with ASD have significant differences in the serotonin system, to our knowledge, no one has investigated its role during facial emotion processing in adults with ASD and control subjects using acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) and functional magnetic resonance imaging. To compare the effects of ATD on brain responses to primary facial expressions of emotion in men with ASD and healthy control subjects.

Fourteen men of normal intelligence with autism and 14 control subjects who did not significantly differ in sex, age, or overall intelligence. Blood oxygenation level-dependent response to facial expressions of emotion. Brain activation was differentially modulated by ATD depending on diagnostic group and emotion type within regions of the social brain network. For example, processing of disgust faces was associated with interactions in medial frontal and lingual gyri, whereas processing of happy faces was associated with interactions in middle frontal gyrus and putamen. Modulation of the processing of facial expressions of emotion by serotonin significantly differs in people with ASD compared with control subjects. The differences vary with emotion type and occur in social brain regions that have been shown to be associated with group differences in serotonin synthesis/receptor or transporter density.","Daly Eileen M, Deeley Quinton, Ecker Christine, Craig Michael, Hallahan Brian, Murphy Clodagh, Johnston Patrick, Spain Debbie, Gillan Nicola, Brammer Michael, Giampietro Vincent, Lamar Melissa, Page Lisa, Toal Fiona, Cleare Anthony, Surguladze Simon, Murphy Declan G M",Archives of general psychiatry,"Adolescent, Adult, Autistic Disorder, Brain, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Emotions, Facial Expression, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Serotonin, Tryptophan, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22638012,"Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Science, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, London, England. eileen.daly@kcl.ac.uk"

One hundred and sixty children with autism spectrum disorders, aged 4-10 years, suffering from sleep onset insomnia and impaired sleep maintenance, were assigned randomly to either (1) combination of controlled-release melatonin and cognitive-behavioural therapy; (2) controlled-release melatonin; (3) four sessions of cognitive-behavioural therapy; or (4) placebo drug treatment condition for 12 weeks in a 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 ratio. Children were studied at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. Treatment response was assessed with 1-week actigraphic monitoring, sleep diary and sleep questionnaire. Main outcome measures, derived actigraphically, were sleep latency, total sleep time, wake after sleep onset and number of awakenings. The active treatment groups all resulted in improvements across all outcome measures, with moderate-to-large effect sizes from baseline to a 12-week assessment. Melatonin treatment was mainly effective in reducing insomnia symptoms, while cognitive-behavioural therapy had a light positive impact mainly on sleep latency, suggesting that some behavioural aspects might play a role in determining initial insomnia. The combination treatment group showed a trend to outperform other active treatment groups, with fewer dropouts and a greater proportion of treatment responders achieving clinically significant changes (63.38% normative sleep efficiency criterion of >85% and 84.62%, sleep onset latency <30 min).

Milieu teaching and the combined intervention produced higher rates of language targets than did responsive interaction. An analysis of the type and function of language targets suggested that differences between conditions were driven primarily by prompted-and, to a lesser extent, spontaneous-requests. Social engagement ratings were higher during each intervention than at baseline, but differences between treatment conditions were not consistent across children. For children with autism, naturalistic interventions that use direct elicitation of child language lead to greater short-term gains in the use of expressive language targets-in particular, prompted requests-than interventions that use facilitative strategies only. All 3 naturalistic language interventions can promote social engagement.

However, public debate over the safety of the trivalent MMR vaccine and the resultant drop in vaccination coverage in several countries persists, despite its almost universal use and accepted effectiveness. To assess the effectiveness and adverse effects associated with the MMR vaccine in children up to 15 years of age. For this update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, PubMed (July 2004 to May week 2, 2011) and Embase.com (July 2004 to May 2011). We used comparative prospective or retrospective trials assessing the effects of the MMR vaccine compared to placebo, do nothing or a combination of measles, mumps and rubella antigens on healthy individuals up to 15 years of age. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality of the included studies. One review author arbitrated in case of disagreement. We included five randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one controlled clinical trial (CCT), 27 cohort studies, 17 case-control studies, five time-series trials, one case cross-over trial, two ecological studies, six self controlled case series studies involving in all about 14,700,000 children and assessing effectiveness and safety of MMR vaccine. Based on the available evidence, one MMR vaccine dose is at least 95% effective in preventing clinical measles and 92% effective in preventing secondary cases among household contacts.Effectiveness of at least one dose of MMR in preventing clinical mumps in children is estimated to be between 69% and 81% for the vaccine prepared with Jeryl Lynn mumps strain and between 70% and 75% for the vaccine containing the Urabe strain. Vaccination with MMR containing the Urabe strain has demonstrated to be 73% effective in preventing secondary mumps cases. Effectiveness of Jeryl Lynn containing MMR in preventing laboratory-confirmed mumps cases in children and adolescents was estimated to be between 64% to 66% for one dose and 83% to 88% for two vaccine doses. We did not identify any studies assessing the effectiveness of MMR in preventing rubella.The highest risk of association with aseptic meningitis was observed within the third week after immunisation with Urabe-containing MMR (risk ratio (RR) 14.28; 95% confidence interval (CI) from 7.93 to 25.71) and within the third (RR 22.5; 95% CI 11.8 to 42.9) or fifth (RR 15.6; 95% CI 10.3 to 24.2) weeks after immunisation with the vaccine prepared with the Leningrad-Zagreb strain. A significant risk of association with febrile seizures and MMR exposure during the two previous weeks (RR 1.10; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.15) was assessed in one large person-time cohort study involving 537,171 children aged between three months and five year of age. Increased risk of febrile seizure has also been observed in children aged between 12 to 23 months (relative incidence (RI) 4.09; 95% CI 3.1 to 5.33) and children aged 12 to 35 months (RI 5.68; 95% CI 2.31 to 13.97) within six to 11 days after exposure to MMR vaccine. An increased risk of thrombocytopenic purpura within six weeks after MMR immunisation in children aged 12 to 23 months was assessed in one case-control study (RR 6.3; 95% CI 1.3 to 30.1) and in one small self controlled case series (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 5.38; 95% CI 2.72 to 10.62). Increased risk of thrombocytopenic purpura within six weeks after MMR exposure was also assessed in one other case-control study involving 2311 children and adolescents between one month and 18 years (odds ratio (OR) 2.4; 95% CI 1.2 to 4.7). Exposure to the MMR vaccine was unlikely to be associated with autism, asthma, leukaemia, hay fever, type 1 diabetes, gait disturbance, Crohn's disease, demyelinating diseases, bacterial or viral infections. The design and reporting of safety outcomes in MMR vaccine studies, both pre- and post-marketing, are largely inadequate. The evidence of adverse events following immunisation with the MMR vaccine cannot be separated from its role in preventing the target diseases.","Demicheli Vittorio, Rivetti Alessandro, Debalini Maria Grazia, Di Pietrantonj Carlo",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Adolescent, Age Factors, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Clinical Trials as Topic, Crohn Disease, Epidemiologic Studies, Humans, Infant, Measles, Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine, Mumps, Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Rubella, Seizures, Febrile, Vaccines, Attenuated",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22336803,"Servizio Regionale di Riferimento per l’Epidemiologia, SSEpi-SeREMI - Cochrane Vaccines Field, Azienda Sanitaria Locale ASL AL,Alessandria, Italy. vdemicheli@aslal.it"

Several reports indicate that children with ASD show reduced error processing and deficient behavioral correction after an error is committed. Error sensitivity can be readily examined by measuring event-related potentials (ERP) associated with responses to errors, the fronto-central error-related negativity (ERN), and the error-related positivity (Pe). The goal of our study was to investigate whether reaction time (RT), error rate, post-error RT change, ERN, and Pe will show positive changes following 12-week long slow frequency repetitive TMS (rTMS) over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in high functioning children with ASD. We hypothesized that 12 sessions of 1 Hz rTMS bilaterally applied over the DLPFC will result in improvements reflected in both behavioral and ERP measures. Participants were randomly assigned to either active rTMS treatment or wait-list (WTL) groups. Baseline and post-TMS/or WTL EEG was collected using 128 channel EEG system. The task involved the recognition of a specific illusory shape, in this case a square or triangle, created by three or four inducer disks. ERN in TMS treatment group became significantly more negative. The number of omission errors decreased post-TMS. The RT did not change, but post-error RT became slower. There were no changes in RT, error rate, post-error RT slowing, nor in ERN/Pe measures in the wait-list group. Our results show significant post-TMS differences in the response-locked ERP such as ERN, as well as behavioral response monitoring measures indicative of improved error monitoring and correction function. The ERN and Pe, along with behavioral performance measures, can be used as functional outcome measures to assess the effectiveness of neuromodulation (e.g., rTMS) in children with autism and thus may have important practical implications.","Sokhadze Estate M, Baruth Joshua M, Sears Lonnie, Sokhadze Guela E, El-Baz Ayman S, Casanova Manuel F",Applied psychophysiology and biofeedback,"Adolescent, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child Behavior, Data Interpretation, Statistical, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Electroencephalography, Electrooculography, Evoked Potentials, Female, Humans, Intelligence Tests, Male, Neuropsychological Tests, Prefrontal Cortex, Psychomotor Performance, Reaction Time, Self Concept, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22311204,"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Louisville School of Medicine, KY 40202, USA. tato.sokhadze@louisville.edu"

Changes obtained at the end of the treatment persisted to the 3-month follow-up.   These data suggest that significant improvements can be made in peer social connections for children with autism spectrum disorders in general education classrooms with a brief intervention, and that these gains persist over time.","Kasari Connie, Rotheram-Fuller Erin, Locke Jill, Gulsrud Amanda","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","Analysis of Variance, Behavior Therapy, Child, Child Behavior, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Friends, Humans, Interpersonal Relations, Male, Peer Group, Play and Playthings, Program Evaluation, Schools, Social Behavior, Socialization, Students, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22118062,"Center for Autism Research and Treatment, Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, University of California, 760 Westwood Plaza, Los Angeles, CA 90024, USA. kasari@gseis.ucla.edu"

Recent reviews of the effectiveness of early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) conclude that EIBI can improve language and cognitive skills. The first randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a comprehensive early intervention for toddlers with ASD demonstrated gains in language, cognitive abilities, and adaptive behavior. Targeted, brief behavioral interventions are efficacious for improving social communication in young children with ASD. Parents can be taught to deliver behavioral interventions, which are associated with improvements in parent-child interaction; effects on child outcome, however, have been mixed. Several studies show that social skills interventions are efficacious for improving peer relationships and social competence. Behavioral interventions are also effective for reducing anxiety symptoms and aggression. Medication combined with behavioral intervention was found to be more effective for reducing aggression than medication alone. Behavioral interventions are effective for improving language, cognitive abilities, adaptive behavior, and social skills, and reducing anxiety and aggression. Medication combined with behavioral intervention appears to be more effective for reducing aggressive behavior than medication alone.","Dawson Geraldine, Burner Karen",Current opinion in pediatrics,"Adaptation, Psychological, Adolescent, Behavior Therapy, Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Cognition, Humans, Language, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22037220,"Autism Speaks and Department of Psychiatry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA. gdawson@autismspeaks.org"

The data for the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are less promising. New avenues of pharmacologic research targeting molecular targets identified by genomics, animal models and neuropathology are being evaluated. Areas of interest include glutamate/gamma-aminobutyric acid systems, neuropeptides such as oxytocin, and immune dysfunction, among others. In the case of biologically based CAM, a few compounds have been shown to be well tolerated, although efficacy is still being evaluated, such as melatonin, certain vitamins, and omega 3 fatty acids.

Noncompliance to blood draws can have significant ramifications in both research and clinical settings. The negative reactions may be exacerbated in individuals with autism spectrum disorders. Even so, there has been little research into the prevalence of the problem or effective intervention procedures. In response to these concerns, we developed and evaluated the Blood Draw Intervention Program. The program was designed to be easy to use, require little provider or family time, effectively reduce negative behaviors, and increase blood draw compliance. In a quasi-randomized trial over the course of ∼ 18 months, 58 of 210 families with children with autism spectrum disorders participating in a larger study of phenotypic and genotypic factors reported significant concerns about blood draws and elected to use the Blood Draw Intervention Program. Completion of the program increased blood draw compliance rates from 85.4% to 96.6% (odds ratio = 4.80; 95% confidence interval = 1.12, 20.59; p = .03).

Object naming was assessed before and after low-frequency rTMS of the left pars opercularis, left pars triangularis, right pars opercularis and right pars triangularis, and sham stimulation, as guided stereotaxically by each individual's brain magnetic resonance imaging. In ASP participants, naming improved after rTMS of the left pars triangularis as compared with sham stimulation, whereas rTMS of the adjacent left opercularis lengthened naming latency. In healthy subjects, stimulation of parts of Broca's area did not lead to significant changes in naming skills, consistent with published data. Overall, these findings support our hypothesis of abnormal language neural network dynamics in individuals with ASP.

The interventions provided identical intensity (10 hours per week in classroom), student-to-teacher ratio, schedule, home-based parent training (1.5 hours per month), parent education (38 hours), and instructional strategies, except the Interpersonal Synchrony condition provided a supplementary curriculum targeting socially engaged imitation, joint attention, and affect sharing; measures of these were primary outcomes. Assessments were conducted pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, and, to assess maintenance, at six-month follow-up. Random effects models were used to examine differences between groups over time. Secondary analyses examined gains in expressive language and nonverbal cognition, and time effects during the intervention and follow-up periods. A significant treatment effect was found for socially engaged imitation (p = .02), with more than doubling (17% to 42%) of imitated acts paired with eye contact in the Interpersonal Synchrony group after the intervention. This skill was generalized to unfamiliar contexts and maintained through follow-up. Similar gains were observed for initiation of joint attention and shared positive affect, but between-group differences did not reach statistical significance. A significant time effect was found for all outcomes (p < .001); greatest change occurred during the intervention period, particularly in the Interpersonal Synchrony group. This is the first ASD randomized trial involving toddlers to identify an active ingredient for enhancing socially engaged imitation. Adding social engagement targets to intervention improves short-term outcome at no additional cost to the intervention. The social, language, and cognitive gains in our participants provide evidence for plasticity of these developmental systems in toddlers with ASD. http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00106210?term = landa&rank = 3.","Landa Rebecca J, Holman Katherine C, O'Neill Allison H, Stuart Elizabeth A","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","Behavior Therapy, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Child, Preschool, Cognition, Communication, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Imitative Behavior, Infant, Male, Neuropsychological Tests, Parents, Treatment Outcome, Verbal Behavior",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21126245,"Kennedy Krieger Institute, Center for Autism and Related Disorders, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Baltimore, MD, USA. landa@kennedykrieger.org"

Electrophysiological research has provided evidence that gamma band activity (30-80 Hz) is a physiological indicator of the co-activation of cortical cells engaged in processing visual stimuli and integrating different features of a stimulus. A number of studies have found augmented and indiscriminative gamma band power at early stages of visual processing in ASD; this may be related to decreased inhibitory processing and an increase in the ratio of cortical excitation to inhibition. Low frequency or 'slow' (≤1HZ) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been shown to increase inhibition of stimulated cortex by the activation of inhibitory circuits. METHODS: We wanted to test the hypothesis of gamma band abnormalities at early stages of visual processing in ASD by investigating relative evoked (i.e. ~ 100 ms) gamma power in 25 subjects with ASD and 20 age-matched controls using Kanizsa illusory figures. Additionally, we wanted to assess the effects of 12 sessions of bilateral 'slow' rTMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on evoked gamma activity using a randomized controlled design. RESULTS: In individuals with ASD evoked gamma activity was not discriminative of stimulus type, whereas in controls early gamma power differences between target and non-target stimuli were highly significant. Following rTMS individuals with ASD showed significant improvement in discriminatory gamma activity between relevant and irrelevant visual stimuli. We also found significant improvement in the responses on behavioral questionnaires (i.e., irritability, repetitive behavior) as a result of rTMS. CONCLUSION: We proposed that 'slow' rTMS may have increased cortical inhibitory tone which improved discriminatory gamma activity at early stages of visual processing. rTMS has the potential to become an important therapeutic tool in ASD treatment and has shown significant benefits in treating core symptoms of ASD with few, if any side effects.","Baruth Joshua M, Casanova Manuel F, El-Baz Ayman, Horrell Tim, Mathai Grace, Sears Lonnie, Sokhadze Estate",Journal of neurotherapy,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21116441,"Department of Anatomical Sciences and Neurobiology, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY 40202."

We carried out a review of randomized controlled trials to give an update on which psychological treatments are empirically supported for these disorders, and used the criteria set out by Chambless and Hollon [1998: J Consult Clin Psychol 66:7-18] to draw conclusions about efficacy, first irrespective of trauma type and second with regard to particular populations. The PsycINFO and PubMed databases were searched electronically to identify suitable articles published up to the end of 2008. Fifty-seven studies satisfied our inclusion criteria. Looking at the literature undifferentiated by trauma type, there was evidence that trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) are efficacious and specific for PTSD, stress inoculation training, hypnotherapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and psychodynamic therapy are possibly efficacious for PTSD and trauma-focused CBT is possibly efficacious for ASD. Not one of these treatments has been tested with the full range of trauma groups, though there is evidence that trauma-focused CBT is established in efficacy for assault- and road traffic accident-related PTSD. Trauma-focused CBT and to a lesser extent EMDR (due to fewer studies having been conducted and many having had a mixed trauma sample) are the psychological treatments of choice for PTSD, but further research of these and other therapies with different populations is needed.","Ponniah Kathryn, Hollon Steven D",Depression and anxiety,"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Empiricism, Evidence-Based Medicine, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing, Humans, Psychotherapy, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Research, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic, Stress Disorders, Traumatic, Acute, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19957280,"New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York, USA. kathrynbetts@hotmail.com"

Forty-eight children diagnosed with ASD between 18 and 30 months of age were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: (1) ESDM intervention, which is based on developmental and applied behavioral analytic principles and delivered by trained therapists and parents for 2 years; or (2) referral to community providers for intervention commonly available in the community. Compared with children who received community-intervention, children who received ESDM showed significant improvements in IQ, adaptive behavior, and autism diagnosis. Two years after entering intervention, the ESDM group on average improved 17.6 standard score points (1 SD: 15 points) compared with 7.0 points in the comparison group relative to baseline scores. The ESDM group maintained its rate of growth in adaptive behavior compared with a normative sample of typically developing children. In contrast, over the 2-year span, the comparison group showed greater delays in adaptive behavior. Children who received ESDM also were more likely to experience a change in diagnosis from autism to pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified, than the comparison group. This is the first randomized, controlled trial to demonstrate the efficacy of a comprehensive developmental behavioral intervention for toddlers with ASD for improving cognitive and adaptive behavior and reducing severity of ASD diagnosis.

These results suggest that individuals with autism over-process information needed for the successful differentiation of target and novel stimuli. In the present study we examine the effects of low-frequency, repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) on novelty processing as well as behavior and social functioning in 13 individuals with ASD. Our hypothesis was that low-frequency rTMS application to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC) would result in an alteration of the cortical excitatory/inhibitory balance through the activation of inhibitory GABAergic double bouquet interneurons. We expected to find post-TMS differences in amplitude and latency of early and late ERP components. The results of our current study validate the use of low-frequency rTMS as a modulatory tool that altered the disrupted ratio of cortical excitation to inhibition in autism. After rTMS the parieto-occipital P50 amplitude decreased to novel distracters but not to targets; also the amplitude and latency to targets increased for the frontal P50 while decreasing to non-target stimuli. Low-frequency rTMS minimized early cortical responses to irrelevant stimuli and increased responses to relevant stimuli. Improved selectivity in early cortical responses lead to better stimulus differentiation at later-stage responses as was made evident by our P3b and P3a component findings. These results indicate a significant change in early, middle-latency and late ERP components at the frontal, centro-parietal, and parieto-occipital regions of interest in response to target and distracter stimuli as a result of rTMS treatment. Overall, our preliminary results show that rTMS may prove to be an important research tool or treatment modality in addressing the stimulus hypersensitivity characteristic of autism spectrum disorders.","Sokhadze Estate, Baruth Joshua, Tasman Allan, Mansoor Mehreen, Ramaswamy Rajesh, Sears Lonnie, Mathai Grace, El-Baz Ayman, Casanova Manuel F",Applied psychophysiology and biofeedback,"Adolescent, Adult, Autistic Disorder, Behavior, Cerebral Cortex, Child, Electroencephalography, Evoked Potentials, Female, Humans, Hyperkinesis, Interneurons, Male, Mental Processes, Photic Stimulation, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Reaction Time, Social Behavior, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19941058,"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY, 40292, USA. tato.sokhadze@louisville.edu"

19068339,10.1016/J.Encep.2007.10.011,[Substitutive and dietetic approaches in childhood autistic disorder: interests and limits].,2008-10-01,"Autism is a developmental disorder that requires specialized therapeutic approaches. Influenced by various theoretical hypotheses, therapeutic programs are typically structured on a psychodynamic, biological or educative basis. Presently, educational strategies are recommended in the treatment of autism, without excluding other approaches when they are necessary. Some authors recommend dietetic or complementary approaches to the treatment of autism, which often stimulates great interest in the parents but also provokes controversy for professionals. Nevertheless, professionals must be informed about this approach because parents are actively in demand of it. First of all, enzymatic disorders and metabolic errors are those most frequently evoked in the literature. The well-known phenylalanine hydroxylase deficit responsible for phenylketonuria has been described as being associated with autism. In this case, adapted diet prevents mental retardation and autistic symptoms. Some enzymatic errors are also corrected by supplementation with uridine or ribose for example, but these supplementations are the responsibility of specialized medical teams in the domain of neurology and cannot be applied by parents alone. Secondly, increased opoid activity due to an excess of peptides is also supposed to be at the origin of some autistic symptoms. Gluten-free or casein-free diets have thus been tested in controlled studies, with contradictory results. With such diets, some studies show symptom regression but others report negative side effects, essentially protein malnutrition. Methodological bias, small sample sizes, the use of various diagnostic criteria or heterogeneity of evaluation interfere with data analysis and interpretation, which prompted professionals to be cautious with such diets. The third hypothesis emphasized in the literature is the amino acid domain. Some autistic children lack some amino acids such as glutamic or aspartic acids for example and this deficiency would create autistic symptoms. However, for some authors, these deficits are attributed to nutritional deficits caused by the food selectivity of children. A fourth hypothesis concerning metabolic implication in autism is the suspicion that a food allergy phenomenon could interfere with development, and it has been observed that Ig levels are higher in autistic children than in control children. Autistic children with a positive reaction to food Ig would have a more favourable outcome with diet excluding some kinds of food; but most of those diets are drastic and ethically debatable. Fifth, glucidic catabolism could be deleterious with an excess of ketonic products that will initiate comitial seizures. Few studies with ketogenic diet have been conducted but, as it has been described with epileptic subjects, those diets would diminish autistic symptoms. Not enough studies have been conducted that would allow one to draw any firm conclusions. The sixth hypothesis is linked with vitamin deficiencies that are a notably important area of research in the treatment of autism. Vitamin B12 or B6 deficiencies have been studied in several articles, and many of them were controlled studies. French teams also emphasize an interest in supplementation with B12 or B6. The two last hypotheses concern auto-immune patterns and the toxic effects of heavy metals like mercury. There is a paucity of methodologically satisfying studies that support these two hypotheses and diet recommendations. Following these assumptions, some dietetic approaches have been recommended, even though the methodological aspects of supporting studies are poor. The most famous diet is the gluten-free and/or casein-free diet. Only two controlled studies attracted our attention. Even if for some autistic children such a diet was positive, for others, gluten-free or casein-free diets were poorly tolerated and, for some authors, not without considerable side effects, the more prejudicial of which was the Kwashiorkor risk. Ketogenic diets have been studied in one non controlled study, but even if positive results have been noted by the authors, the ketogenic diet is very restricting and the long term effects have not been evaluated. Vitamin supplementation is the one and only diet domain where there have been many repeated and placebo-controlled studies. Side effects are rare and mild even if high doses of vitamin B6 are advocated in these studies. In total, as evoked by Rimland, 11 controlled placebo-blind studies have been conducted and 50% of autistic children with this supplementation had improved autistic signs. However, these results still remain debated. Finally, more rarely, enzymatic abnormalities need specific diets which have some positive consequences, but such diets could not be applied by parents alone and are the responsibility of specialized teams. For discussion purposes we can emphasize that, in spite of the amount of studies concerning the effects of specialized diets, few are methodologically satisfying. We can not ignore that some side effects are possible with such approaches and parents need to be informed of them. Some are even potentially serious, such as diets with metal chelators. In spite of those results, vitamin supplementation seems to be the only one that some specialized teams in autism could apply, always with parent agreement. In conclusion, within this scientific field, studies on eating habits of autistic children should be conducted because of their food selectivity or avoidance.","Hjiej H, Doyen C, Couprie C, Kaye K, Contejean Y",L'Encephale,"Autistic Disorder, Child, Complementary Therapies, Diet Therapy, Dietary Supplements, Humans, Vitamins",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19068339,"Service de psychopathologie de l'enfant et de l'adolescent, centre hospitalier Sainte-Anne, 14, rue Cabanis, 75014 Paris, France."

This behavior checklist (57 items) allows the detailed description of non-adaptable characteristics regarding the following areas: sensory, use of the body and object, Language, Psycho-social and Relational. The questionnaire was filled in during an interview on three occasions: at the beginning of intervention, after six months and at the end of 12 months. after statistical analysis it was observed that there was a greater development in the total scores and in the areas of language, psycho-social and relational for the TG. This suggests a greater development pattern during the studied period for this group. the mothers of both groups observed behavioral changes. The better scores observed for the TG is probably related to the effectiveness of direct intervention, and not to the lack of attention of parents in the OG in recognizing behavioral changes in their children.","Tamanaha Ana Carina, Perissinoto Jacy, Chiari Brasilia Maria",Pro-fono : revista de atualizacao cientifica,"Asperger Syndrome, Autistic Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Child, Child, Preschool, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Humans, Interpersonal Relations, Language Development Disorders, Language Therapy, Male, Mothers, Parent-Child Relations, Social Behavior, Surveys and Questionnaires",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18852963,"Universidade Federal de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brasil. anacarina.otor@unifesp.epm.br"

Cognitive behavioral therapy for ASD may prevent PTSD, but trauma survivors may not tolerate exposure-based therapy in the acute phase. There is a need to compare nonexposure therapy techniques with prolonged exposure for ASD. To determine the efficacy of exposure therapy or trauma-focused cognitive restructuring in preventing chronic PTSD relative to a wait-list control group. A randomized controlled trial of civilians who experienced trauma and who met the diagnostic criteria for ASD (N = 90) seen at an outpatient clinic between March 1, 2002, and June 30, 2006. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 5 weekly 90-minute sessions of either imaginal and in vivo exposure (n = 30) or cognitive restructuring (n = 30), or assessment at baseline and after 6 weeks (wait-list group; n = 30). Measures of PTSD at the 6-month follow-up visit by clinical interview and self-report assessments of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and trauma-related cognition. Intent-to-treat analyses indicated that at posttreatment, fewer patients in the exposure group had PTSD than those in the cognitive restructuring or wait-list groups (33% vs 63% vs 77%; P = .002). At follow-up, patients who underwent exposure therapy were more likely to not meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD than those who underwent cognitive restructuring (37% vs 63%; odds ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-3.94; P = .05) and to achieve full remission (47% vs 13%; odds ratio, 2.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-6.83; P = .005). On assessments of PTSD, depression, and anxiety, exposure resulted in markedly larger effect sizes at posttreatment and follow-up than cognitive restructuring. Exposure-based therapy leads to greater reduction in subsequent PTSD symptoms in patients with ASD when compared with cognitive restructuring.

Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated positive effects in both short-term and longer term studies. The evidence suggests that early intervention programs are indeed beneficial for children with autism, often improving developmental functioning and decreasing maladaptive behaviors and symptom severity at the level of group analysis. Whether such changes lead to significant improvements in terms of greater independence and vocational and social functioning in adulthood is also unknown. Given the few randomized controlled treatment trials that have been carried out, the few models that have been tested, and the large differences in interventions that are being published, it is clear that the field is still very early in the process of determining (a) what kinds of interventions are most efficacious in early autism, (b) what variables moderate and mediate treatment gains and improved outcomes following intervention, and (c) the degree of both short-term and long-term improvements that can reasonably be expected. To examine these current research needs, the empirical studies of comprehensive treatments for young children with autism published since 1998 were reviewed. Lovaas's treatment meet Chambless and colleague's (Chambless et al., 1998; Chambless et al., 1996) criteria for ""well-established"" and no treatment meets the ""probably efficacious"" criteria, though three treatments meet criteria for ""possibly efficacious"" (Chambless & Hollon, 1998). Most studies were either Type 2 or 3 in terms of their methodological rigor based on Nathan and Gorman's (2002) criteria.

For the past few years, we have been observing 2- to 4-year-old children with autism interacting with Keepon, a creature-like robot that is only capable of expressing its attention (directing its gaze) and emotions (pleasure and excitement). While controlled by a remote experimenter, Keepon interacted with the children with its simple appearance and actions. With a sense of curiosity and security, the children spontaneously approached Keepon and engaged in dyadic interaction with it, which then extended to triadic interactions where they exchanged with adult caregivers pleasure and surprise they found in Keepon. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of these unfolding interactions suggests that autistic children possess the motivation to share mental states with others, which is contrary to the commonly held position that this motivation is impaired in autism. We assume Keepon's minimal expressiveness helped the children understand socially meaningful information, which then activated their intact motivation to share interests and feelings with others. We conclude that simple robots like Keepon would facilitate social interaction and its development in autistic children.","Kozima Hideki, Nakagawa Cocoro, Yasuda Yuriko",Progress in brain research,"Autistic Disorder, Child, Preschool, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Female, Humans, Infant, Interpersonal Relations, Male, Pilot Projects, Play and Playthings, Robotics, Social Behavior",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17920443,"National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Hikaridai 3-5, Seika, Soraku, Kyoto 619-0289, Japan. xkozima@nict.go.jp"

Whereas the safety and efficacy of risperidone have been established for children aged 5 and older, they has not been adequately tested in preschool children. A randomized placebo-controlled study of risperidone in preschool children was conducted in a sample of young children, most of whom were also undergoing intensive behavioral treatment. Preschool children tolerated low-dose risperidone well with no serious adverse effects observed over a 6-month treatment period. Weight gain and hypersalivation were the most common side effects reported, and hyperprolactinemia without lactation or related signs was observed. Significant differences between groups found at baseline complicated the analyses; however, controlling for some of these differences revealed that preschoolers on risperidone demonstrated greater improvements in autism severity. The change in autism severity scores from baseline to 6-month follow up for the risperidone group was 8% compared to 3% for the placebo group. Notably, both groups significantly improved over the 6-month treatment period. Study findings suggest that risperidone is well tolerated in preschoolers over a 6-month period, but that only minimally greater improvement in target symptoms was evident in the risperidone group, possibly due to the differences between groups at baseline or due to the small sample size.

In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study over 12 weeks in 29 patients with RA being treated with prednisolone, 13 of whom received placebo and 16 of whom received 8 mg MRA/kg body weight, the effects of MRA on serum levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulfate (DHEAS), androstenedione (ASD), estrone, and 17beta-estradiol, as well as their respective molar ratios, were determined. MRA therapy markedly improved clinical signs of inflammation (the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, swollen joint score, and Disease Activity Score in 28 joints). Serum levels of ACTH and cortisol and the molar ratio of cortisol to ACTH did not change. Although serum levels of DHEA and DHEAS remained stable during therapy, the DHEAS:DHEA molar ratio significantly decreased in treated patients (P = 0.048). Serum levels of ASD as well as the ASD:cortisol and ASD:17OHP molar ratios increased in MRA-treated patients (minimum P < 0.004). Serum levels of estrone and 17beta-estradiol did not change. but the estrone:ASD molar ratio (an indicator of aromatization) decreased during 12 weeks of MRA treatment (P = 0.001). Neutralization of IL-6 increases secretion of biologically active adrenal androgens in relation to that of precursor hormones and estrogens. This is another important indication that proinflammatory cytokines interfere with adrenal androgen steroidogenesis in patients with RA.","Straub Rainer H, Härle Peter, Yamana Seizo, Matsuda Takemasa, Takasugi Kiyoshi, Kishimoto Tadamitsu, Nishimoto Norihiro",Arthritis and rheumatism,"17-alpha-Hydroxyprogesterone, Adrenal Glands, Adrenocorticotropic Hormone, Adult, Aged, Androgens, Androstenedione, Antibodies, Monoclonal, Arthritis, Rheumatoid, Dehydroepiandrosterone, Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate, Double-Blind Method, Estradiol, Estrone, Female, Humans, Hydrocortisone, Male, Middle Aged, Prednisolone, Receptors, Interleukin-6",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16729287,"University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany. rainer.straub@klinik.uni-regensburg.de"

A CPEA Study.,2006-04-01,"A multi-site study of 351 children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and 31 typically developing children used caregiver interviews to describe the children's early acquisition and loss of social-communication milestones. For the majority of children with ASD who had experienced a regression, pre-loss development was clearly atypical. Children who had lost skills also showed slightly poorer outcomes in verbal IQ and social reciprocity, a later mean age of onset of autistic symptoms, and more gastrointestinal symptoms than children with ASD and no regression. There was no evidence that onset of autistic symptoms or of regression was related to measles-mumps-rubella vaccination.

The authors conducted a 3-year prospective outcome study that compared 2 groups: (1) 21 children who received 35 to 40 hours per week of EIBT from a community agency that replicated Lovaas' model of EIBT and (2) 21 age- and IQ-matched children in special education classes at local public schools. A quasi-experimental design was used, with assignment to groups based on parental preference. Assessments were conducted by independent examiners for IQ (Bayley Scales of Infant Development or Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence), language (Reynell Developmental Language Scales), nonverbal skill (Merrill-Palmer Scale of Mental Tests), and adaptive behavior (Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales). Analyses of covariance, with baseline scores as covariates and Year 1-3 assessments as repeated measures, revealed that, with treatment, the EIBT group obtained significantly higher IQ (F = 5.21, p = .03) and adaptive behavior scores (F = 7.84, p = .01) than did the comparison group. No difference between groups was found in either language comprehension (F = 3.82, p = .06) or nonverbal skill. Six of the 21 EIBT children were fully included into regular education without assistance at Year 3, and 11 others were included with support; in contrast, only 1 comparison child was placed primarily in regular education.

A randomized, group-comparison design involving a parent education and counseling intervention to control for nonspecific therapist effects and a control sample was used. Two metropolitan and two rural regions were randomly allocated to intervention groups (n = 70) or control (n = 35). The parents of consecutive children with autism (2(1/2)-5 years old) from the autism assessment services for the intervention regions were then randomly allocated to either a 20-week manual-based parent education and behavior management intervention (n = 35) or a manual-based parent education and counseling intervention (n = 35). The main outcome measure of parental mental health was the General Health Questionnaire used pre- and postintervention and at 6-month follow-up. Both treatments resulted in significant and progressive improvement in overall mental health at follow-up (F = 2, 97, p =.007) and mental health significantly improved over time in the 54% of principal caregivers who had the highest levels of mental health problems. The parent education and behavior management intervention was effective in alleviating a greater percentage of anxiety, insomnia, and somatic symptoms and family dysfunction than parent education and counseling at 6-month follow-up. A 20-week parent education and skills training program for parents of young children newly diagnosed with autism provides significant improvements in parental mental health and adjustment, justifying its addition to early intervention programs at least for parents with mental health problems.","Tonge Bruce, Brereton Avril, Kiomall Melissa, Mackinnon Andrew, King Neville, Rinehart Nicole",Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,"Adaptation, Psychological, Adult, Autistic Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Child of Impaired Parents, Child, Preschool, Combined Modality Therapy, Counseling, Early Intervention, Educational, Education, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Mental Disorders, Parents, Personality Inventory",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16670650,"At the time of this study, all of the authors were with the Monash University Centre for Developmental Psychiatry, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.

A second interest was to evaluate whether more intensive parent involvement would increase the child's ability to manage anxiety outside of the clinic setting. Seventy-one children aged ten to twelve years were recruited to participate in the anxiety programme. All children were diagnosed with AS and the presence of anxiety symptoms was accepted on parent report via brief interview. Children were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: intervention for child only, intervention for child and parent, wait-list control. The two intervention groups demonstrated significant decreases in parent-reported anxiety symptoms at follow-up and a significant increase in the child's ability to generate positive strategies in an anxiety-provoking situation. There were a number of significant differences between the two interventions to suggest parent involvement as beneficial. The sample of children with AS in this study presented with a profile of anxiety similar to a sample of clinically diagnosed anxious children. The intervention was endorsed by parents as a useful programme for children diagnosed with Asperger syndrome and exhibiting anxiety symptoms, and active parent involvement enhanced the usefulness of the programme.

We carried out a systematic review to assess the evidence of effectiveness and unintended effects associated with MMR. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to December 2004), EMBASE (1974 to December 2004), Biological Abstracts (from 1985 to December 2004), and Science Citation Index (from 1980 to December 2004). Results from reviews, handsearching and from the consultation of manufacturers and authors were also used. Eligible studies were comparative prospective or retrospective trials testing the effects of MMR compared to placebo, do-nothing or a combination of measles, mumps and rubella antigens on healthy individuals up to 15 years of age. These studies were carried out or published by 2004. We identified 139 articles possibly satisfying our inclusion criteria and included 31 in the review. MMR was associated with a lower incidence of upper respiratory tract infections, a higher incidence of irritability, and similar incidence of other adverse effects compared to placebo. The vaccine was likely to be associated with benign thrombocytopenic purpura, parotitis, joint and limb complaints, febrile convulsions within two weeks of vaccination and aseptic meningitis (mumps) (Urabe strain-containing MMR). Exposure to MMR was unlikely to be associated with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, autism or aseptic meningitis (mumps) (Jeryl-Lynn strain-containing MMR). We could not identify studies assessing the effectiveness of MMR that fulfilled our inclusion criteria even though the impact of mass immunisation on the elimination of the diseases has been largely demonstrated. The design and reporting of safety outcomes in MMR vaccine studies, both pre- and post-marketing, are largely inadequate. The evidence of adverse events following immunisation with MMR cannot be separated from its role in preventing the target diseases.","Demicheli V, Jefferson T, Rivetti A, Price D",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Adolescent, Autistic Disorder, Child, Clinical Trials as Topic, Crohn Disease, Humans, Measles, Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine, Mumps, Rubella, Vaccines, Attenuated",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16235361,"Servizo Sovrazonale di Epidemiologia, ASL 20, Via Venezia 6, Alessandria, Piemonte, Italy 15100. demichelivittorio@asl20.piemonte.it"

Research regarding mechanisms of placebo effects is reviewed, including patient and clinician attributes, expectancy effects, participation effects, changes in caregiver behavior, and conditioning. New evidence regarding the biological basis of placebo effects is briefly presented. Since placebo effects are ubiquitous and may operate by a variety of mechanisms, research design is critical in designing clinical trials and in evaluating other outcomes research. Measurement issues important for research in developmental disabilities are emphasized. Ethical concerns have been raised regarding the use of placebo in clinical research, but current analysis suggests that placebo controls are necessary and defensible on ethical grounds, if certain conditions are met.

Variables of interest were number and intensity of problem behaviours, and parent evaluation of social interaction skills. Results showed parents reporting fewer and lower intensity of problem behaviours and increased social interactions at 4 weeks and 3 months.

We carried out a systematic review to assess the evidence of unintended effects (beneficial or harmful) associated with MMR and the applicability of systematic reviewing methods to the field of safety evaluation. Eligible studies were comparative prospective or retrospective on healthy individuals up to 15 years of age, carried out or published by 2003. We identified 120 articles satisfying our inclusion criteria and included 22. MMR is associated with a lower incidence of upper respiratory tract infections, a higher incidence of irritability, similar incidence of other adverse effects compared to placebo and is likely to be associated with benign thrombocytopenic purpura (TP), parotitis, joint and limb complaints and aseptic meningitis (mumps Urabe strain-containing MMR). Exposure to MMR is unlikely to be associated with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, autism or aseptic meningitis (mumps Jeryl-Lynn strain-containing MMR). The design and reporting of safety outcomes in MMR vaccine studies, both pre- and post-marketing, are largely inadequate. The evidence of adverse events following immunization with MMR cannot be separated from its role in preventing the target diseases.","Jefferson Tom, Price Deirdre, Demicheli Vittorio, Bianco Elvira,  ",Vaccine,"Bias, Case-Control Studies, Cohort Studies, Ecology, Humans, Infant, Newborn, Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine, Prospective Studies, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Research Design, Retrospective Studies, Twin Studies as Topic, Vaccines, Attenuated",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12922131,"Reparto Epidemiologia Clinica, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Viale Regina Elena, 299-00161 Rome, Italy. toj1@aol.com"

Although many researchers have noted the importance of joint attention deficits in the development of children with autism (e.g., Mundy, Sigman, & Kasari, 1994) and have called for intervention strategies (e.g., Mundy & Crowson, 1997), few studies have attempted to target joint attention. In this study, joint attention behaviors were taught to children with autism using a behavior modification procedure. A multiple-baseline design was implemented to evaluate intervention effects. The following target behaviors were included in the intervention: 1) Responding to showing, pointing, and gaze shifting of adult; 2) Coordinated gaze shifting (i.e., coordinated joint attention); and 3) Pointing (with the purpose of sharing, not requesting). Generalization to setting and parent, follow-up sessions, and social validation measures were also analyzed. Joint attention behaviors were effectively trained and targeted behaviors generalized to other settings. In addition, positive changes were noted by naive observers using social validation measures. Integrating joint attention training into existing interventions may be important for children with autism. In addition, training parents in these techniques may help to maintain joint attention skills outside of the treatment setting.","Whalen Christina, Schreibman Laura","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","Attention, Autistic Disorder, Behavior Therapy, California, Child Development, Child, Preschool, Humans, Play and Playthings, Reproducibility of Results, Social Behavior",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12635974,"Autism Spectrum Therapies, Los Angeles, CA 90034, USA. cdallaire@autismtherapies.com"

A follow-up was conducted 12 months later (mean age = 35 months). There was some evidence that the parent training group made more progress in language development than the local services group. However, the present pilot study was compromised by several factors: a reliance on parental report to measure language, non-matching of the groups on initial IQ, and a lack of systematic checking regarding the implementation of the parent training intervention. Furthermore, three parents in the local services group commenced intensive, home-based behavioural intervention during the course of the study.

Parallel with this clinical research, we developed electrophysiological procedures adapted to the pathology of autism. In this paper, we report the utilization of an original multivariate descriptive statistical approach (correspondence analysis followed by cluster analysis) that allowed us to identify different bioclinical profiles using these clinical and electrophysiological data conjointly. These profiles are believed to be evidence for different underlying cerebral dysfunctions. This procedure proved effective in identifying two main bioclinical dimensions in a population of 145 developmentally disordered children. These dimensions reflect the association of intellectual impairment and centroparietal electrophysiological reactivity on the one hand, and autistic behavior and temporal electrophysiological reactivity on the other. This study, performed on a large population of children using objective methods of data analysis, provides validation of numerous multidisciplinary studies of autism and other developmental disorders carried out on small samples of children.","Roux S, Bruneau N, Garreau B, Guérin P, Adrien J L, Dansart P, Gomot M, Barthélémy C",Biological psychiatry,"Autistic Disorder, Brain, Child, Child, Preschool, Cluster Analysis, Developmental Disabilities, Electroencephalography, Electrophysiology, Evoked Potentials, Auditory, Female, Humans, Infant, Intelligence Tests, Male, Multivariate Analysis",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9426885,"INSERM U316, CHU Bretonneau, Tours, France."

Cerebrospinal fluid inositol has been reported as decreased in depression. A double-blind controlled trial of 12 g daily of inositol in 28 depressed patients for four weeks was performed. Significant overall benefit for inositol compared to placebo was found at week 4 on the Hamilton Depression Scale. No changes were noted in hematology, kidney or liver function. Since many antidepressants are effective in panic disorder, twenty-one patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia completed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, four week, random-assignment crossover treatment trial of inositol 12 g per day. Frequency and severity of panic attacks and severity of agoraphobia declined significantly with inositol compared to placebo. Side-effects were minimal. Since serotonin re-uptake inhibitors benefit obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and inositol is reported to reverse desensitization of serotonin receptors, thirteen patients with OCD completed a double-blind controlled crossover trial of 18 g inositol or placebo for six weeks each. Inositol significantly reduced scores of OCD symptoms compared with placebo. A controlled double-blind crossover trial of 12 g daily of inositol for a month in twelve anergic schizophrenic patients, did not show any beneficial effects. A double-blind controlled crossover trial of 6 g of inositol daily vs. glucose for one month each was carried out in eleven Alzheimer patients, with on clearly significant therapeutic effects. Antidepressant drugs have been reported to improve attention deficit disorder (ADDH) with hyperactivity symptomatology. We studied oral inositol in children with ADDH in a double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled manner. Eleven children, mean age 8.9 +/- 3.6 years were enrolled in an eight week trial of inositol or placebo at a dose of 200 mg/kg body weight. Results show a trend for aggravation of the syndrome with myo-inositol as compared to placebo. Recent studies suggest that serotonin re-uptake inhibitors are helpful in at least some symptoms of autism. However a controlled double-blind crossover trial of inositol 200 mg/kg per day showed no benefit in nine children with autism. Cholinergic agonists have been reported to ameliorate electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)-induced memory impairment. Inositol metabolism is involved in the second messenger system for several muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Inositol 6 g daily was given in a crossover-double-blind manner for five days before the fifth or sixth ECT to a series of twelve patients, without effect.

Accelerating research interest in the role of antecedents reveals that a large array of stimulus variables can influence the rate of problem behavior. Indeed, the variety of these stimuli is so great that it is sometimes possible to overlook specific stimulus variables during initial assessment. The present study shows that a failure to identify these very specific (idiosyncratic) stimulus variables is serious because their presence can systematically alter the outcomes of functional analyses that are designed to assess the motivation of problem behavior. Guidelines are therefore discussed concerning when to suspect that idiosyncratic stimuli might be acting to influence assessment data, thereby promoting a search for additional stimulus variables whose identification can aid in improving the design of functional analysis conditions.","Carr E G, Yarbrough S C, Langdon N A",Journal of applied behavior analysis,"Adolescent, Adult, Aggression, Autistic Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Conditioning, Operant, Cross-Over Studies, Cues, Developmental Disabilities, Humans, Individuality, Longitudinal Studies, Male, Observation, Precipitating Factors, Self-Injurious Behavior, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9433791,"Department of Psychology, State University of New York, Stony Brook 11794-2500, USA."

More recent studies are demonstrating that implementing these strategies within a parent training format may produce collateral effects in other areas of family life. The present experiment assessed collateral effects of two very different parent training paradigms during unstructured dinnertime interactions in the family setting. One paradigm focused on teaching individual target behaviors (ITB) serially, and the other focused on a recently developed naturalistic paradigm that teaches the pivotal responses (PRT) of motivation and responsivity to multiple cues. Two groups of families were randomly assigned to each of the parent training conditions. Pretraining and post-parent-training videotapes of dinnertime interactions were scored in a random order across four interactional scales (level of happiness, interest, stress, and style of communication). Results obtained for the four interactional scales showed that the families in both conditions initially scored in the neutral range, and the ITB training paradigm produced no significant influence on the interactions from pretraining to posttraining. In contrast, however the PRT parent training paradigm resulted in the families showing positive interactions on all four scales, with the parent-child interactions rated as happier, the parents more interested in the interaction, the interaction less stressful, and the communication style as more positive.","Koegel R L, Bimbela A, Schreibman L",Journal of autism and developmental disorders,"Autistic Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Child, Child, Preschool, Combined Modality Therapy, Family, Family Therapy, Female, Humans, Male, Motivation, Parents, Personality Assessment, Social Environment, Socialization, Treatment Outcome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8792265,"Counseling/Clinical/School Psychology Program, Graduate School of Education, University of California, Santa Barbara 93106-9490, USA."

Twelve autistic patients ranging from 7 to 15 years, diagnosed according to DSM-III-R, entered a double-blind crossover study with NAL at the doses of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mg/kg every 48 hours. The behavioural evaluation was conducted using the specific BSE and CARS rating scales NAL treatment produced a significant reduction of the autistic symptomatology in seven (""responders"") out of 12 children. The behavioural improvement was accompanied by alterations in the distribution of the major lymphocyte subsets, with a significant increase of the T-helper-inducers (CD4+CD8-) and a significant reduction of the T-cytotoxic-suppressor (CD4-CD8+) resulting in a normalization of the CD4/CD8 ratio. Changes in natural killer cells and activity were inversely related to plasma beta-endorphin levels. It is suggested that the mechanisms underlying opioid-immune interactions are altered in this population of autistic children and that an immunological screening may have prognostic value for the pharmacological therapy with opiate antagonists.","Scifo R, Cioni M, Nicolosi A, Batticane N, Tirolo C, Testa N, Quattropani M C, Morale M C, Gallo F, Marchetti B",Annali dell'Istituto superiore di sanita,"Adolescent, Antigens, CD, Autistic Disorder, Behavior, Child, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Lymphocyte Subsets, Male, Naltrexone, Narcotic Antagonists, beta-Endorphin",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9028057,"Servizio di Psichiatria, Istituto OASI per lo Studio del Ritardo Mentale e l'Involuzione Cerebrale, Troina (Enna), Italy."

Because these brain areas are involved centrally in the acquisition and performance in classical eye-blink conditioning, this study evaluated conditioning in 11 persons with autism. Compared to matched controls, persons with autism learned the task faster but performed short-latency, high-amplitude conditioned responses. In addition, differences in learning the extinction rates systematically varied with age thus suggesting a developmental conditioning abnormality in autism. The observed pattern of eye-blink conditioning may indicate that persons with autism have the ability to rapidly associate paired stimuli but, depending on processing of certain contextual information, have impairments in modulating the timing and topography of the learned responses. This abnormality may relate to deviant cerebellar-hippocampal interactions.

Cross-over effects of a dopamine agonist and an antagonist].,1992-01-01,"In infantile autism, the serotoninergic (5-HT) hypothesis is corroborated by biological dosages and therapeutic effects of fenfluramine which decrease blood serotonin. However other drugs, such as dopaminergic agonists or antagonists, have therapeutic effects. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that two dopaminergic (DA) drugs have a similar 5-HT effect underlying the therapeutic efficiency. We evaluated in a randomized, double-blind and cross-over study, the effects of a DA agonist (bromocriptine) and a DA antagonist (amisulpride) on platelet 5-HT in infantile autism. The prolactinemia, reflecting the DA action, has been also measured. Nine children, aged from 4 to 13 years, according to the DSM III for infantile autism, received either drug in a random order during four weeks with an in-between placebo period of six weeks. The dosages of platelet 5-HT and serum prolactin were carried out at the beginning and at the end of every phase of treatment (active or placebo) with radioenzymology and radioimmunoassay methods respectively. The principal results on serum prolactin show neither order x treatment interaction, nor order effect but a significant treatment effect (p < 0.01): amisulpride increases serum prolactin whereas bromocriptine decreases according to the usual data. About platelet 5-HT, there is neither order x treatment interaction, nor treatment effect but a significant order effect (p < 0.01). Both drugs increase platelet 5-HT in the first phase of treatment.

This 12-week study has an add-on, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled design of treatment with memantine, including an up-titration phase (forced flexible dose design, 5-15 mg/day), in patients aged 6-17 years and 9 months with obsessive-compulsive disorder or autism spectrum disorder. It is planned to include patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (N = 50) or autism spectrum disorder (N = 50) across four centres in three European countries. Patients will be randomly assigned to memantine or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Primary objectives are the investigation of the effectiveness of memantine in paediatric patients for improving symptoms of compulsivity (primary outcome measure: total score on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale) and to explore its tolerability and safety. Secondary objectives are to explore the effects of memantine at the level of structure, function and biochemistry of the fronto-striatal circuits, and to collect blood for genetic analyses and biomarkers. Tertiary objectives are to explore the role of new candidate genes and pathways for compulsivity by linking genes to clinical phenotypes, response to treatment, neurocognitive test performance, and key structural and functional neuroimaging measures of the fronto-striatal circuits and to explore biomarkers/proteomics for compulsivity traits. This study is part of the large, translational project TACTICS ( http://www.tactics-project.eu/ ) that is funded by the European Union and investigates the neural, genetic and molecular factors involved in the pathogenesis of compulsivity. Its results will provide clinically relevant solid information on potential new mechanisms and medication treatment in obsessive-compulsive and autism spectrum disorders.

31042696,10.1038/S41386-019-0402-Z,Effects of MDMA on attention to positive social cues and pleasantness of affective touch.,2019-09-01,"The psychostimulant drug ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) reportedly produces distinctive feelings of empathy and closeness with others. MDMA increases social behavior in animal models and has shown promise in psychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). How it produces these prosocial effects is not known. This behavioral and psychophysiological study examined the effects of MDMA, compared with the prototypical stimulant methamphetamine (MA), on two measures of social behavior in healthy young adults: (i) responses to socially relevant, ""affective"" touch, and (ii) visual attention to emotional faces. Men and women (N = 36) attended four sessions in which they received MDMA (0.75 or 1.5 mg/kg), MA (20 mg), or a placebo in randomized order under double-blind conditions. Responses to experienced and observed affective touch (i.e., being touched or watching others being touched) were assessed using facial electromyography (EMG), a proxy of affective state. Responses to emotional faces were assessed using electrooculography (EOG) in a measure of attentional bias. Subjective ratings were also included. We hypothesized that MDMA, but not MA, would enhance the ratings of pleasantness and psychophysiological responses to affective touch and increase attentional bias toward positive facial expressions. Consistent with this, we found that MDMA, but not MA, selectively enhanced ratings of pleasantness of experienced affective touch. Neither drug altered the ratings of pleasantness of observed touch. On the EOG measure of attentional bias, MDMA, but not MA, increased attention toward happy faces. These results provide new evidence that MDMA can enhance the experience of positive social interactions; in this case, pleasantness of physical touch and attentional bias toward positive facial expressions. The findings are consistent with evidence that the prosocial effects are unique to MDMA relative to another stimulant. Understanding the behavioral and neurobiological processes underlying the distinctive social effects of MDMA is a key step to developing the drug for psychiatric disorders.","Bershad Anya K, Mayo Leah M, Van Hedger Kathryne, McGlone Francis, Walker Susannah C, de Wit Harriet",Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,"Adolescent, Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors, Adult, Affect, Attention, Attentional Bias, Cues, Double-Blind Method, Electromyography, Electrooculography, Facial Muscles, Female, Healthy Volunteers, Humans, Male, Methamphetamine, N-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, Pleasure, Social Behavior, Touch Perception, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042696,"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.; School of Natural Sciences and Psychology, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, UK.; Center for Social and Affective Neuroscience, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden.; Department of Clinical Neurological Sciences, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, UK.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA. hdew@uchicago.edu."

The search for psychotherapeutic options for autistic individuals is imperative considering the lack of effective conventional treatments for mental health diagnoses that are common in this population. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) involving the administration of MDMA in clinical trials have been rare and non-life threatening. To date, MDMA has been administered to over 1133 individuals for research purposes without the occurrence of unexpected drug-related SAEs that require expedited reporting per FDA regulations. Now that safety parameters for limited use of MDMA in clinical settings have been established, a case can be made to further develop MDMA-assisted therapeutic interventions that could support autistic adults in increasing social adaptability among the typically developing population. As in the case with classic hallucinogens and other psychedelic drugs, MDMA catalyzes shifts toward openness and introspection that do not require ongoing administration to achieve lasting benefits. This infrequent dosing mitigates adverse event frequency and improves the risk/benefit ratio of MDMA, which may provide a significant advantage over medications that require daily dosing. Consequently, clinicians could employ new treatment models for social anxiety or similar types of distress administering MDMA on one to several occasions within the context of a supportive and integrative psychotherapy protocol.","Danforth Alicia L, Struble Christopher M, Yazar-Klosinski Berra, Grob Charles S",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,"Adult, Anxiety Disorders, Autistic Disorder, Double-Blind Method, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, N-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, Patient Selection, Pilot Projects, Prospective Studies, Psychotropic Drugs, Research Design, Social Perception",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25818246,"Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute, Torrance, CA, United States.

In the present study, we aimed at exploring ADHD and criminality. We estimated the prevalence of ADHD among longer-term prison inmates, described symptoms and cognitive functioning, and compared findings with ADHD among psychiatric outpatients and healthy controls. At Norrtälje Prison, we approached 315 male inmates for screening of childhood ADHD by the Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS-25) and for present ADHD by the Adult ADHD Self-Report Screener (ASRS-Screener). The response rate was 62%. Further, we assessed 34 inmates for ADHD and coexisting disorders. Finally, we compared findings with 20 adult males with ADHD, assessed at a psychiatric outpatient clinic and 18 healthy controls. The estimated prevalence of adult ADHD among longer-term inmates was 40%. Only 2 out of 30 prison inmates confirmed with ADHD had received a diagnosis of ADHD during childhood, despite most needed health services and educational support. All subjects reported lifetime substance use disorder (SUD) where amphetamine was the most common drug. Mood and anxiety disorders were present among half of subjects; autism spectrum disorder (ASD) among one fourth and psychopathy among one tenth. Personality disorders were common; almost all inmates presented conduct disorder (CD) before antisocial personality disorder (APD). Prison inmates reported more ADHD symptoms during both childhood and adulthood, compared with ADHD psychiatric outpatients. Further, analysis of executive functions after controlling for IQ showed both ADHD groups performed poorer than controls on working memory tests. Besides, on a continuous performance test, the ADHD prison group displayed poorer results compared with both other groups. This study suggested ADHD to be present among 40% of adult male longer-term prison inmates. Further, ADHD and coexisting disorders, such as SUD, ASD, personality disorders, mood- and anxiety disorders, severely affected prison inmates with ADHD. Besides, inmates showed poorer executive functions also when controlling for estimated IQ compared with ADHD among psychiatric outpatients and controls.

Light-adapted electroretinograms were recorded from 61 adults (38 males and 23 females; <i>n</i> = 22 ASD) in response to three stimulus protocols: (1) the standard white flash, (2) the standard 30 Hz flickering protocol, and (3) the photopic negative response protocol.

At baseline (placebo), the a-wave amplitudes in response to single white flashes were more prominent in ASD, relative to typically developed (TD) participants. Arbaclofen was associated with a decrease in the a-wave amplitude in ASD, but an increase in TD, eliminating the group difference observed at baseline. The extent of this arbaclofen-elicited shift significantly correlated with the arbaclofen-elicited shift in cortical responses to auditory stimuli as measured by using an electroencephalogram in our prior study and with broader autistic traits measured with the autism quotient across the whole cohort. Hence, GABA-dependent differences in retinal light processing in ASD appear to be an accessible component of a wider autistic difference in the central processing of sensory information, which may be upstream of more complex autistic phenotypes.","Huang Qiyun, Ellis Claire L, Leo Shaun M, Velthuis Hester, Pereira Andreia C, Dimitrov Mihail, Ponteduro Francesca M, Wong Nichol M L, Daly Eileen, Murphy Declan G M, Mahroo Omar A, McAlonan Gráinne M",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,"Male, Adult, Female, Humans, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Retina, Electroencephalography, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid, Electroretinography",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38467434,"Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London SE5 8AF, United Kingdom grainne.mcalonan@kcl.ac.uk.; Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London EC1V 2PD, United Kingdom.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London SE5 8AF, United Kingdom."

As part of a study of potential biosignatures of GABA function in ASD to inform future clinical trials, we evaluated the role of GABA in auditory repetition suppression in 66 adults (n = 28 with ASD). Neurophysiological responses (temporal and frequency domains) to repetitive standard tones and novel deviants presented in an oddball paradigm were compared after double-blind, randomized administration of placebo, 15 or 30 mg of arbaclofen (STX209), a GABA type B (GABA<sub>B</sub>) receptor agonist. We first established that temporal mismatch negativity was comparable between participants with ASD and those with typical development (TD). Next, we showed that temporal and spectral responses to repetitive standards were suppressed relative to responses to deviants in the two groups, but suppression was significantly weaker in individuals with ASD at baseline. Arbaclofen reversed weaker suppression of spectral responses in ASD but disrupted suppression in TD. A post hoc analysis showed that arbaclofen-elicited shift in suppression was correlated with autistic symptomatology measured using the Autism Quotient across the entire group, though not in the smaller sample of the ASD and TD group when examined separately.

Currently no pharmacological interventions have been shown to be effective for improving social communication in autism. Previous trials have indicated the potential of arbaclofen for improving social function among autistic children and adolescents with fluent speech. The AIMS2TRIALS-Clinical Trial 1 (AIMS-CT1) will examine whether arbaclofen is superior to placebo in improving social function and other secondary outcomes over 16 weeks, along with safety and tolerability profiles. <b>Methods:</b> AIMS-CT1 is an international, multi-site, double-blind, parallel group Phase II randomized clinical trial. It will include 130 males and females aged 5:0-17:11 years, with a diagnosis of ASD and fluent speech. Eligible participants will be randomized on a ratio of 1:1 for a 16-week treatment period.

31451579,10.1523/Jneurosci.0836-19.2019,GABAergic Inhibition Gates Perceptual Awareness During Binocular Rivalry.,2019-10-16,"Binocular rivalry is a classic experimental tool to probe the neural machinery of perceptual awareness. During rivalry, perception alternates between the two eyes, and the ebb and flow of perception is modeled to rely on the strength of inhibitory interactions between competitive neuronal populations in visual cortex. As a result, rivalry has been suggested as a noninvasive perceptual marker of inhibitory signaling in visual cortex, and its putative disturbance in psychiatric conditions, including autism. Yet, direct evidence causally implicating inhibitory signaling in the dynamics of binocular rivalry is currently lacking. We previously found that people with higher GABA levels in visual cortex, measured using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, have stronger perceptual suppression during rivalry. Here, we present direct causal tests of the impact of GABAergic inhibition on rivalry dynamics, and the contribution of specific GABA receptors to these dynamics. In a crossover pharmacological design with male and female adult participants, we found that drugs that modulate the two dominant GABA receptor types in the brain, GABA<sub>A</sub> (clobazam) and GABA<sub>B</sub> (arbaclofen), increase perceptual suppression during rivalry relative to a placebo. Crucially, these results could not be explained by changes in reaction times or response criteria, as determined through rivalry simulation trials, suggesting a direct and specific influence of GABA on perceptual suppression. A full replication study of the GABA<sub>B</sub> modulator reinforces these findings. These results provide causal evidence for a link between the strength of inhibition in the brain and perceptual suppression during rivalry and have implications for psychiatric conditions including autism.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How does the brain accomplish perceptual gating? Here we use a direct and causal pharmacological manipulation to present insight into the neural machinery of a classic illusion of perceptual awareness: binocular rivalry. We show that drugs that increase GABAergic inhibition in the brain, clobazam (GABA<sub>A</sub> modulator) and arbaclofen (GABA<sub>B</sub> modulator), increase perceptual suppression during rivalry relative to a placebo. These results present the first causal link between GABAergic inhibition and binocular rivalry in humans, complementing classic models of binocular rivalry, and have implications for our understanding of psychiatric conditions, such as autism, where binocular rivalry is posited as a behavioral marker of disruptions in inhibitory signaling in the brain.","Mentch Jeff, Spiegel Alina, Ricciardi Catherine, Robertson Caroline E",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,"Adolescent, Adult, Awareness, Baclofen, Clobazam, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Female, GABA-A Receptor Agonists, GABA-B Receptor Agonists, Humans, Male, Vision, Binocular, Visual Perception, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31451579,"School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, 21205, and.; Clinical Research Center, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139.; Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755, caroline.e.robertson@dartmouth.edu.; Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755."

We aimed to appraise the magnitude of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for irritability in ASD without any restrictions in terms of eligible interventions. We systematically searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science until April 15, 2023. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a parallel design that examined the efficacy of interventions for the treatment of irritability in patients of any age with ASD without any restrictions in terms of eligible interventions. We performed a random-effects meta-analysis by pooling effect sizes as Hedges' g. We classified assessed interventions as follows: pharmacological monotherapy, risperidone plus adjuvant therapy versus risperidone monotherapy, non-pharmacological intervention, and dietary intervention. We utilized the Cochrane tool to evaluate the risk of bias in each study and the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for each meta-analyzed intervention. Out of 5640 references, we identified 60 eligible articles with 45 different kinds of interventions, including 3531 participants, of which 80.9% were males (mean age [SD] = 8.79 [3.85]). For pharmacological monotherapy, risperidone (Hedges' g - 0.857, 95% CI - 1.263 to - 0.451, certainty of evidence: high) and aripiprazole (Hedges' g - 0.559, 95% CI - 0.767 to - 0.351, certainty of evidence: high) outperformed placebo. Among the non-pharmacological interventions, parent training (Hedges' g - 0.893, 95% CI - 1.184 to - 0.602, certainty of evidence: moderate) showed a significant result. None of the meta-analyzed interventions yielded significant effects among risperidone + adjuvant therapy and dietary supplementation. However, several novel molecules in augmentation to risperidone outperformed risperidone monotherapy, yet from one RCT each. First, various tools have been utilized to measure the irritability in ASD, which may contribute to the heterogeneity of the outcomes. Second, meta-analyses for each intervention included only a small number of studies and participants. Only risperidone, aripiprazole among pharmacological interventions, and parent training among non-pharmacological interventions can be recommended for irritability in ASD. As an augmentation to risperidone, several novel treatments show promising effects, but further RCTs are needed to replicate findings.

Despite its high prevalence, reaching 1/54 children and 1/45 adults in the United States, no pharmacological treatment is still directed to core symptoms of ASD, encompassing social and communication deficits, repetitive behaviors, restricted interests, and abnormal sensory processing. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art of psychopharmacological therapy available today for ASD in children and adolescents, in order to foster best practices and to organize new strategies for future research. To date, atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone and aripiprazole represent the first line of intervention for hyperactivity, impulsivity, agitation, temper outbursts or aggression towards self or others. Tricyclic antidepressants are less prescribed because of uncertain efficacy and important side effects. SSRIs, especially fluoxetine and sertraline, may be effective in treating repetitive behaviors (anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms) and irritability/agitation, while mirtazapine is more helpful with sleep problems. Low doses of buspirone have shown some efficacy on restrictive and repetitive behaviors in combination with behavioral interventions. Stimulants, and to a lesser extent atomoxetine, are effective in reducing hyperactivity, inattention and impulsivity also in comorbid ASD-ADHD, although with somewhat lower efficacy and greater incidence of side effects compared to idiopathic ADHD. Clonidine and guanfacine display some efficacy on hyperactivity and stereotypic behaviors. For several other drugs, case reports and open-label studies suggest possible efficacy, but no randomized controlled trial has yet been performed. Research in the pediatric psychopharmacology of ASD is still faced with at least two major hurdles: (a) Great interindividual variability in clinical response and side effect sensitivity is observed in the ASD population. This low level of predictability would benefit from symptom-specific treatment algorithms and from biomarkers to support drug choice; (b) To this date, no psychoactive drug appears to directly ameliorate core autism symptoms, although some indirect improvement has been reported with several drugs, once the comorbid target symptom is abated.","Persico Antonio M, Ricciardello Arianna, Lamberti Marco, Turriziani Laura, Cucinotta Francesca, Brogna Claudia, Vitiello Benedetto, Arango Celso",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,"Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic, Antipsychotic Agents, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Central Nervous System Stimulants, Child, Clinical Trials as Topic, Humans, Psychopharmacology, Psychotropic Drugs, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33857522,"Child & Adolescent Psychiatry Unit, ""Franz Tappeiner"" Hospital, Merano (BZ), Italy.; Interdepartmental Program ""Autism 0-90"", ""G.

This can have major implications in child development, receptivity to behavioral therapy, as well as child and caregiver well-being. A systematic review and network meta-analysis were conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of atypical antipsychotics in treating irritability in these patients. Studies were identified from Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO from inception to March 2018. The clinical trials database was reviewed. Studies were included if they were a double-blind, randomized controlled trial utilizing the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability (ABC-I) to measure the efficacy of atypical antipsychotic monotherapy. Data extraction was carried out following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses for network meta-analysis guidelines. The main outcome was the reduction in irritability score using the ABC-I subscale from baseline. Eight trials comparing four interventions-risperidone, aripiprazole, lurasidone, and placebo in 878 patients, were included. Both risperidone and aripiprazole had significantly reduced ABC-I scores than placebo. Estimates of mean differences (95% credible intervals) were risperidone, -6.89 (-11.14, -2.54); aripiprazole, -6.62 (-10.88, -2.22); and lurasidone, -1.61 (-9.50, 6.23). Both risperidone and aripiprazole had similar safety. There were only eight studies included in the analysis, however, sample sizes were not small.

Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic approved for pediatric use in schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder, and autistic disorder. Adult studies have evaluated aripiprazole's effects on electrocardiograms, but no pediatric studies have been published to date. Electrocardiographic data were collected from children and adolescents participating in a 14-week, prospective, open-label study (n=25) of aripiprazole for irritability in pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified and Asperger's disorder. A 12-lead electrocardiogram was obtained at the baseline and end point visits. The electrocardiograms were evaluated for abnormal findings, and the PR, QRS, QT(c), and RR intervals were recorded. The QT interval was corrected using Bazett's, United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Pharmacology Division, and Fridericia's formulas. Twenty-four subjects received both baseline and posttreatment electrocardiograms. The mean age was 8.6 years (range 5-17 years). The average final aripiprazole dose was 7.8 mg/day (range 2.5-15 mg/day). There were no significant differences noted with the PR, QRS, RR, and QT(c) intervals after aripiprazole therapy. Also, there was no significant correlation between the dose given and the percent change in the QT(c). No post-treatment QT(c) exceeded 440 ms. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic evaluation of the cardiac effects of aripiprazole in children and adolescents. The results are consistent with previously published literature in adults that aripiprazole has no significant cardiac effects and can be deemed a low risk for causing sudden death. It will be important to confirm these findings in a randomized controlled trial.","Ho Jason G, Caldwell Randall L, McDougle Christopher J, Orsagh-Yentis Danielle K, Erickson Craig A, Posey David J, Stigler Kimberly A",Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology,"Adolescent, Antipsychotic Agents, Aripiprazole, Asperger Syndrome, Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Child, Preschool, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Electrocardiography, Female, Humans, Irritable Mood, Male, Pilot Projects, Piperazines, Prospective Studies, Quinolones",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22849533,"Section of Pediatric Cardiology, Department of Pediatrics, James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202-5200, USA."
22548111,,Review of the pharmacotherapy of irritability of autism.,2012-05-01,"To review the randomized controlled trial data regarding pharmacotherapy of irritability of autism. A LITERATURE REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED USING THE MEDLINE SEARCH TERMS: 'autism' OR 'autism spectrum disorder' with the following limits: Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), human trials, English language. Additional articles were identified from reference information. Trials involving nutritional supplements, hormones or drugs not approved by either Health Canada or the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were excluded from analysis. Twenty-three RCTs that met criteria were identified. The greatest number of RCTs involved risperidone, with six of seven placebo-controlled risperidone trials reporting statistically significant improvements on the primary outcome measure. Two aripiprazole RCTs and one olanzapine RCT reported statistically significant improvement in primary outcome measures. Haloperidol was superior to both clomipramine and placebo in a head-to-head crossover trial, while risperidone was superior to haloperidol for treatment of behavioural symptoms in a separate head-to-head trial. Clonidine, methylphenidate, valproate and levocarnitine monotherapy were superior to placebo in single RCTs, while adjunctive treatments cyproheptadine, pentoxifylline and topiramate were superior to placebo in small studies when given in combination with an antipsychotic. Adverse events from RCTs were summarized, including weight gain and metabolic effects, if available. The bulk of positive RCT evidence for the pharmacotherapy of irritability of autism pertains to FDA approved antipsychotics risperidone and aripiprazole. RCTs supporting efficacy of several alternative and adjunctive agents may afford additional treatment options when optimal antipsychotic doses fail to control symptoms or cause intolerable adverse effects. Behavioural therapy should be employed where possible either before, or in addition to pharmacotherapy.","Elbe Dean, Lalani Zaahira",Journal of the Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry = Journal de l'Academie canadienne de psychiatrie de l'enfant et de l'adolescent,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22548111,"Children's and Women's Mental Health Programs, BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia."

Many children actually show a decline in adaptive skills compared with age mates over time. This 24-week, three-site, controlled clinical trial randomized 124 children (4 through 13 years of age) with PDDs and serious behavioral problems to medication alone (MED; n = 49; risperidone 0.5 to 3.5 mg/day; if ineffective, switch to aripiprazole was permitted) or a combination of medication plus parent training (PT) (COMB; n = 75). Parents of children in COMB received an average of 11.4 PT sessions. Standard scores and Age-Equivalent scores on Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales were the outcome measures of primary interest. Seventeen subjects did not have a post-randomization Vineland assessment. Thus, we used a mixed model with outcome conditioned on the baseline Vineland scores. Both groups showed improvement over the 24-week trial on all Vineland domains. Compared with MED, Vineland Socialization and Adaptive Composite Standard scores showed greater improvement in the COMB group (p = .01 and .05, and effect sizes = 0.35 and 0.22, respectively). On Age Equivalent scores, Socialization and Communication domains showed greater improvement in COMB versus MED (p = .03 and 0.05, and effect sizes = 0.33 and 0.14, respectively). Using logistic regression, children in the COMB group were twice as likely to make at least 6 months' gain (equal to the passage of time) in the Vineland Communication Age Equivalent score compared with MED (p = .02). After controlling for IQ, this difference was no longer significant. Reduction of serious maladaptive behavior promotes improvement in adaptive behavior. Medication plus PT shows modest additional benefit over medication alone.

19718428,,Focus on aripiprazole: a review of its use in child and adolescent psychiatry.,2009-08-01,"To review published literature regarding aripiprazole in child and adolescent psychiatry. A literature review was conducted using the medline search term: 'aripiprazole' with limits: Human trials, English language, All Child (aged 0-18 years). Additional articles were identified from reference information and poster presentation data. Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic which was recently approved for use in Canada, but has been available for several years in the United States. Pharmacologically, aripiprazole is a partial agonist at D(2) and 5-HT(1A) receptors and an antagonist at 5-HT(2A) receptors. Randomized controlled trial data is available showing efficacy for aripiprazole in the treatment of children and adolescents with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and behavioural problems associated with autism. Open-label evidence is also available for use of aripiprazole in other disorders such as tic disorders, aggression and disruptive behavior disorders. Unlike some other available atypical antipsychotics, there does not appear to be any effect on QTc interval on the electrocardiogram. Adverse effects including extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), akathisia, sedation, headache, nausea were significant in clinical trials in children and adolescents. The possibility of aripiprazole causing tardive dyskinesia cannot be excluded. In this population, aripiprazole appears to have minimal impact on the metabolic profile compared to most other atypical antipsychotics, with minimal changes in weight or body mass index, no significant changes in glucose or lipid metabolism, and a decrease in serum prolactin. Aripiprazole may represent an important alternative for some children and adolescents who have experienced poor efficacy or significant metabolic adverse effects with their current antipsychotic treatment regimen.","Greenaway Masa'il, Elbe Dean",Journal of the Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry = Journal de l'Academie canadienne de psychiatrie de l'enfant et de l'adolescent,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19718428,"Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, BC."

Sixty-four children (3-12 years) with moderate-to-severe irritability symptoms of ASD were included. We used the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Edition (ABC-C) for the outcome measures on each of the follow-up visits (weeks 0, 5, and 10).

We aimed to assess the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of balovaptan, a vasopressin 1a receptor antagonist, versus placebo in autistic adults. V1aduct was a phase 3, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, conducted at 46 sites across six countries (the USA, the UK, France, Italy, Spain, and Canada). Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older with an intelligence quotient (IQ) of 70 or higher, and met the criteria for moderate-to-severe autism spectrum disorder (DSM-5 and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule). Participants were randomly allocated (1:1), with an independent interactive voice or web-based response system, to receive balovaptan (10 mg) or placebo daily for 24 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by an individual's baseline Vineland-II two-domain composite (2DC) score (<60 or ≥60), sex, region (North America or rest of world), and age (<25 years or ≥25 years). Participants, study site personnel, and the sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in Vineland-II 2DC score (the mean composite score across the Vineland-II socialisation and communication domains) at week 24. The primary analysis was done with ANCOVA in the intention-to-treat population. The V1aduct study was terminated for futility after around 50% of participants completed the week 24 visit. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03504917). Between Aug 8, 2018, and July 1, 2020, 540 people were screened for eligibility, of whom 322 were allocated to receive balovaptan (164 [51%]) or placebo (158 [49%]). One participant from the balovaptan group was not treated before trial termination and was excluded from the analysis. 60 participants in the balovaptan group and 55 in the placebo group discontinued treatment before week 24. The sample consisted of 64 (20%) women and 257 (80%) men, with 260 (81%) participants from North America and 61 (19%) from Europe. At baseline, mean age was 27·6 years (SD 9·7) and mean IQ score was 104·8 (18·1). Two (1%) participants were American Indian or Alaska Native, eight (2%) were Asian, 15 (5%) were Black or African American, 283 (88%) were White, four (1%) were of multiple races, and nine (3%) were of unknown race. Mean baseline Vineland-II 2DC scores were 67·2 (SD 15·3) in the balovaptan group and 66·2 (17·7) in the placebo group. The interim futility analysis showed no improvement for balovaptan versus placebo in terms of Vineland-II 2DC score at week 24 compared with baseline, with a least-squares mean change of 2·91 (SE 1·52) in the balovaptan group (n=79) and 4·75 (1·60) in the placebo group (n=71; estimated treatment difference -1·84 [95% CI -5·15 to 1·48]). In the final analysis, mean change from baseline in Vineland-II 2DC score at week 24 was 4·56 (SD 10·85) in the balovaptan group (n=111) and 6·83 (12·18) in the placebo group (n=99). Balovaptan was well tolerated, with similar proportions of participants with at least one adverse event in the balovaptan group (98 [60%] of 163) and placebo group (104 [66%] of 158). The most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis (14 [9%] in the balovaptan group and 19 [12%] in the placebo group), diarrhoea (11 [7%] and 14 [9%]), upper respiratory tract infection (ten [6%] and nine [6%]), insomnia (five [3%] and eight [5%]), oropharyngeal pain (five [3%] and eight [5%]), and dizziness (two [1%] and ten [6%]). Serious adverse events were reported for two (1%) participants in the balovaptan group (one each of suicidal ideation and schizoaffective disorder), and five (3%) participants in the placebo group (one each of suicidal ideation, panic disorder, limb abscess, urosepsis, colitis [in the same participant with urosepsis], and death by suicide). No treatment-related deaths occurred. Balovaptan did not improve social communication in autistic adults.

The endocannabinoid system (ECS) seems to play a role in social behavior and emotional processing while it also seems to play a role in those neuropsychiatric conditions showing social cognition impairments. Main plant cannabinoids delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) modulate the ECS and, due to their opposite effects, have been proposed as both cause and treatment for neuropsychiatric-related disorders such as schizophrenia, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The aim of this study was to test the effects of THC and CBD on social cognition abilities in chronic cannabis users. <b>Method:</b> Eighteen members from a cannabis social club were tested for social cognition effects under the effects of different full spectrum cannabis extracts containing either THC, CBD, THC+CBD, or placebo in a naturalistic randomized double-blind crossover placebo-controlled study. <b>Results:</b> Results showed that participants under the effects of THC showed lower cognitive empathy when compared with the effects of CBD but not when those were compared with THC+CBD or placebo. Also, participants showed higher cognitive ToM under the effects of CBD when compared with the effects of placebo, but not when those were compared with THC or THC+CBD. However, we did not find differences on the emotional scales for empathy or ToM. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study provides evidence for the interaction between the effects of THC and CBD and social cognition abilities in a naturalistic environment, which can be of special interest for the clinical practice of medical cannabis on neuropsychiatric disorders. We show for the first time that CBD can improve ToM abilities in chronic cannabis users. Our results might help to understand the role of the ECS in social cognition, and their association with psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia or autism. Finally, we demonstrate how reliable methodologies can be implemented in naturalistic environments to collect valid ecological evidence outside classic laboratory settings.","Sainz-Cort Alberto, Jimenez-Garrido Daniel, Muñoz-Marron Elena, Viejo-Sobera Raquel, Heeroma Joost, Bouso Jose Carlos",Cannabis and cannabinoid research,"Humans, Cannabidiol, Cannabinoids, Cannabis, Dronabinol, Hallucinogens, Social Cognition, Double-Blind Method, Cross-Over Studies",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35881851,"GH Medical, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; International Center of Ethnobotanic Education, Research and Service (ICEERS), Barcelona, Spain.; Faculty of Health Sciences, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC), Barcelona, Spain."
34210360,10.1186/S13229-021-00454-6,Modulation of striatal functional connectivity differences in adults with and without autism spectrum disorder in a single-dose randomized trial of cannabidivarin.,2021-07-01,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a high cost to affected individuals and society, but treatments for core symptoms are lacking. To expand intervention options, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of potential treatment targets, and their engagement, in the brain. For instance, the striatum (caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens) plays a central role during development and its (atypical) functional connectivity (FC) may contribute to multiple ASD symptoms. We have previously shown, in the adult autistic and neurotypical brain, the non-intoxicating cannabinoid cannabidivarin (CBDV) alters the balance of striatal 'excitatory-inhibitory' metabolites, which help regulate FC, but the effects of CBDV on (atypical) striatal FC are unknown. To examine this in a small pilot study, we acquired resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 28 men (15 neurotypicals, 13 ASD) on two occasions in a repeated-measures, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. We then used a seed-based approach to (1) compare striatal FC between groups and (2) examine the effect of pharmacological probing (600 mg CBDV/matched placebo) on atypical striatal FC in ASD. Visits were separated by at least 13 days to allow for drug washout. Compared to the neurotypicals, ASD individuals had lower FC between the ventral striatum and frontal and pericentral regions (which have been associated with emotion, motor, and vision processing). Further, they had higher intra-striatal FC and higher putamenal FC with temporal regions involved in speech and language. In ASD, CBDV reduced hyperconnectivity to the neurotypical level. Our findings should be considered in light of several methodological aspects, in particular our participant group (restricted to male adults), which limits the generalizability of our findings to the wider and heterogeneous ASD population. In conclusion, here we show atypical striatal FC with regions commonly associated with ASD symptoms. We further provide preliminary proof of concept that, in the adult autistic brain, acute CBDV administration can modulate atypical striatal circuitry towards neurotypical function. Future studies are required to determine whether modulation of striatal FC is associated with a change in ASD symptoms. clinicaltrials.gov, Identifier: NCT03537950.

However, the neural action of CBD, and its relevance to ASD, remains unclear. We and others have previously shown that response to drug challenge can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), but that pharmacological responsivity is atypical in ASD. We hypothesized that there would be a (different) fMRI response to CBD in ASD. To test this, task-free fMRI was acquired in 34 healthy men (half with ASD) following oral administration of 600 mg CBD or matched placebo (random order; double-blind administration). The 'fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations' (fALFF) was measured across the whole brain, and, where CBD significantly altered fALFF, we tested if functional connectivity (FC) of those regions was also affected by CBD. CBD significantly increased fALFF in the cerebellar vermis and the right fusiform gyrus. However, post-hoc within-group analyses revealed that this effect was primarily driven by the ASD group, with no significant change in controls. Within the ASD group only, CBD also significantly altered vermal FC with several of its subcortical (striatal) and cortical targets, but did not affect fusiform FC with other regions in either group. Our results suggest that, especially in ASD, CBD alters regional fALFF and FC in/between regions consistently implicated in ASD.

However, before launching large-scale clinical trials, a better understanding of the effects of CBD on brain would be desirable. Preclinical evidence suggests that one aspect of the polypharmacy of CBD is that it modulates brain excitatory glutamate and inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels, including in brain regions linked to ASD, such as the basal ganglia (BG) and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC). However, differences in glutamate and GABA pathways in ASD mean that the response to CBD in people with and without ASD may be not be the same. To test whether CBD 'shifts' glutamate and GABA levels; and to examine potential differences in this response in ASD, we used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure glutamate (Glx = glutamate + glutamine) and GABA+ (GABA + macromolecules) levels in 34 healthy men (17 neurotypicals, 17 ASD). Data acquisition commenced 2 h (peak plasma levels) after a single oral dose of 600 mg CBD or placebo. Test sessions were at least 13 days apart. Across groups, CBD increased subcortical, but decreased cortical, Glx. Across regions, CBD increased GABA+ in controls, but decreased GABA+ in ASD; the group difference in change in GABA + in the DMPFC was significant. Thus, CBD modulates glutamate-GABA systems, but prefrontal-GABA systems respond differently in ASD. Our results do not speak to the efficacy of CBD. Future studies should examine the effects of chronic administration on brain and behaviour, and whether acute brain changes predict longer-term response.","Pretzsch Charlotte Marie, Freyberg Jan, Voinescu Bogdan, Lythgoe David, Horder Jamie, Mendez Maria Andreina, Wichers Robert, Ajram Laura, Ivin Glynis, Heasman Martin, Edden Richard A E, Williams Steven, Murphy Declan G M, Daly Eileen, McAlonan Gráinne M",Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,"Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Basal Ganglia, Cannabidiol, Double-Blind Method, Glutamic Acid, Gray Matter, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Prefrontal Cortex, White Matter, Young Adult, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30758329,"Department of Neuroimaging Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; Russel H Morgan Department of Radiology and Radiological Science, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK.; South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust Pharmacy, London, UK.; Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK. grainne.mcalonan@kcl.ac.uk."

However, the molecular underpinnings of autistic-neurotypical serotonergic differences are challenging to access in vivo. Receptor-Enriched Analysis of functional Connectivity by Targets (REACT) has helped define molecular-enriched functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain networks based on a priori information about the spatial distribution of neurochemical systems from available PET templates. We used REACT to estimate the dominant fMRI signal related to the serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT) distribution during processing of aversive facial emotion in adults with and without ASD. We first predicted a group difference in baseline (placebo) functioning of this system. We next used a single 20 mg oral dose of citalopram, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, to test the hypothesis that network activity in people with and without ASD would respond differently to inhibition of SERT. To confirm the specificity of our findings, we also repeated the analysis with 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A and 5-HT4 receptor maps. Using REACT with the SERT map, we found a baseline group difference in the SERT-enriched response to faces in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. A single oral dose of citalopram 'shifted' the response in the ASD group towards the neurotypical baseline but did not alter response in the control group. Similar differences in SERT-enriched response were observed after controlling for other 5-HT maps. Our findings suggest that the SERT-enriched functional network is dynamically different in ASD during processing of socially relevant stimuli.

However, there is limited evidence to support this practice. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the impact of SSRIs on brain function abnormalities in ASD. It has been suggested that some core symptoms in ASD are underpinned by deficits in executive functioning (EF). Hence, we investigated the role of the SSRI citalopram on EF networks in 19 right-handed adult males with ASD and 19 controls who did not differ in gender, age, IQ or handedness. We performed pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare brain activity during two EF tasks (of response inhibition and sustained attention) after an acute dose of 20 mg citalopram or placebo using a randomised, double-blind, crossover design. Under placebo condition, individuals with ASD had abnormal brain activation in response inhibition regions, including inferior frontal, precentral and postcentral cortices and cerebellum. During sustained attention, individuals with ASD had abnormal brain activation in middle temporal cortex and (pre)cuneus. After citalopram administration, abnormal brain activation in inferior frontal cortex was 'normalised' and most of the other brain functional differences were 'abolished'. Also, within ASD, the degree of responsivity in inferior frontal and postcentral cortices to SSRI challenge was related to plasma serotonin levels. These findings suggest that citalopram can 'normalise' atypical brain activation during EF in ASD.

In patients treated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors there was a pronounced decrease of WB-5-HT, variable after 1 week and uniformly maximal after 4 weeks. The decrease of WB-5-HT after 1 week of serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment correlated negatively with clinical outcome after 12 weeks (r = -.61, p =.0006); hence, patients with slower WB-5-HT reactivity eventually responded better to treatment. Baseline WB-5-HT, but not WB-5-HT reactivity, was related to season. Depression, autistic traits, and previous serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment predicted nonresponse. A fast decrease of WB-5-HT was associated with poor clinical outcome. This may be related to faster serotonin efflux from platelets, which has previously been linked to autism.

Subjects had not tolerated or responded to other psychopharmacologic treatments (neuroleptics, methylphenidate, or desipramine). Teacher ratings on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist irritability, stereotypy, hyperactivity, and inappropriate speech factors were lower during treatment with clonidine than during treatment with placebo. Attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity: Comprehensive Teacher's Rating Scale ratings were not significantly improved during the study, except for oppositional behavior. Parent Conners Abbreviated Parent-Teacher Questionnaire ratings significantly improved during clonidine treatment. Clonidine led to increased ratings of the side effects of drowsiness and decreased activity. Clinician ratings (Children's Psychiatric Rating Scale Autism, Hyperactivity, Anger and Speech Deviance factors; Children's Global Assessment Scale; Clinical Global Impressions efficacy) of videotaped sessions were not significantly different between clonidine and placebo. Clonidine was modestly effective in the short-term treatment of irritability and hyperactivity in some children with autistic disorder.","Jaselskis C A, Cook E H, Fletcher K E, Leventhal B L",Journal of clinical psychopharmacology,"Ambulatory Care, Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity, Attitude to Health, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Clonidine, Double-Blind Method, Humans, Hypotension, Impulsive Behavior, Male, Parents, Placebos, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Sleep Stages, Teaching",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1479049,"Department of Psychiatry, University of Chicago, Illinois."
1548248,,"A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy of transdermal clonidine in autism.",1992-03-01,"Autistic individuals often exhibit hyperarousal behaviors (e.g., stereotyped body movements, self-stimulation, hypervigilance, and hyperactivity). Clonidine, an alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonist, has been shown to be effective in reducing impulsivity, inattention, and hyperactivity associated with attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of transdermal clonidine in reducing hyperarousal behaviors associated with autism. A double-blind, placebo-crossover study with transdermal clonidine was performed in nine autistic males (aged 5 to 33 years). Subjects received either clonidine (approximately 0.005 mg/kg/day) or placebo by a weekly transdermal patch. Each trial lasted 4 weeks with a 2-week washout period between treatment phases. Subjects were evaluated every 2 weeks by clinician raters and weekly by parents. The clonidine treatment showed a significant difference from placebo treatment on three subscales of the Ritvo-Freeman Real Life Rating Scale (i.e., social relationship to people, affectual responses, and sensory responses). The Clinical Global Impressions scale indicated that clonidine produced a significant improvement on severity of illness, global improvement, and efficacy index for therapeutic effect of the drug. A patient global rating scale showed clonidine treatment resulted in significant improvement in comparison with placebo. Adverse effects included sedation and fatigue during the first 2 weeks of clonidine treatment. Results from this preliminary study show that clonidine was effective in reducing several hyperarousal behaviors and improved social relationships in some autistic subjects. Further studies are needed in a larger autistic population to determine the dose-response relationship of clonidine.","Fankhauser M P, Karumanchi V C, German M L, Yates A, Karumanchi S D",The Journal of clinical psychiatry,"Administration, Cutaneous, Adolescent, Adult, Arousal, Attitude to Health, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Clonidine, Double-Blind Method, Fatigue, Humans, Male, Parents, Placebos, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Severity of Illness Index, Sleep Stages",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1548248,"Department of Pharmacy Practice, College of Pharmacy, University of Arizona, Tucson."

We conducted a placebo-controlled trial of DCS to potentiate social skills training in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) but found substantial improvement in both the DCS and placebo groups at the conclusion of active treatment. Here, we assess the impact of DCS 11 weeks following active treatment to evaluate the impact of DCS on treatment response durability. Study participants included 60 outpatient youth with ASD, ages 5-11 years, all with IQ above 70, and significantly impaired social functioning who completed a 10-week active treatment phase during which they received weekly single doses of 50 mg of DCS or placebo administered 30 min prior to group social skills training. Following the 10-week active treatment phase, blinded follow-up assessments occurred at week 11 and week 22. The primary outcome measure for our durability of treatment evaluation was the parent-rated social responsiveness scale (SRS) total raw score at week 22. Analysis of the SRS total raw score demonstrated significant decrease for the DCS group compared to the placebo group (<i>p</i> = 0.042) indicating greater maintenance of treatment effect in the DCS group. DCS was well tolerated, with irritability being the most frequently reported adverse effect in both groups. The findings of this study suggest that DCS may help youth with ASD to maintain skills gained during sort-term social skills training. Larger-scale studies with longer follow-up will be necessary to further understand the long-term impact of DCS paired with structured social skills training.

A drug was classified as being effective when over 70% of the patients taking the drug were judged as ""success"" in all 3 behavioral criteria: (1) sleeping; (2) body movement; and (3) crying behaviors. The study was observed by an independent clinician with an intraexaminer reliability of 88%. For sleeping behavior, midazolam was found to be significantly more effective than diazepam as the duration of stimulation increased (P<.05). For the movement and crying behaviors, midazolam also proved to be significantly more effective from the start of treatment through the 35- and 40-min markers, respectively (P<.05). For the remainder of treatment, however, there was no statistically significant difference in these behaviors between the trials (P>.05). Diazepam and midazolam were rated as 77% and 100% successful, according to the overall behavior evaluation criteria (P=.02). Both diazepam and midazolam were shown to be effective sedative agents, successfully and safely used to sedate autistic patients for dental treatment.

There were no significant differences between active and placebo groups on cognitive (contingency naming task) or behavioral (total score or subscales of the aberrant behavior checklist) outcomes. At baseline, the active and placebo groups did not differ in functional magnetic resonance imaging activation patterns during the gaze task. After 12 weeks of treatment the active group displayed reduced activation in response to the averted vs direct gaze contrast, relative to the placebo group, in the left superior frontal gyrus. Reduced functional brain activation for the active group may represent less arousal in response to direct eye gaze, relative to the placebo group. Change in functional magnetic resonance imaging activation patterns may serve as a more sensitive metric and predictor of response to treatment when compared to cognitive and behavioral assessments.

Clinical Global Impression Improvement/Severity scores significantly improved with zolpidem ( P = .03 and P = .006, respectively). A single, small randomized controlled trial of diphenhydramine reported small improvements in sleep outcomes (8-10 minutes' better sleep latency and duration) after 1 week. In 19 randomized controlled trials, melatonin significantly improved sleep latency (median 28 minutes; range 11-51 minutes), sleep duration (median 33 minutes; range 14-68 minutes), and wake time after sleep onset (range 12-43 minutes), but not number of awakenings per night (range 0-2.7). Function and behavior improvement varied. Improvement in sleep was greatest in children with autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders, and smaller in adolescents and children with chronic delayed sleep onset. Adverse events were infrequent with melatonin, but more frequent than placebo in children taking eszopiclone or zolpidem.

P3 maxima elicited by rare non-targets were recorded more rostrally after fenfluramine treatment. After rare non-targets N1 amplitudes at Fz decreased but P3 amplitudes at Pz increased. Early negativity after the rare non-target (particularly on the right side) was negatively correlated with the HVA/DA ratio. Subtraction of the P3 component elicited in a passive condition where no response was required from the active condition showed that P3 positivity to targets was halved with treatment.

Serotonin agonists modulate WM and there is evidence of positive behavioural effects in both disorders. We therefore used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate shared and disorder-specific brain dysfunctions of WM in these disorders, and the effects of a single dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine. Age-matched boys with ADHD (n = 17), ASD (n = 17) and controls (n = 22) were compared using fMRI during an N-back WM task. Patients were scanned twice, under either an acute dose of fluoxetine or placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized design. Repeated-measures analyses within patients assessed drug effects on performance and brain function. To test for normalization effects of brain dysfunctions, patients under each drug condition were compared to controls. Under placebo, relative to controls, both ADHD and ASD boys shared underactivation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Fluoxetine significantly normalized the DLPFC underactivation in ASD relative to controls whereas it increased posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) deactivation in ADHD relative to control boys. Within-patient analyses showed inverse effects of fluoxetine on PCC deactivation, which it enhanced in ADHD and decreased in ASD. The findings show that fluoxetine modulates brain activation during WM in a disorder-specific manner by normalizing task-positive DLPFC dysfunction in ASD boys and enhancing task-negative default mode network (DMN) deactivation in ADHD.","Chantiluke K, Barrett N, Giampietro V, Brammer M, Simmons A, Rubia K",Psychological medicine,"Adolescent, Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Double-Blind Method, Fluoxetine, Gyrus Cinguli, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Memory, Short-Term, Prefrontal Cortex, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25292351,"Department of Neuroimaging,Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London,UK.; South London and Maudsley NHS Trust,London,UK.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London,UK."

To date, clinical trials examining the use of SSRIs in autism have been limited by small sample sizes and inconclusive results. The efficacy and safety of SSRIs for moderating autistic behaviors is yet to be adequately examined to provide evidence to support current clinical practice. The aim of the Fluoxetine for Autistic Behaviors (FAB) study is to determine the efficacy and safety of low dose fluoxetine compared with placebo, for reducing the frequency and severity of repetitive stereotypic behaviors in children and adolescents with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The relationship between the effectiveness of fluoxetine treatment and serotonin transporter genotype will also be explored. The FAB study is a multicenter, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial, funded by the Australian Government's National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) grant. Participants will be aged between 7.5 and 17 years with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD. Eligible participants will be randomized to either placebo or fluoxetine for a 16-week period. Medication will be titrated over the first four weeks. Reponses to medication will be monitored fortnightly using the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI). The primary outcome measure is the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale-Modified for Pervasive Developmental Disorders (CYBOCS-PDD), administered at baseline and 16 weeks. Secondary outcome measures include the Aberrant Behaviour Scale (ABC), the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale Parent Report (SCAS-P), and the Repetitive Behaviors Scale (RBS-R), measured at baseline and 16 weeks. Participants will be invited to undergo genetic testing for SLC6A4 allele variants using a cheek swab. Continuous outcomes, including the primary outcome will be compared between the active and placebo groups using unadjusted linear regression. Binary outcomes will be compared using unadjusted logistic regression. The FAB study is a large clinical trial to specifically investigate the efficacy of low dose fluoxetine for restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped behaviors in ASD.

The core symptoms of autism are abnormalities in social interaction, communication and behaviour. The involvement of neurotransmitters such as 5-HT has been suggested in neuropsychiatric disorders and particularly in autistic disorder. Increased platelet 5-HT levels were found in 40% of the autistic population, suggesting that hyperserotonaemia may be a pathologic factor in infantile autism. Therefore, it is of interest to assess the efficacy of cyproheptadine, a 5-HT2 antagonist in the treatment of autistic disorder. In this 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we assessed the effects of cyproheptadine plus haloperidol in the treatment of autistic disorder. Children between the ages 3 and 11 years (inclusive) with a DSM IV clinical diagnosis of autism and who were outpatients from a specialty clinic for children at Roozbeh Psychiatric Teaching Hospital were recruited. The children presented with a chief complaint of severely disruptive symptoms related to autistic disorder. Patients were randomly allocated to cyproheptadine + haloperidol (Group A) or haloperidol + placebo (Group B) for an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The dose of haloperidol and cyproheptadine was titrated up to 0.05 and 0.2 mg/kg/day respectively. Patients were assessed by a third-year resident of psychiatry at baseline and after 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks of starting medication. The primary measure of the outcome was the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist-Community (ABC-C) and the secondary measure of the outcome was the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (relating to people and verbal communication). Side effects and extrapyramidal symptoms were systematically recorded throughout the study and were assessed using a checklist and the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale, administered by a resident of psychiatry during weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8. The ABC-C and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale scores improved with cyproheptadine. The behaviour of the two treatments was not homogeneous across time (groups-by-time interaction, Greenhouse-Geisser correction; F = 7.30, d.f. = 1.68, P = 0.002; F = 8.21, d.f. = 1.19, P = 0.004 respectively).

No significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of extrapyramidal symptoms (P = 0.23). The difference between the two groups in the frequency of side effects was not significant. The results suggest that the combination of cyproheptadine with a conventional antipsychotic may be superior to conventional antipsychotic alone for children with autistic disorder.

However, none of the studies have directly compared the effectiveness between the two interventions on treating sleep disturbance in children with ASD. Without direct comparison, we do not know which intervention is better. Thus, we designed a study to compare which intervention is more effective to treat sleep disturbance in children with ASD and to examine whether the combination of the two could be the most efficacious. We present a protocol for conducting a randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of physical exercise and melatonin supplement on treating sleep disturbance in children with ASD. The proposed study will be a four-group randomised control trial (RCT) design, with equal allocation of participants to the three intervention groups and one control group. All eligible participants will be randomly allocated to a morning jogging group, a melatonin supplement group, a combination group and a control group. Changes in sleep quality will be monitored through actigraphic assessment and parental sleep logs. Melatonin levels represented by 6-sulfoxymelatonin will be measured from the participants' 24-h and the first morning void urinary samples. All the assessments will be carried out before the intervention (T1), in the mid of the study (5 weeks after the commencement of the study) (T2) and after the 10-week intervention (T3).

A 4-week, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design was conducted following a 1-week baseline period. Either melatonin, 3 mg, or placebo was given to participants for 2 weeks and then alternated for another 2 weeks. Sleep variables, including sleep duration, sleep-onset time, sleep-onset latency time, and the number of night awakenings, were recorded using an Actiwatch and from sleep diaries completed by parents. All participants had been thoroughly assessed for ASD and also had DNA testing for the diagnosis of FXS. Data were successfully obtained from the 12 of 18 subjects who completed the study (11 males, age range 2 to 15.25 years, mean 5.47, SD 3.6). Five participants met diagnostic criteria for ASD, 3 for FXS alone, 3 for FXS and ASD, and 1 for fragile X premutation. Eight out of 12 had melatonin first.

This multisite, 4-week, randomized crossover trial compared three dose levels (low, medium, and high) of MPH with placebo. At baseline, the independent evaluator (IE) asked parents to nominate the child's two biggest problems. For each problem, the IE and parent coconstructed a brief narrative of the behavior and the impact on family life. The IE and parents reviewed and revised the narratives at subsequent visits. A panel of four judges, blind to treatment condition, independently reviewed the narratives to rate change from baseline on a 9-point scale: 1, normal; 2, markedly improved; 3, definitely improved; 4, equivocally improved; 5, no change; 6, possibly worse; 7, definitely worse; 8, markedly worse; 9, disastrously worse.

We present secondary analyses to better define the scope of effects of methylphenidate on symptoms that define attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), as well as the core autistic symptom domain of repetitive behavior. Sixty-six children (mean age 7.5 y) with autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, and PDD not otherwise specified, were randomized to varying sequences of placebo and three different doses of methylphenidate during a 4-week blinded, crossover study. Methylphenidate doses used approximated .125, .25, and .5 mg/kg per dose, twice daily, with an additional half-dose in the late afternoon. Outcome measures included the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Questionnaire revised for DSM-IV (ADHD and ODD scales) and the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scales for PDD. Methylphenidate was associated with significant improvement that was most evident at the .25- and .5-mg/kg doses. Hyperactivity and impulsivity improved more than inattention.

The goal of this study was to evaluate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of oral N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant whose function overlaps with proposed mechanisms of ASD pathophysiology, targeting core social impairment in youth with ASD. This study was a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral NAC in youth with ASD. Study participants were medically healthy youth age 4 to 12 years with ASD, weighing ≥15 kg, and judged to be moderately ill based on the Clinical Global Impressions Severity scale. The participants were randomized via computer to active drug or placebo in a 1:1 ratio, with the target dose of NAC being 60 mg/kg/day in three divided doses. The primary outcome measure of efficacy was the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement (CGI-I) scale anchored to core social impairment. To investigate the impact of NAC on oxidative stress markers in peripheral blood, venous blood samples were collected at screen and week 12. Thirty-one patients were enrolled (NAC = 16, placebo = 15). Three participants were lost to follow-up, and three left the trial due to adverse effects. The average daily dose of NAC at week 12 was 56.2 mg/kg (SD = 9.7) with dose ranging from 33.6 to 64.3 mg/kg. The frequency of adverse events was so low that comparisons between groups could not be conducted. At week 12, there was no statistically significant difference between the NAC and placebo groups on the CGI-I (p > 0.69) but the glutathione (GSH) level in blood was significantly higher in the NAC group (p < 0.05). The oxidative glutathione disulfide (GSSG) level increased in the NAC group, however only at a trend level of significance (p = 0.09). There was no significant difference between the NAC and placebo groups in the GSH/GSSG ratio, DNA strand break and oxidative damage, and blood homocysteine levels at week 12 (ps > 0.16). The results of this trial indicate that NAC treatment was well tolerated, had the expected effect of boosting GSH production, but had no significant impact on social impairment in youth with ASD.

Therapeutic trials with naltrexone].,1993-01-01,"The opioid hypothesis suggests that childhood autism may result from excessive brain opioid activity during neonatal period which may constitutionally inhibit social motivation, yielding autistic isolation and aloofness (Panksepp, 1979). This hypothesis has now received strong support and is currently based on three types of arguments: (1) similarity between autistic symptomatology and abnormal behaviors induced in young animals by injections of exogenous opioids, such as increasing social aloofness and decreasing social vocalization; (2) direct biochemical evidence of abnormalities of peripheral endogenous opioids being reported in autism and (3) therapeutic effects of the long lasting opioid receptor blocking agent naltrexone in autism. In this article, we give description of open and double-blind studies of naltrexone in autism. Naltrexone has been tested in several open studies. We performed an open trial with naltrexone in 2 autistic girls, displaying serious self-injurious behavior, reduced crying and a marked preference for salty and spicy foods, symptoms that could be related to a dysfunction of the opioid system. With dosages of 1 mg/kg/day, we observed an immediate reduction of hyperactivity, self-injurious behavior and aggressiveness, while attention improved. In addition, social behaviors, smiling, social seeking behaviors and play interactions increased (Leboyer, Bouvard et Dugas, 1988). Campbell et al. (1988) has also reported a tranquilizing and a stimulating effect in 6 out of 8 children with autism. We did confirm these preliminary results in a double-blind study performed on 4 children with autism. In a cross-over double-blind study, three dosages of naltrexone (0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg/day) and placebo were compared.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Leboyer M, Bouvard M P, Launay J M, Recasens C, Plumet M H, Waller-Perotte D, Tabuteau F, Bondoux D, Dugas M",L'Encephale,"Adolescent, Animals, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Double-Blind Method, Endorphins, Female, Humans, Male, Naltrexone, Receptors, Opioid",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8275903,"Service de Psychiatrie Adulte, Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Paris."

In particular, some studies have shown that children with ADHD may have lower concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly omega-3, in their red blood cells and plasma, and that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids may alleviate behavioural symptoms in this population. However, in order to compare levels it seems appropriate to establish fatty acid levels in a mainstream school aged population and if levels relate to learning and behaviour. To date no study has established this. For this study, cheek cell samples from 411 typically developing school children were collected and analysed for PUFA content, in order to establish the range in this population. In addition, measures of general classroom attention and behaviour were assessed in these children by teachers and parents. Cognitive performance tests were also administered in order to explore whether an association between behaviour and/or cognitive performance and PUFA levels exists. Relationships between PUFA levels and socio-economic status were also explored. Measures of reading, spelling and intelligence did not show any association with PUFA levels, but some associations were noted with the level of omega-3 fatty acids and teacher and parental reports of behaviour, with some evidence that higher omega-3 levels were associated with decreased levels of inattention, hyperactivity, emotional and conduct difficulties and increased levels of prosocial behaviour.

However, in prior trials, autistic individuals with co-occurring intellectual disability (ID) have largely been overlooked, despite their high prevalence, poorer outcome, and the enhanced need but reduced availability of therapeutic interventions. Prior studies have also overlooked the importance of standardizing the context in which oxytocin is administered, rendering outcomes from prior trials inconclusive. To meet these limitations, we propose a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial investigating the effects of intermittent multiple-dose intranasal oxytocin administration (4 weeks, 24 IU 3x/week), administered within a standardized psychosocial stimulating context at special need schools, in 80 children with autism and co-occurring ID (4-13 years old). Clinical-behavioral as well as stress-regulatory effects of oxytocin will be evaluated using the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC), the Brief Observation of Social Communication Change (BOSCC) expert rating scale, and measurements of high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), a validated index of parasympathetic autonomic nervous system activity. To assess the possibility of retention and/or late-emerging effects, outcomes will be assessed immediately after the administration regime, and at two follow-up sessions, four-weeks and six months after administration. Significant clinical-behavioral improvements on the ATEC and BOSCC, and significantly higher parasympathetic HF-HRV power in the oxytocin compared to the placebo group would confirm beneficial clinical-behavioral and stress-regulatory effects of oxytocin in autistic children with co-occurring ID. This would also corroborate the use of intermittent dosing schemes in combination with concomitant psychosocial stimulation.

Intranasal administration of oxytocin has been considered a potential therapeutic option for improving social difficulties in autism, either by enhancing the salience of social cues or by reducing the social stress and anxiety experienced in social encounters. We recorded fMRI brain activity while presenting neutral, fearful and scrambled faces, to compare the neural face processing signature of autistic children (n = 58) with that of matched non-autistic controls (n = 38). Next, in the autistic children group, we implemented this fMRI face processing task in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose oxytocin clinical trial, to evaluate the impact of four-week repeated oxytocin administration (24 IU daily dose) on brain activity in face processing regions. No significant diagnostic-group differences were identified between autistic versus non-autistic children with regard to neural face processing. Furthermore, no significant treatment effects were found in the oxytocin clinical trial. However, exploratory analyses (uncorrected for multiple comparisons) demonstrated decreases in brain activity in the left superior temporal sulcus (STS) and inferior frontal region in the oxytocin compared to the placebo group, and change-from-baseline analyses in the oxytocin group revealed significantly reduced neural activity in the core face-processing network (STS, inferior occipital, and posterior fusiform), as well as in amygdala and inferior frontal region.

We used a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over design on 30 typically developing young adult men to investigate the dynamics of EEG microstates corresponding to activity in defined neural networks.

Correlation analysis further revealed that the higher the social functioning, the more IN-OXT increased the appearance of the visual network-associated microstate, and suppressed the appearance of a default mode network-related microstate. The lower the social functioning, the more IN-OXT increases the appearance of the salience microstate. The effects we report on the salience microstate support the hypothesis that OXT regulates behavior by enhancing social salience. Moreover, our findings indicate that social functioning traits modulate responses to IN-OXT and could partially explain the inconsistent reports on IN-OXT effects.","Tomescu Miralena I, Van der Donck Stephanie, Perisanu Emanuela M, Berceanu Alexandru I, Alaerts Kaat, Boets Bart, Carcea Ioana",Psychophysiology,"Humans, Oxytocin, Administration, Intranasal, Male, Double-Blind Method, Young Adult, Cross-Over Studies, Adult, Electroencephalography, Social Behavior, Nerve Net",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38594888,"Faculty of Educational Sciences, Department of Psychology, University ""Stefan cel Mare"" of Suceava, Bucharest, Romania.; Center for Developmental Psychiatry, Department of Neurosciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.; CINETic Center, National University of Theatre and Film ""I.L.

38400592,10.1111/Jcpp.13966,Chronic oxytocin improves neural decoupling at rest in children with autism: an exploratory RCT.,2024-10-01,"Shifts in peak frequencies of oscillatory neural rhythms are put forward as a principal mechanism by which cross-frequency coupling/decoupling is implemented in the brain. During active neural processing, functional integration is facilitated through transitory formations of ""harmonic"" cross-frequency couplings, whereas ""nonharmonic"" decoupling among neural oscillatory rhythms is postulated to characterize the resting, default state of the brain, minimizing the occurrence of spurious, noisy, background couplings. Within this exploratory, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we assessed whether the transient occurrence of nonharmonic and harmonic relationships between peak-frequencies in the alpha (8-14 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) bands is impacted by intranasal administration of oxytocin, a neuromodulator implicated in improving homeostasis and reducing stress/anxiety. To do so, resting-state electroencephalography was acquired before and after 4 weeks of oxytocin administration (12 IU twice-daily) in children with autism spectrum disorder (8-12 years, n = 33 oxytocin; n = 34 placebo). At the baseline, neural assessments of children with autism were compared with those of a matched cohort of children without autism (n = 40). Compared to nonautistic peers, autistic children displayed a lower incidence of nonharmonic alpha-theta cross-frequency decoupling, indicating a higher incidence of spurious ""noisy"" coupling in their resting brain (p = .001). Dimensionally, increased neural coupling was associated with more social difficulties (p = .002) and lower activity of the parasympathetic ""rest & digest"" branch of the autonomic nervous system (p = .018), indexed with high-frequency heart-rate-variability. Notably, after oxytocin administration, the transient formation of nonharmonic cross-frequency configurations was increased in the cohort of autistic children (p < .001), indicating a beneficial effect of oxytocin on reducing spurious cross-frequency-interactions. Furthermore, parallel epigenetics changes of the oxytocin receptor gene indicated that the neural effects were likely mediated by changes in endogenous oxytocinergic signaling (p = .006). Chronic oxytocin induced important homeostatic changes in the resting-state intrinsic neural frequency architecture, reflective of reduced noisy oscillatory couplings and improved signal-to-noise properties.","Alaerts Kaat, Moerkerke Matthijs, Daniels Nicky, Zhang Qianqian, Grazia Ricchiuti, Steyaert Jean, Prinsen Jellina, Boets Bart","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","Humans, Oxytocin, Child, Male, Female, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Administration, Intranasal, Theta Rhythm, Alpha Rhythm, Electroencephalography",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38400592,"Research Group for Neurorehabilitation, Neuromodulation Laboratory, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.; Leuven Autism Research (LAuRes), KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium."

Previous investigations have emphasized the amygdala as the neural foundation for oxytocin's acute effects. However, to fully understand oxytocin's therapeutic potential, it is crucial to gain insight into the neuroplastic changes in amygdala circuitry induced from chronic oxytocin administrations, particularly in pediatric populations. We aimed to examine the impact of a 4-week course of intranasal oxytocin on amygdala functional connectivity in children with autism, compared to placebo. Additionally, we investigated whether oxytocin improves cardiac autonomic arousal, as indexed by high-frequency heart rate variability. Fifty-seven children with autism aged 8-12 years (45 boys, 12 girls) participated in a double-blind, randomized pharmaco-neuroimaging trial involving twice-daily administrations of intranasal oxytocin or placebo. Resting-state fMRI scans and simultaneous, in-scanner heart rate recordings were obtained before, immediately after, and 4 weeks after the nasal spray administration period. Significant reductions in intrinsic amygdala-orbitofrontal connectivity were observed, particularly at the 4-week follow-up session. These reductions were correlated with improved social symptoms and lower cardiac autonomic arousal. Further, oxytocin's neural and cardiac autonomic effects were modulated by epigenetic modifications of the oxytocin receptor gene. The effects were more pronounced in children with reduced epigenetic methylation, signifying heightened expression of the oxytocin receptor. These findings underscore that a 4-week oxytocin administration course decreases amygdala connectivity and improves cardiac autonomic balance. Epigenetic modulators may explain inter-individual variation in responses to oxytocin.","Alaerts Kaat, Daniels Nicky, Moerkerke Matthijs, Evenepoel Margaux, Tang Tiffany, Van der Donck Stephanie, Chubar Viktoria, Claes Stephan, Steyaert Jean, Boets Bart, Prinsen Jellina",Psychotherapy and psychosomatics,"Male, Female, Child, Humans, Oxytocin, Autistic Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Receptors, Oxytocin, Amygdala, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Double-Blind Method",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37820592,"KU Leuven, University Psychiatric Center, Leuven, Belgium.; KU Leuven, Leuven Autism Research (LAuRes) Consortium, Leuven, Belgium.; KU Leuven, Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Research Group for Neurorehabilitation, Leuven, Belgium."
37278339,10.1111/Jcpp.13850,Can repeated intranasal oxytocin administration affect reduced neural sensitivity towards expressive faces in autism? A randomized controlled trial.,2023-11-01,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by difficulties in social communication and interaction. Crucial for efficient social interaction is the ability to quickly and accurately extract information from a person's face. Frequency-tagging electroencephalography (EEG) is a novel tool to quantify face-processing sensitivity in a robust and implicit manner. In terms of intervention approaches, intranasal administration of oxytocin (OT) is increasingly considered as a potential pharmacological approach for improving socio-communicative difficulties in ASD, through enhancing social salience and/or reducing (social) stress and anxiety. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, mechanistic pharmaco-neuroimaging clinical trial, we implemented frequency-tagging EEG to conduct an exploratory investigation into the impact of repeated OT administration (4 weeks, 12 IU, twice daily) on neural sensitivity towards happy and fearful facial expressions in children with ASD (8-12 years old; OT: n = 29; placebo: n = 32). Neural effects were assessed at baseline, post-nasal spray (24 hr after the last nasal spray) and at a follow-up session, 4 weeks after the OT administration period. At baseline, neural assessments of children with ASD were compared with those of an age- and gender-matched cohort of neurotypical (NT) children (n = 39). Children with ASD demonstrated reduced neural sensitivity towards expressive faces, as compared to NT children. Upon nasal spray administration, children with ASD displayed a significant increase in neural sensitivity at the post- and follow-up sessions, but only in the placebo group, likely reflecting an implicit learning effect. Strikingly, in the OT group, neural sensitivity remained unaffected from the baseline to the post-session, likely reflecting a dampening of an otherwise typically occurring implicit learning effect. First, we validated the robustness of the frequency-tagging EEG approach to assess reduced neural sensitivity towards expressive faces in children with ASD. Furthermore, in contrast to social salience effects observed after single-dose administrations, repeated OT administration dampened typically occurring learning effects in neural sensitivity. In line with OT's social anxiolytic account, these observations possibly reflect a predominant (social) stress regulatory effect towards emotionally evocative faces after repeated OT administration.","Moerkerke Matthijs, Daniels Nicky, Van der Donck Stephanie, Tibermont Laura, Tang Tiffany, Debbaut Edward, Bamps Annelies, Prinsen Jellina, Steyaert Jean, Alaerts Kaat, Boets Bart","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","Child, Humans, Autistic Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Oxytocin, Administration, Intranasal, Nasal Sprays, Double-Blind Method",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37278339,"Center for Developmental Psychiatry, Department of Neurosciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.; Leuven Autism Research (LAuRes), KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium."

We have previously shown that intranasal administration of oxytocin facilitates the pleasantness of social touch and activation of brain reward and social processing regions, although it is unclear if it influences responses to gentle stroking touch mediated by cutaneous C-touch fibers or pressure touch mediated by other types of fibers. Additionally, it is unclear whether endogenous oxytocin acts via direct entry into the brain or by increased peripheral blood concentrations. In a randomized controlled design, we compared effects of intranasal (direct entry into the brain and increased peripheral concentrations) and oral (only peripheral increases) oxytocin on behavioral and neural responses to social touch targeting C-touch (gentle-stroking) or other (medium pressure without stroking) cutaneous receptors. Although both types of touch were perceived as pleasant, intranasal and oral oxytocin equivalently enhanced pleasantness ratings and responses of reward, orbitofrontal cortex, and social processing, superior temporal sulcus, regions only to gentle-stroking not medium pressure touch. Furthermore, increased blood oxytocin concentrations predicted the pleasantness of gentle stroking touch. The specificity of neural effects of oxytocin on C-touch targeted gentle stroking touch were confirmed by time-course extraction and classification analysis. Increased peripheral concentrations of oxytocin primarily modulate its behavioral and neural responses to gentle social touch mediated by C-touch fibers. Findings have potential implications for using oxytocin therapeutically in conditions where social touch is unpleasant. Key Technological Projects of Guangdong Province grant 2018B030335001.

The efficacy of multiple-dose oxytocin administration in children with ASD is, however, not well established. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with parallel design explored the effects of a 4-week intranasal oxytocin administration (12 IU, twice daily) on parent-rated social responsiveness (Social Responsiveness Scale: SRS-2) in pre-pubertal school-aged children (aged 8-12 years, 61 boys, 16 girls). Secondary outcomes included a questionnaire-based assessment of repetitive behaviors, anxiety, and attachment. Effects of oxytocin were assessed immediately after the administration period and at a follow-up, 4 weeks after the last administration. The double-blind phase was followed by a 4-week single-blind phase during which all participants received intranasal oxytocin. In the double-blind phase, both the oxytocin and placebo group displayed significant pre-to-post-improvements in social responsiveness and secondary questionnaires, but improvements were not specific to the intranasal oxytocin. Notably, in the single-blind phase, participants who were first allocated to intranasal placebo and later changed to intranasal oxytocin displayed a significant improvement in social responsiveness, over and above the placebo-induced improvements noted in the first phase. Participants receiving oxytocin in the first phase also showed a significant further improvement upon receiving a second course of oxytocin, but only at the 4-week follow-up. Further, exploratory moderator analyses indicated that children who received psychosocial trainings (3 or more sessions per month) along with oxytocin administration displayed a more pronounced improvement in social responsiveness. Future studies using larger cohorts and more explicitly controlled concurrent psychosocial trainings are warranted to further explore the preliminary moderator effects, also including understudied populations within the autism spectrum, such as children with co-occurring intellectual disabilities. Four weeks of oxytocin administration did not induce treatment-specific improvements in social responsiveness in school-aged children with ASD.

However, a gap persists in the literature regarding the potential effects of OT and the neural temporal dynamics due to OT administration. We explored the effect of OT on autistic individuals using magnetoencephalography (MEG), focusing on M100, M170, and M250, social perception-related components that tend to show atypical patterns in autistic individuals. Twenty-five autistic adolescents participated in this randomized, double-blind MEG study. Autistic individuals arrived at the lab twice and received an acute dose of intranasal OT or placebo in each session. During the scans, participants were asked to identify pictures of social and non-social stimuli. Additionally, 23 typically developing (TD) adolescents performed the same task in the MEG as a benchmark that allowed us to better characterize neural regions of interest and behavioral results for this age group in this task. A source-model beamformer analysis revealed that OT enhanced neural activity for social stimuli in frontal regions during M170. Additionally, in each of the preselected time windows, OT increased activation in the left hemisphere, regardless of the content of the presented stimuli. We suggest that OT increased the processing of social stimuli through two separate mechanisms. First, OT increased neural activity in a nonspecific manner, allowing increased allocation of attention toward the stimuli. Second, OT enhanced M170 activity in frontal regions only in response to social stimuli.

While several studies show that oxytocin (OT) modulates neural activation in social-related neural regions, the mechanism that underlies OT effects in ASD is not fully known yet. Despite evidence from animal studies on connections between the oxytocinergic system and excitation/inhibition neural balance, the influence of OT on oscillatory responses among individuals with ASD has been rarely examined. To bridge these gaps in knowledge, we investigated the effects of OT on both social and non-social stimuli while focusing on its specific influence on the neural connectivity between three socially related neural regions-the left and right fusiform and the medial frontal cortex. Twenty-five adolescents with ASD participated in a wall-established social task during a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled MEG and OT administration study. Our main task was a social-related task that required the identification of social and non-social-related pictures. We hypothesized that OT would modulate the oscillatory connectivity between three pre-selected regions of interest to be more adaptive to social processing. Specifically, we focused on alpha and gamma bands which are known to play an important role in face processing and top-down/bottom-up balance. Compared to placebo, OT reduced the connectivity between the medial frontal cortex and the fusiform in the low gamma more for social stimuli than for non-social ones, a reduction that was correlated with individuals' performance in the task. Additionally, for both social and non-social stimuli, OT increased the connectivity in the alpha and beta bands. Sample size was determined based on sample sizes previously reported in MEG in clinical populations, especially OT administration studies in combination with neuroimaging in ASD. We were limited in our capability to recruit for such a study, and as such, the sample size was not based on a priori power analysis. Additionally, we limited our analyses to specific neural bands and regions. To validate the current results, future studies may be needed to explore other parameters using whole-brain approaches in larger samples. These results suggest that OT influenced social perception by modifying the communication between frontal and posterior regions, an attenuation that potentially impacts both social and non-social early perception. We also show that OT influences differ between top-down and bottom-up processes, depending on the social context. Overall, by showing that OT influences both social-related perception and overall attention during early processing stages, we add new information to the existing understanding of the impact of OT on neural processing in ASD. Furthermore, by highlighting the influence of OT on early perception, we provide new directions for treatments for difficulties in early attentional phases in this population.

Intranasal administration of OXT is widely used to examine the drug's functional effects in both adults and children and is assumed to enter the brain directly via this route. However, OXT can also influence brain function through increased blood concentrations, and we have recently shown that orally (lingual) administered OXT also modulates neural responses to emotional faces and may be better tolerated for therapeutic use. Here, we examine whether 24 IU OXT administered orally can facilitate social attention. In a randomized, placebo-controlled pharmacologic study, we used a validated emotional antisaccade eye-tracking paradigm to explore the effects of oral OXT on bottom-up and top-down attention processing in 80 healthy male participants. Our findings showed that in terms of top-down attention, oral OXT increased errors for both social (angry, fearful, happy, sad, and neutral emotion faces) and nonsocial stimuli (oval shapes) in the antisaccade condition but increased response latencies only in the social condition. It also significantly reduced post-task state anxiety, but this reduction was not correlated with task performance. A comparison with our previous intranasal OXT study using the same task revealed that both routes have a similar effect on increasing antisaccade errors and response latencies and on reducing state anxiety.

Oxytocin was generally well tolerated, and there were no serious adverse events. The small sample size, potential challenges with drug administration, and expectancy bias due to relying on parent reported outcome measures may all contribute to limitations in interpreting results.

In particular, while numerous studies have demonstrated effects of oxytocin in promoting social attention the role of AVP has not been examined. The present study employed a randomized, double-blind, placebo (PLC)-controlled between-subject design to explore the social- and emotion-specific effects of AVP on both bottom-up and top-down attention processing with a validated emotional anti-saccade eye-tracking paradigm in 80 healthy male subjects (PLC = 40, AVP = 40). Our findings showed that AVP increased the error rate for social (angry, fearful, happy, neutral and sad faces) but not non-social (oval shapes) stimuli during the anti-saccade condition and reduced error rates in the pro-saccade condition. Comparison of these findings with a previous study (sample size: PLC = 33, OXT = 33) using intranasal oxytocin revealed similar effects of the two peptides on anti-saccade errors, although with some difference in effects of specific face emotions, but a significantly greater effect of AVP on pro-saccades. Both peptides also produced a post-task anxiolytic effect by reducing state anxiety. Together these findings suggested that both AVP and OXT decrease goal-directed top-down attention control to social salient stimuli but that AVP more potently increased bottom-up social attentional processing.","Zhuang Qian, Zheng Xiaoxiao, Becker Benjamin, Lei Wei, Xu Xiaolei, Kendrick Keith M",Psychoneuroendocrinology,"Administration, Intranasal, Arginine Vasopressin, Attention, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Humans, Male, Oxytocin",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34537624,"The Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, MOE Key Laboratory for Neuroinformation, Center for Information in Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, No. 2006, Xiyuan Ave., West Hi-Tech Zone, Chengdu 611761, Sichuan, China.

Current perspectives on the neuroendocrine substrates of this behavioral regulation highlight a role of the peptide hormone oxytocin (OXT), but it remains unclear whether the facilitating effects of OXT vary as a function of facial familiarity. Here, a total of 73 healthy participants was enrolled in an eye-tracking experiment specifically designed to test whether intranasal OXT (24 IU) augments gaze duration toward the eye-region across four different face categories: the participants' own face, the face of their romantic partner, the face of a familiar person (close friend) or an unfamiliar person (a stranger). We found that OXT treatment induced a tendency to spend more time looking into the eyes of familiar persons (partner and close friend) as compared to placebo. This effect was not evident in the self and unfamiliar conditions. Independent of treatment, volunteers scoring high on autistic-like traits (AQ-high) spent less time looking at the eyes of all faces except their partner. Collectively, our results show that the OXT system is involved in facilitating an attentional bias towards the eye region of familiar faces, which convey safety and support, especially in anxious contexts. In contrast, autistic-like traits were associated with reduced attention to the eye region of a face regardless of familiarity and OXT-treatment.","Marsh Nina, Scheele Dirk, Postin Danilo, Onken Marc, Hurlemann Rene",Frontiers in endocrinology,"Administration, Intranasal, Attention, Attitude, Autistic Disorder, Eye-Tracking Technology, Face, Female, Humans, Male, Oxytocin, Personality, Recognition, Psychology, Saliva, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34079520,"Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Carl von Ossietzky University Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany."

This type of joint social attention is impaired in disorders such as autism. Previous research has demonstrated that the neuropeptide oxytocin can facilitate attention toward social cues, although to date no study in humans has investigated its influence on socially directed gaze or on associations of the latter with autistic and empathic traits. In a within-subject, randomized, placebo-controlled trial we used eye-tracking to investigate the effects of intranasal oxytocin (24 IU) on socially directed gaze toward one of two objects in 40 adult male subjects. Subjects viewed videos of an actor and actress directing their gaze toward one of two objects by either moving only their eyes, moving both their eyes and head, or moving their eyes and head and pointing with a finger. Results showed that OXT increased the proportion of time subjects viewed the object the actor or actress were looking/pointing at across all three conditions, although unexpectedly we found no associations with trait autism or empathy under either placebo or OXT treatments. These findings demonstrate that OXT can facilitate socially directed gaze following to promote mutual attention toward objects which may be potentially beneficial therapeutically in disorders with impaired social communication and interaction.","Le Jiao, Zhao Weihua, Kou Juan, Fu Meina, Zhang Yingying, Becker Benjamin, Kendrick Keith M",Psychophysiology,"Adult, Attention, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Empathy, Eye-Tracking Technology, Fixation, Ocular, Humans, Male, Oxytocin, Social Perception, Visual Perception, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34032304,"The Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, MOE Key Laboratory for Neuroinformation, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China."

However, no studies have systematically investigated the effects of oxytocin on dynamic or directional aspects of functional connectivity. The present study employed a novel computational framework to investigate these latter aspects in 15 oxytocin-sensitive regions using data from randomized placebo-controlled between-subject resting state functional MRI studies incorporating 200 healthy subjects. In order to characterize the temporal dynamics, the 'temporal state' was defined as a temporal segment of the whole functional MRI signal which exhibited a similar functional interaction pattern among brain regions of interest. Results showed that while no significant effects of oxytocin were found on brain temporal state related characteristics (including temporal state switching frequency, probability of transitions between neighboring states, and averaged dwell time on each state) oxytocin extensively (n = 54 links) modulated effective connectivity among the 15 regions. The effects of oxytocin were primarily characterized by increased effective connectivity both between and within emotion, reward, salience, attention and social cognition processing networks and their interactions with the default mode network. Top-down control over emotional processing regions such as the amygdala was particularly affected. Oxytocin also increased effective homotopic interhemispheric connectivity in almost all these regions. Additionally, the effects of oxytocin on effective connectivity were sex-dependent, being more extensive in males. Overall, these findings suggest that modulatory effects of oxytocin on both within- and between-network interactions may underlie its functional influence on social-emotional behaviors, although in a sex-dependent manner. These findings may be of particular relevance to potential therapeutic use of oxytocin in psychiatric disorders associated with social dysfunction, such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, where directionality of treatment effects on causal interactions between networks may be of key importance .","Jiang Xi, Ma Xiaole, Geng Yayuan, Zhao Zhiying, Zhou Feng, Zhao Weihua, Yao Shuxia, Yang Shimin, Zhao Zhongbo, Becker Benjamin, Kendrick Keith M",NeuroImage,"Adult, Brain, Brain Mapping, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Image Processing, Computer-Assisted, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Nerve Net, Neural Pathways, Oxytocin, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33359350,"The Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, MOE Key Lab for Neuroinformation, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.

Previously, interactions of exogenously administered OT with its endogenous production have been demonstrated following single-dose administrations. However, the impact of repeated, long-term OT use on endogenous salivary OT levels is unknown. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study with between-subject design, 34 adult men with ASD were either assigned to a four-week treatment of once-daily intranasal OT administrations (24 IU) or placebo. Salivary OT samples were obtained before and after the treatment period as well as at two follow-up sessions, four weeks and one year after cessation of the treatment. Receiving OT intranasally but not placebo reliably increased endogenous salivary levels of OT immediately post-treatment and at the follow-up session four weeks post treatment, indicating an interaction between exogenously administered OT and its endogenous production. Notably, increases in salivary OT at the four-week follow-up session were most pronounced in individuals with larger behavioral improvements in ASD social symptoms. These results suggest that OT's positive effects on social behaviors may lead to a self-perpetuating elevation of OT levels through a feed-forward triggering of its own release. Together, the current investigation provides initial evidence that repeated intranasal administration of OT can induce long-lasting changes in endogenous salivary OT levels, presumably through a positive spiral of OT release.","Alaerts Kaat, Steyaert Jean, Vanaudenaerde Bart, Wenderoth Nicole, Bernaerts Sylvie",European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology,"Administration, Intranasal, Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Double-Blind Method, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Oxytocin",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33309460,"University of Leuven, KU Leuven, Belgium, Department of Neurosciences, Group Biomedical Sciences, Psychiatry Research Group, Belgium; Leuven Autism Research Consortium, KU Leuven, Belgium.; University of Leuven, KU Leuven, Belgium, Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Group Biomedical Sciences, Neurorehabilitation Research Group, Belgium; Leuven Autism Research Consortium, KU Leuven, Belgium.; ETH Zurich, Switzerland, Department of Health Sciences and Technology, Neural Control of Movement Lab, Switzerland.; University of Leuven, KU Leuven, Belgium, Department of Chronic Diseases, Metabolism and Ageing, Group Biomedical Sciences, Pneumology Research Group, Belgium.; University of Leuven, KU Leuven, Belgium, Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Group Biomedical Sciences, Neurorehabilitation Research Group, Belgium; Leuven Autism Research Consortium, KU Leuven, Belgium.

We conducted a combined behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study to investigate voice-identity recognition following intranasal administration of oxytocin or placebo in a group of adults diagnosed with ASD (full-scale intelligence quotient > 85) and pairwise-matched typically developing (TD) controls. A single dose of 24 IU oxytocin was administered in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and cross-over design. In the control group, but not in the ASD group, administration of oxytocin compared to placebo increased responses to recognition of voice identity in contrast to speech in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus/gyrus (pSTS/G) - a region implicated in the perceptual analysis of voice-identity information. In the ASD group, the right pSTS/G responses were positively correlated with voice-identity recognition accuracy in the oxytocin condition, but not in the placebo condition. Oxytocin did not improve voice-identity recognition performance at the group level. The ASD compared to the control group had lower right pSTS/G responses to voice-identity recognition. Since ASD is known to have atypical pSTS/G, the results indicate that the potential of intranasal oxytocin to enhance mechanisms for voice-identity recognition might be variable and dependent on the functional integrity of this brain region.","Borowiak Kamila, von Kriegstein Katharina",Translational psychiatry,"Administration, Intranasal, Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Brain, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Humans, Identity Recognition, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Oxytocin",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32636360,"Technische Universität Dresden, Bamberger Straße 7, 01187, Dresden, Germany.; Technische Universität Dresden, Bamberger Straße 7, 01187, Dresden, Germany. kamila.borowiak@tu-dresden.de."

In this double-blind cross-over study, saliva samples were collected from 16 autistic and 29 neurotypical women before and after intranasal administration of 24 IU oxytocin or placebo. Oestradiol, testosterone, and oxytocin levels were quantified in saliva samples. Participants also completed the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) and Empathy Quotient (EQ) questionnaires. Distinct patterns of change in testosterone and oestradiol levels pre- to-post-administration were observed in autistic relative to neurotypical women (ANCOVA, p < 0.05 main effect of Group), controlling for sample collection time. The mean percent change oestradiol was + 8.8% for the autism group and - 13.0% for the neurotypical group (t = 1.81, p = 0.08), while the mean percent change testosterone was + 1.1% in the autism group and - 12.6% in the neurotypical group (t = 1.26, p = 0.22).

Robust regression confirmed that group differences in percent change hormone levels were not driven by a small number of influential individuals. Baseline hormone levels did not differ between groups when considered individually. However, baseline testosterone relative to oestradiol (T:E2 ratio) was higher in autistic women (p = 0.023, Cohen's d = 0.63), and this ratio correlated positively and negatively with AQ and EQ scores, respectively, in the combined sample. Further studies with larger and more diverse autistic sample are warranted to confirm these effects.

Despite some promising results from animal studies, little is known about the efficacy of supplementation with <i>L. reuteri</i>, alone or with exogenous OXT therapy, on social-behavioral functions in ASD patients. This paper presents a protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a full trial comparing oral supplementation of <i>L. reuteri</i> probiotics and intranasal OXT spray to placebo on the effect of social and behavioral functions in ASD patients. The study will also capture preliminary estimates of the efficacy of the proposed interventions in ASD patients. This pilot trial is a two-staged, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Throughout the study (0-24 weeks), 60 patients with ASD will be randomly assigned to receive either oral <i>L. reuteri</i> probiotics or placebo. In the second study stage (13-24 weeks), all participants will receive intranasal OXT spray. As primary outcomes, serum OXT levels will be assayed and social behaviors will be assessed via the Autism Behavior Checklist and the Social Responsiveness Scale which are validated questionnaires, an objective emotional facial matching test, and a new video-based eye-tracking test. Secondary outcomes include the GI-severity-index and Bristol Stool Chart to assess GI function and gut microbiome/short-chain fatty acids.

Most of the intellectually disabled participants were found to be feasible participants of the RCT. We observed significantly more events regarded as reciprocal social interaction in the OT group compared with the placebo group. In the trial, no or little differences in adverse events were found between the OT and placebo arms, as found in some other reports. However, seizures were induced in three participants with medical history of epilepsy during or after OT treatment. In conclusion, we stress that behavioral changes in ASD patients with intellectual disabilities could be recognized not by the conventional measurements of ASD symptoms but by detailed evaluation of social interactions arising in daily-life situations.","Higashida Haruhiro, Munesue Toshio, Kosaka Hirotaka, Yamasue Hidenori, Yokoyama Shigeru, Kikuchi Mitsuru","Diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813294,"Research Center for Child Mental Development, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa 920-8640, Japan. mitsuruk@med.kanazawa-u.ac.jp.; Department of Psychiatry and Research Center for Child Mental Development, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu 431-3192, Japan. yamasue-tky@umin.ac.jp.; Research Center for Child Mental Development, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa 920-8640, Japan. shigeruy@med.kanazawa-u.ac.jp.; Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medical Sciences and Research Center for Child Mental Development, University of Fukui, Eiheiji 910-1193, Japan. hirotaka@u-fukui.ac.jp.; Research Center for Child Mental Development, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa 920-8640, Japan. haruhiro@med.kanazawa-u.ac.jp.; Research Center for Child Mental Development, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa 920-8640, Japan. munesue@med.kanazawa-u.ac.jp."
30390065,10.1038/S41386-018-0258-7,Neural modulation of social reinforcement learning by intranasal oxytocin in male adults with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder: a randomized trial.,2019-03-01,"Reduced social motivation is a hallmark of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Although the exact neural mechanisms are unclear, oxytocin has been shown to enhance motivation and attention to social stimuli, suggesting a potential to augment social reinforcement learning as the central mechanism of behavioral interventions in ASD. We tested how reinforcement learning in social contexts and associated reward prediction error (RPE) signals in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) were modulated by intranasal oxytocin. Male adults with a childhood diagnosis of ASD (n = 15) and healthy controls (n = 24; aged 18-26 years) performed a probabilistic reinforcement learning task during functional magnetic resonance imaging in a single-center (research center in Germany), randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial. The interventions were intranasal oxytocin (Syntocinon<sup>®</sup>, Novartis; 10 puffs = 20 international units (IUs) per treatment) and placebo spray. Using computational modeling of behavioral data, trial-by-trial RPE signals were assessed and related to brain activation in NAcc during reinforcing feedback in social and non-social contexts. The order of oxytocin/placebo was randomized for 60 participants. Twenty-one participants were excluded from analyses, leaving 39 for the final analysis. Behaviorally, individuals with ASD showed enhanced learning under oxytocin when the learning target as well as feedback was social as compared to non-social (social vs. non-social target: 87.09% vs. 71.29%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 7.28-24.33, p = .003; social vs. non-social feedback: 81.00% vs. 71.29%, 95% CI: 2.81-16.61, p = .027). Correspondingly, oxytocin enhanced the correlation of the RPE signal with NAcc activation during social (vs. non-social) feedback in ASD (3.48 vs. -1.12, respectively, 95% CI: 2.98-6.22, p = .000), whereas in controls, this effect was found in the placebo condition (2.90 vs. -1.14, respectively, 95% CI: 1.07-7.01, p = .010). In ASD, a similar pattern emerged when the learning target was social (3.00 vs. -0.64, respectively, 95% CI: -0.13 to 7.41, p = .057), whereas controls showed a reduced correlation for social learning targets under oxytocin (-0.70 vs. 2.72, respectively, 95% CI: -5.86 to 0.98, p = .008). The current data suggest that intranasal oxytocin has the potential to enhance social reinforcement learning in ASD. Future studies are warranted that investigate whether oxytocin can potentiate social learning when combined with behavioral therapies, resulting in greater treatment benefits than traditional behavior-only approaches.","Kruppa Jana A, Gossen Anna, Oberwelland Weiß Eileen, Kohls Gregor, Großheinrich Nicola, Cholemkery Hannah, Freitag Christine M, Karges Wolfram, Wölfle Elke, Sinzig Judith, Fink Gereon R, Herpertz-Dahlmann Beate, Konrad Kerstin, Schulte-Rüther Martin",Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,"Administration, Intranasal, Adolescent, Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Double-Blind Method, Feedback, Psychological, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Nucleus Accumbens, Oxytocin, Reinforcement, Social, Social Learning, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30390065,"Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, LVR-Klinik Bonn, Bonn, Germany.; Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-3), Jülich Research Center, Jülich, Germany.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics, and Psychotherapy, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.; Division of Endocrinology and Diabetes, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics, and Psychotherapy, University Hospital Frankfurt, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics, and Psychotherapy, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany. mschulte@ukaachen.de."

Whereas evidence from animal models emphasizes the critical role of the ventral striatum in the behavioral effects of oxytocin, region-specific contributions of the basal ganglia have not been systematically explored in humans. The present study combined the randomized placebo-controlled administration of oxytocin versus placebo in healthy men (n = 144) with fMRI-based resting-state functional connectivity to determine the modulatory role of oxytocin on the major basal ganglia pathways. Oxytocin specifically increased connectivity between ventral striatal and pallidal nodes with upstream frontal regions, whereas it decreased the strengths of downstream pathways between the dorsal striatum and posterior cerebellum. These pathways have previously been implicated in salience, reward and behavioral flexibility, thus shaping goal-directed behavior. Given the importance of aberrant striatal intrinsic organization in autism, addiction and schizophrenia the present findings may suggest new mechanistic perspectives for the therapeutic potential of oxytocin in these disorders.","Zhao Zhiying, Ma Xiaole, Geng Yayuan, Zhao Weihua, Zhou Feng, Wang Jiaojian, Markett Sebastian, Biswal Bharat B, Ma Yina, Kendrick Keith M, Becker Benjamin",NeuroImage,"Adult, Brain Mapping, Cerebellum, Corpus Striatum, Frontal Lobe, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Neural Pathways, Oxytocin, Ventral Striatum, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30266264,"The Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, MOE Key Laboratory for Neuroinformation, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.; The Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, MOE Key Laboratory for Neuroinformation, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China; Department of Biomedical Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA.; The Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, MOE Key Laboratory for Neuroinformation, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.

28712371,10.1017/S0954579417001018,Visual systemizing preference in children with autism: A randomized controlled trial of intranasal oxytocin.,2018-05-01,"Several studies have suggested that the neuropeptide oxytocin may enhance aspects of social communication in autism. Little is known, however, about its effects on nonsocial manifestations, such as restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. In the empathizing-systemizing theory of autism, social deficits are described along the continuum of empathizing ability, whereas nonsocial aspects are characterized in terms of an increased preference for patterned or rule-based systems, called systemizing. We therefore developed an automated eye-tracking task to test whether children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared to matched controls display a visual preference for more highly organized and structured (systemized) real-life images. Then, as part of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, we examined the effect of intranasal oxytocin on systemizing preferences in 16 male children with ASD, compared with 16 matched controls. Participants viewed 14 slides, each containing four related pictures (e.g., of people, animals, scenes, or objects) that differed primarily on the degree of systemizing. Visual systemizing preference was defined in terms of the fixation time and count for each image. Unlike control subjects who showed no gaze preference, individuals with ASD preferred to fixate on more highly systemized pictures. Intranasal oxytocin eliminated this preference in ASD participants, who now showed a similar response to control subjects on placebo. In contrast, control participants increased their visual preference for more systemized images after receiving oxytocin versus placebo. These results suggest that, in addition to its effects on social communication, oxytocin may play a role in some of the nonsocial manifestations of autism.","Strathearn Lane, Kim Sohye, Bastian D Anthony, Jung Jennifer, Iyengar Udita, Martinez Sheila, Goin-Kochel Robin P, Fonagy Peter",Development and psychopathology,"Administration, Intranasal, Adolescent, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Choice Behavior, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Fixation, Ocular, Humans, Male, Oxytocin, Pattern Recognition, Visual",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28712371,Baylor College of Medicine.; University of Iowa.

We examined two doses of oxytocin delivered using a novel Breath Powered intranasal delivery device designed to improve direct nose-to-brain activity in a double-blind, crossover, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. In a randomized sequence of single-dose sessions, 17 male adults with ASD received 8 international units (IU) oxytocin, 24IU oxytocin or placebo followed by four social-cognitive tasks. We observed an omnibus main effect of treatment on the primary outcome measure of overt emotion salience as measured by emotional ratings of faces (η<sup>2</sup>=0.18). Compared to placebo, 8IU treatment increased overt emotion salience (P=0.02, d=0.63). There was no statistically significant increase after 24IU treatment (P=0.12, d=0.4).

The neuropeptide oxytocin triggers anxiolytic functions and enhances eye gaze, facial emotion recognition and neural correlates of face processing in ASD. Here we investigated whether a single dose of oxytocin increases attention to faces in ASD. As a secondary question, we explored the influence of social anxiety on these effects. We tested for oxytocin's effects on attention to neutral faces as compared to houses in a sample of 29 autistic individuals and 30 control participants using a dot-probe paradigm with two different presentation times (100 or 500 ms). A single dose of 24 IU oxytocin was administered in a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Under placebo, ASD individuals paid less attention to faces presented for 500 ms than did controls. Oxytocin administration increased the allocation of attention toward faces in ASD to a level observed in controls. Secondary analyses revealed that these oxytocin effects primarily occurred in ASD individuals with high levels of social anxiety who were characterized by attentional avoidance of faces under placebo. Our results confirm a positive influence of intranasal oxytocin on social attention processes in ASD. Further, they suggest that oxytocin may in particular restore the attentional preference for facial information in ASD individuals with high social anxiety. We conclude that oxytocin's anxiolytic properties may partially account for its positive effects on socio-cognitive functioning in ASD, such as enhanced eye gaze and facial emotion recognition.","Kanat M, Spenthof I, Riedel A, van Elst L T, Heinrichs M, Domes G",Translational psychiatry,"Adult, Attention, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Choice Behavior, Double-Blind Method, Facial Expression, Facial Recognition, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Oxytocin, Phobia, Social, Reaction Time",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28418399,"Department of Psychiatry, Section for Experimental Neuropsychiatry, University Medical School Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.; Department of Psychology, Laboratory for Biological and Personality Psychology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.; Freiburg Brain Imaging Center, University Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany."

Previous oxytocin studies are male biased and often constrained by task-based inferences. Here, we investigate the impact of oxytocin on resting-state connectivity between subcortical and cortical networks in women. We collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data on 26 typically developing women 40 min following intranasal oxytocin administration using a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design. Independent components analysis (ICA) was applied to examine connectivity between networks. An independent analysis of oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene expression in human subcortical and cortical areas was carried out to determine plausibility of direct oxytocin effects on OXTR. In women, OXTR was highly expressed in striatal and other subcortical regions, but showed modest expression in cortical areas. Oxytocin increased connectivity between corticostriatal circuitry typically involved in reward, emotion, social communication, language and pain processing. This effect was 1.39 standard deviations above the null effect of no difference between oxytocin and placebo. This oxytocin-related effect on corticostriatal connectivity covaried with autistic traits, such that oxytocin-related increase in connectivity was stronger in individuals with higher autistic traits. In sum, oxytocin strengthened corticostriatal connectivity in women, particularly with cortical networks that are involved in social-communicative, motivational and affective processes. This effect may be important for future work on neurological and psychiatric conditions (for example, autism), particularly through highlighting how oxytocin may operate differently for subsets of individuals.","Bethlehem R A I, Lombardo M V, Lai M-C, Auyeung B, Crockford S K, Deakin J, Soubramanian S, Sule A, Kundu P, Voon V, Baron-Cohen S",Translational psychiatry,"Administration, Intranasal, Adult, Affect, Cerebral Cortex, Communication, Connectome, Corpus Striatum, Double-Blind Method, Female, Gene Expression, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Middle Aged, Motivation, Nerve Net, Receptors, Oxytocin, Social Behavior, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28418398,"Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.; Department of Psychiatry, Autism Research Centre, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.; Brain Imaging Center, Icahn Institute of Medicine at Mt.

We conducted a single-center phase 2, pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, clinical trial in young adults with high-functioning ASD, to determine whether oxytocin dosage and genetic background of the oxytocin receptor affects oxytocin efficacy. This trial consisted of double-blind (12 weeks), open-label (12 weeks) and follow-up phases (8 weeks). To examine dose dependency, 60 participants were randomly assigned to high-dose (32 IU per day) or low-dose intranasal oxytocin (16 IU per day), or placebo groups during the double-blind phase. Next, we measured single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR). In the intention-to-treat population, no outcomes were improved after oxytocin administration. However, in male participants, Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scores in the high-dose group, but not the low-dose group, were significantly higher than in the placebo group. Furthermore, we examined whether oxytocin efficacy, reflected in the CGI-I scores, is influenced by estimated daily dosage and OXTR polymorphisms in male participants. We found that >21 IU per day oxytocin was more effective than ⩽21 IU per day, and that a SNP in OXTR (rs6791619) predicted CGI-I scores for ⩽21 IU per day oxytocin treatment. No severe adverse events occurred.

OXT indeed promoted the attribution of relationship qualities not only in the case of social and semi-social stimuli, but also brands. Intriguingly, for subjects scoring high on autistic-like traits, the effect of OXT was completely reversed, evident in even lower relationship qualities across all stimulus categories. The importance of OXT in a CBR context is further corroborated by a three-fold increase in endogenous release of OXT following exposure to one's favorite brand and positive associations between baseline peripheral OXT concentrations and brand relationship qualities.

Oxytocin has been widely reported to affect social-communicative function and its neural underpinnings. Here we report the first evidence that intranasal oxytocin administration improves a core problem that individuals with autism have in using eye contact appropriately in real-world social settings. A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design is used to examine how intranasal administration of 24 IU of oxytocin affects gaze behavior for 32 adult males with autism and 34 controls in a real-time interaction with a researcher. This interactive paradigm bypasses many of the limitations encountered with conventional static or computer-based stimuli. Eye movements are recorded using eye tracking, providing an objective measurement of looking patterns. The measure is shown to be sensitive to the reduced eye contact commonly reported in autism, with the autism group spending less time looking to the eye region of the face than controls. Oxytocin administration selectively enhanced gaze to the eyes in both the autism and control groups (transformed mean eye-fixation difference per second=0.082; 95% CI:0.025-0.14, P=0.006). Within the autism group, oxytocin has the most effect on fixation duration in individuals with impaired levels of eye contact at baseline (Cohen's d=0.86). These findings demonstrate that the potential benefits of oxytocin in autism extend to a real-time interaction, providing evidence of a therapeutic effect in a key aspect of social communication.","Auyeung B, Lombardo M V, Heinrichs M, Chakrabarti B, Sule A, Deakin J B, Bethlehem R A I, Dickens L, Mooney N, Sipple J A N, Thiemann P, Baron-Cohen S",Translational psychiatry,"Administration, Intranasal, Adolescent, Adult, Asperger Syndrome, Autistic Disorder, Case-Control Studies, Double-Blind Method, Eye Movement Measurements, Fixation, Ocular, Humans, Interpersonal Relations, Male, Middle Aged, Oxytocics, Oxytocin, Social Behavior, Social Skills, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25668435,"Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.; 1] Department of Psychology, Laboratory for Biological and Personality Psychology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany [2] Freiburg Brain Imaging Center, University Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.; 1] Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK [2] School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences, University of Reading, Whiteknights, Reading, UK.; 1] Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK [2] Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT), Cambridge, UK.; 1] Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK [2] Department of Psychology, University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus [3] Center for Applied Neuroscience, University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus.; 1] Department of Psychology, The School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK [2] Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.; 1] Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK [2] Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT), Cambridge, UK.; South Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, Bedford, UK."

However, most participants have been male, while previous research in our lab demonstrated sexually differentiated effects of OT and AVP on the neural response to reciprocated cooperation. Here we extend our previous work by significantly increasing the number of participants to enable the use of more stringent statistical thresholds that permit more precise localization of OT and AVP effects in the brain. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 153 men and 151 women were randomized to receive 24 IU intranasal OT, 20 IU intranasal AVP or placebo. Afterwards, they were imaged with fMRI while playing an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game with same-sex partners. Sex differences were observed for effects of OT on the neural response to reciprocated cooperation, such that OT increased the caduate/putamen response among males, whereas it decreased this response among females. Thus, 24 IU OT may increase the reward or salience of positive social interactions among men, while decreasing their reward or salience among women. Similar sex differences were also observed for AVP effects within bilateral insula and right supramarginal gyrus when a more liberal statistical threshold was employed.

Our recent paper reported that oxytocin mitigated autistic behavioral deficits through the restoration of activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), as demonstrated with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a socio-communication task. However, it is unknown whether oxytocin exhibited effects at the neuronal level, which was outside of the specific task examined. In the same randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject cross-over clinical trial in which a single dose of intranasal oxytocin (24 IU) was administered to 40 men with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (UMIN000002241/000004393), we measured N-acetylaspartate (NAA) levels, a marker for neuronal energy demand, in the vmPFC using (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS). The differences in the NAA levels between the oxytocin and placebo sessions were associated with oxytocin-induced fMRI signal changes in the vmPFC. The oxytocin-induced increases in the fMRI signal could be predicted by the NAA differences between the oxytocin and placebo sessions (P=0.002), an effect that remained after controlling for variability in the time between the fMRI and (1)H-MRS scans (P=0.006) and the order of administration of oxytocin and placebo (P=0.001). Furthermore, path analysis showed that the NAA differences in the vmPFC triggered increases in the task-dependent fMRI signals in the vmPFC, which consequently led to improvements in the socio-communication difficulties associated with autism. The present study suggests that the beneficial effects of oxytocin are not limited to the autistic behavior elicited by our psychological task, but may generalize to other autistic behavioral problems associated with the vmPFC.","Aoki Y, Watanabe T, Abe O, Kuwabara H, Yahata N, Takano Y, Iwashiro N, Natsubori T, Takao H, Kawakubo Y, Kasai K, Yamasue H",Molecular psychiatry,"Administration, Intranasal, Adult, Aspartic Acid, Autistic Disorder, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Image Processing, Computer-Assisted, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Male, Oxygen, Oxytocics, Oxytocin, Prefrontal Cortex, Protons, Recovery of Function, Retrospective Studies, Time Factors, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25070538,"Department of Radiology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Child Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; 1] Department of Radiology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan [2] Department of Radiology, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; 1] Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan [2] Department of Physiology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; 1] Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan [2] Japan Science and Technology Agency, CREST, Tokyo, Japan."

We asked whether these chemical messengers interact in the regulation of emotion-based behavior by administering OXT or placebo to 24 healthy subjects and mapping cerebral 5-HT system by using 2'-methoxyphenyl-(N-2'-pyridinyl)-p-[(18)F]fluoro-benzamidoethylpiperazine ([(18)F]MPPF), an antagonist of 5-HT1A receptors. OXT increased [(18)F]MPPF nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), the core area of 5-HT synthesis, and in the amygdala/hippocampal complex, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex. Importantly, the amygdala appears central in the regulation of 5-HT by OXT: [(18)F]MPPF BPND changes in the DRN correlated with changes in right amygdala, which were in turn correlated with changes in hippocampus, insula, subgenual, and orbitofrontal cortex, a circuit implicated in the control of stress, mood, and social behaviors. OXT administration is known to inhibit amygdala activity and results in a decrease of anxiety, whereas high amygdala activity and 5-HT dysregulation have been associated with increased anxiety. The present study reveals a previously unidentified form of interaction between these two systems in the human brain, i.e., the role of OXT in the inhibitory regulation of 5-HT signaling, which could lead to novel therapeutic strategies for mental disorders.","Mottolese Raphaelle, Redouté Jérôme, Costes Nicolas, Le Bars Didier, Sirigu Angela",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"Administration, Intranasal, Adult, Amygdala, Binding, Competitive, Brain, Double-Blind Method, Frontal Lobe, Gyrus Cinguli, Hippocampus, Humans, Male, Oxytocin, Piperazines, Positron-Emission Tomography, Pyridines, Raphe Nuclei, Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A, Serotonin, Serotonin 5-HT1 Receptor Antagonists, Signal Transduction, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24912179,"Centre d'Etude et de Recherche Multimodal et Pluridisciplinaire Imagerie du Vivant, 69003 Lyon, France.; University Claude Bernard Lyon 1, 69609 Lyon, France; andCentre d'Etude et de Recherche Multimodal et Pluridisciplinaire Imagerie du Vivant, 69003 Lyon, France.; Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, Unité Mixte de Recherche 5229, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, 69675 Bron, France;University Claude Bernard Lyon 1, 69609 Lyon, France; and sirigu@isc.cnrs.fr.; Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, Unité Mixte de Recherche 5229, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, 69675 Bron, France;University Claude Bernard Lyon 1, 69609 Lyon, France; and."

Less is known about the modulatory influence of OXT on the neural and emotional responses to human interpersonal touch. The present randomized placebo (PLC)-controlled within-subject pharmaco-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was designed to test the hypothesis that a single intranasal dose of synthetic OXT (24 IU) would facilitate both neural and emotional responses to interpersonal touch in a context- (female vs male touch) and trait- (autistic trait load) specific manner. Specifically, the experimental rationale was to manipulate the reward value of interpersonal touch independent of the intensity and type of actual cutaneous stimulation administered. Thus, 40 heterosexual males believed that they were touched by either a man or a woman, although in fact an identical pattern of touch was always given by the same female experimenter blind to condition type. Our results show that OXT increased the perceived pleasantness of female, but not male touch, and associated neural responses in insula, precuneus, orbitofrontal, and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex. Moreover, the behavioral and neural effects of OXT were negatively correlated with autistic-like traits. Taken together, this is the first study to show that the perceived hedonic value of human heterosexual interpersonal touch is facilitated by OXT in men, but that its behavioral and neural effects in this context are blunted in individuals with autistic traits.","Scheele Dirk, Kendrick Keith M, Khouri Christoph, Kretzer Elisa, Schläpfer Thomas E, Stoffel-Wagner Birgit, Güntürkün Onur, Maier Wolfgang, Hurlemann René",Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,"Administration, Intranasal, Adult, Autistic Disorder, Brain, Brain Mapping, Central Nervous System Agents, Double-Blind Method, Emotions, Heterosexuality, Humans, Interpersonal Relations, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Oxytocin, Reward, Touch Perception",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24694924,"1] Department of Psychiatry, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany [2] Division of Medical Psychology, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.; Department of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.; 1] Department of Psychiatry, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany [2] Departments of Psychiatry and Mental Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.; 1] Department of Psychiatry, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany [2] German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Bonn, Germany.; Key Laboratory for Neuroinformation, School of Life Science and Technology, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, PR China.; Department of Biopsychology, Ruhr University, Bochum, Germany."

In mammals, social participation originates within the parent-infant bond and is supported by the oxytocin (OT) system, whose functioning is transmitted from parent to child through patterns of parental care. Human studies indicate that OT administration increases affiliative behavior, including trust, empathy, and social reciprocity. Here, we examine whether OT administration to parent can enhance physiological and behavioral processes that support parental social engagement but, moreover, can have parallel effects on the infant. Utilizing a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, 35 fathers and their 5-month-old infants were observed twice following administration of OT or placebo to father in the face-to-face still-face paradigm. Parent and infant salivary OT were assessed at multiple time points, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was measured in the three face-to-face still-face episodes, and social behaviors of the parent and child were micro-coded for indices of social engagement. Oxytocin administration increased father salivary OT, RSA during free play, and key parenting behaviors that support parental-infant bonding. Parallel increases were also found in the infant's salivary OT, RSA response, and engagement behavior, including social gaze, exploration, and social reciprocity. Results are the first to demonstrate that OT administration to one attachment partner can have parallel effects on the other and underscore the role of OT in the cross-generation transmission of human social participation.

These effects are probably mediated by genetic variations within the OT system. One potential candidate could be the CD38 gene, which codes for a transmembrane protein engaged in OT secretion processes. A common variation in this gene (rs3796863) was recently found to be associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Using an imaging genetics approach, we studied differential effects of an intranasal OT application on neural processing of social stimuli in 55 healthy young men depending on their CD38 gene variant in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design. Genotype had a significant influence on both behavioral and neuronal measures of social processing. Homozygotic risk allele carriers showed slower reaction times (RT) and higher activation of left fusiform gyrus during visual processing of social stimuli. Under OT activation differences between genotypes were more evident (though not statistically significantly increased) and RT were accelerated in homozygotic risk allele carriers. According to our data, rs3796863 mainly influences fusiform gyrus activation, an area which has been widely discussed in ASD research. OT seems to modulate this effect by enhancing activation differences between allele groups, which suggests an interaction between genetic makeup and OT availability on fusiform gyrus activation.

Deficits in the ability to recognize the emotions of others are believed to contribute to this. There is currently no effective treatment for these problems. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design, we administered oxytocin nasal spray (18 or 24 IU) or a placebo to 16 male youth aged 12 to 19 who were diagnosed with Autistic or Asperger's Disorder. Participants then completed the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task, a widely used and reliable test of emotion recognition. In comparison with placebo, oxytocin administration improved performance on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task. This effect was also shown when analysis was restricted to the younger participants aged 12 to 15 who received the lower dose. This study provides the first evidence that oxytocin nasal spray improves emotion recognition in young people diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders. Findings suggest the potential of earlier intervention and further evaluation of oxytocin nasal spray as a treatment to improve social communication and interaction in young people with autism spectrum disorders.","Guastella Adam J, Einfeld Stewart L, Gray Kylie M, Rinehart Nicole J, Tonge Bruce J, Lambert Timothy J, Hickie Ian B",Biological psychiatry,"Administration, Intranasal, Administration, Topical, Adolescent, Affect, Autistic Disorder, Child, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Oxytocin, Recognition, Psychology, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19897177,"Brain & Mind Research Institute, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2050, Australia. aguastella@med.usyd.edu.au"

Recent behavioral evidence shows that the neuropeptide oxytocin increases trust among humans, thus offering a unique chance of gaining a deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying trust and the adaptation to breach of trust. We examined the neural circuitry of trusting behavior by combining the intranasal, double-blind, administration of oxytocin with fMRI. We find that subjects in the oxytocin group show no change in their trusting behavior after they learned that their trust had been breached several times while subjects receiving placebo decrease their trust. This difference in trust adaptation is associated with a specific reduction in activation in the amygdala, the midbrain regions, and the dorsal striatum in subjects receiving oxytocin, suggesting that neural systems mediating fear processing (amygdala and midbrain regions) and behavioral adaptations to feedback information (dorsal striatum) modulate oxytocin's effect on trust. These findings may help to develop deeper insights into mental disorders such as social phobia and autism, which are characterized by persistent fear or avoidance of social interactions.","Baumgartner Thomas, Heinrichs Markus, Vonlanthen Aline, Fischbacher Urs, Fehr Ernst",Neuron,"Adaptation, Psychological, Adult, Analysis of Variance, Brain, Brain Mapping, Double-Blind Method, Games, Experimental, Humans, Image Processing, Computer-Assisted, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Nerve Net, Oxygen, Oxytocin, Psychometrics, Reaction Time, Risk-Taking, Surveys and Questionnaires, Trust",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18498743,"Center for the Study of Social and Neural Systems, Institute for Empirical Research in Economics, University of Zurich, Blumlisalpstrasse 10, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland. t.baumgartner@iew.uzh.ch"

All subjects showed improvements in affective speech comprehension from pre- to post-infusion; however, whereas those who received placebo first tended to revert to baseline after a delay, those who received oxytocin first retained the ability to accurately assign emotional significance to speech intonation on the speech comprehension task. These results are consistent with studies linking oxytocin to social recognition in rodents as well as studies linking oxytocin to prosocial behavior in humans and suggest that oxytocin might facilitate social information processing in those with autism.

After oral administration, RSP is completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and undergoes hydroxylation to yield 9-hydroxyrisperidone (9-OH-RSP), an active metabolite that has a pharmacologic profile and potency similar to RSP. The aims of this study were to compare the relative bioavailability of a pharmaceutical-equivalent (test) formulation with a reference formulation of oral RSP 2 mg, both available commercially on the Brazilian pharmaceutical market, and to generate data regarding the oral bioavailability of the tested drug in healthy Brazilian volunteers. This single-dose, randomized-sequence, open-label, 2-period crossover study was conducted in healthy Brazilian volunteers from August to December 2008. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive the test formulation followed by the reference formulation or vice versa, with a 30-day washout period between doses. Study drugs were administered after a 12-hour overnight fast. For pharmacokinetic analysis, blood samples were drawn at 0 (baseline), 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 3, 5, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours after administration. Plasma concentrations of RSP and 9-OH-RSP were determined using LC-MS/MS. The test and reference formulations were to be considered bioequivalent if the 90% CIs for the geometric mean test/reference ratios were within a predetermined range of 80% to 125%, in accordance with the policies of the Brazilian Sanitary Surveillance Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration. Tolerability was determined using clinical assessments, monitoring of vital signs, analysis of laboratory test results, and subject interviews regarding adverse events. A total of 22 subjects were enrolled (11 men, 11 women; mean [SD] age, 32 [12] years [range, 1858 years]; weight, 70.4 [11.9] kg [range, 50-103 kg]; height, 1.67 [0.08] m [range, 1.56-1.80 m]; and body mass index, 25 [4] kg/m(2) [range, 18-29 kg/m(2)]). For RSP, mean (SD) C(max) values were 12.6 (2.7) and 16.0 (2.3) ng/mL for the test and reference formulations, respectively. For 9-OH-RSP, mean Cmax values were 17.8 (1.3) and 21.0 (1.7) ng/mL for the test and reference formulations. The 90% CIs for the mean test/ reference ratios for RSP C(max), AUC(0-120), and AUC(0-∞) were 74% to 82%, 75% to 85%, and 76% to 85%, respectively, and 83% to 87%, 75% to 79%, and 75% to 78% for 9-OH-RSP. The related adverse events (headache, low back pain, drowsiness, standing hypotension, local postvenipuncture ecchymoses, insomnia, nausea, and vomiting) were transient and mild.

Our study aimed to compare gut microbiota composition between these disorders and evaluate the effect of probiotic supplementation. We conducted a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 80 children aged 5-14 years (39 with ADHD, 41 with ASD). Baseline and post-intervention fecal samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing to identify changes in gut microbiota composition. We identified 22 taxa differentiating ADHD and ASD (AUC = 0.939), characterised by increased presence of Clostridia, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae in ADHD, and Bacteroides, Bacilli and Actinobacteria in ASD. These differences remained after accounting for potential confounders. ASD children receiving probiotics had significant increases in Chao 1, Fisher's alpha, and Shannon indices whereas no significant differences in α and β-diversity were found in ADHD. In ADHD, bacteria with potential adverse effects were under-represented. In ASD, the abundance of Eggerthellaceae, and other taxa associated with gastrointestinal problems and anxiety was decreased. Variations in gut microbiota may influence responses in ADHD and ASD. Probiotic supplementation favorably altered gut microbiota composition, offering insights for future therapeutic strategies targeting the microbiome in neurodevelopmental disorders. Recent research underscores the role of gut microbiota in ADHD and ASD, indicating that diet can significantly influence microbiota composition and potentially manage these neurodevelopmental disorders. This study reveals distinct differences in gut microbiota composition between children with ADHD and ASD and demonstrates that probiotic supplementation can modulate specific microbial genera in each disorder. These findings pave the way for the development of innovative microbiome-targeted therapies, offering a new avenue for the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders. Understanding this relationship is crucial for designing future interventions.","Novau-Ferré Nil, Papandreou Christopher, Rojo-Marticella Meritxell, Canals-Sans Josefa, Bulló Mònica",Research in developmental disabilities,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40184961,"Nutrition and Metabolic Health Research Group (NuMeH).

Autism is a disorder with an increasing prevalence characterized by an enormous individual, family, and social cost. Although the etiology of autism spectrum disorder is unknown, an interaction between genetic and environmental factors is implicated, converging in altered brain synaptogenesis and, therefore, connectivity. Besides deepening the knowledge on the resting brain electrical activity that characterizes this disorder, this study allows analyzing the positive central effects of a 6-month therapy with a probiotic through a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study and the correlations between electroencephalography activity and biochemical and clinical parameters.

The aetiology and mechanisms of ASD are not yet fully understood, and current treatment comprises mainly education and rehabilitation, without significant improvement in the core symptoms. Recent studies suggest that microbiota change in children with ASD after the ingestion of probiotics may improve the balance of microbiota and thus ASD symptoms. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics on the symptoms of children with ASD and the possible mechanisms involved. This is a prospective controlled trial. A total of 160 children with ASD will be stratified and allocated to placebo and probiotics groups randomised according to the severity of their ASD symptoms. The probiotics group will be given probiotics supplements orally twice a day for 3 months and the control group will be given a placebo at the same amount, in addition to the baseline therapy of education and rehabilitation. All the children will be evaluated systematically by using different scales, questionnaires before, during, and after 3 months' treatment, as well as 3 months after discontinuation. The potential impact of probiotics on immunity and inflammation, metabolism, and metagenome will also be investigated. Our previous study showed that the abundance of intestinal flora was greatly different in children with ASD, and that Bifidobacterium was associated with the severity of ASD. In the present study, we will investigate the impact of probiotics supplementation on the symptoms of Children with ASD, with the purpose of evaluating the possible therapeutic effects of additives on ASD and of providing a reference for clinical treatment. The results will help to disclose as yet unknown relationship between probiotics and ASD.

In this framework, probiotics (recently named ""psychobiotics"") may modulate brain activity and function, possibly improving the behavioral profiles of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We evaluated the effects of probiotics on autism in a double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 85 preschoolers with ASD (mean age, 4.2 years; 84% boys). Participants were randomly assigned to probiotics (De Simone Formulation) (n=42) or placebo (n=43) for six months. Sixty-three (74%) children completed the trial. No differences between groups were detected on the primary outcome measure, the Total Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule - Calibrated Severity Score (ADOS-CSS). An exploratory secondary analysis on subgroups of children with or without Gastrointestinal Symptoms (GI group, n= 30; NGI group, n=55) revealed in the NGI group treated with probiotics a significant decline in ADOS scores as compared to that in the placebo group, with a mean reduction of 0.81 in Total ADOS CSS and of 1.14 in Social-Affect ADOS CSS over six months. In the GI group treated with probiotics we found greater improvements in some GI symptoms, adaptive functioning, and sensory profiles than in the GI group treated with placebo. These results suggest potentially positive effects of probiotics on core autism symptoms in a subset of ASD children independent of the specific intermediation of the probiotic effect on GI symptoms.

However, few studies were placebo-controlled, and there is no study on persons with an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis. Our aim was to study effects of Synbiotic 2000 on psychiatric symptoms and functioning in children and adults with ADHD without an autism diagnosis. Children and adults (n = 182) with an ADHD diagnosis completed the nine weeks randomized double-blind parallel placebo-controlled trial examining effects of Synbiotic 2000 on the primary endpoints ADHD symptoms, autism symptoms and daily functioning, and the secondary endpoint emotion regulation, measured using the questionnaires SNAP-IV, ASRS, WFIRS, SCQ, AQ and DERS-16. Levels at baseline of plasma C-reactive protein and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), central to leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion facilitating inflammatory responses in tissues, were measured using Meso Scale Discovery. Synbiotic 2000 and placebo improved ADHD symptoms equally well, and neither active treatment nor placebo had any statistically significant effect on functioning or sub-diagnostic autism symptoms. However, Synbiotic 2000, specifically, reduced sub-diagnostic autism symptoms in the domain restricted, repetitive and stereotyped behaviors in children, and improved emotion regulation in the domain of goal-directed behavior in adults. In children with elevated sVCAM-1 levels at baseline as well as in children without ADHD medication, Synbiotic 2000 reduced both the total score of autism symptoms, and the restricted, repetitive and stereotyped behaviors. In adults with elevated sVCAM-1 at baseline, Synbiotic 2000 significantly improved emotion regulation, both the total score and four of the five subdomains. To conclude, while no definite Synbiotic 2000-specific effect was detected, the analysis of those with elevated plasma sVCAM-1 levels proposed a reduction of autism symptoms in children and an improvement of emotion regulation in adults with ADHD.

Manipulation of the gut microbiome with probiotics may be a therapeutic strategy with the potential to relieve gastrointestinal (GI) comorbidities and improve psychiatric symptoms. Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, commensal yeast species, can be imbalanced in the unhealthy human microbiome, and these fungal exposures were previously found elevated in schizophrenia. In a longitudinal, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot investigation of 56 outpatients with schizophrenia, we examined the impact of probiotic treatment on yeast antibody levels, and the relationship between treatment and antibody levels on bowel discomfort and psychiatric symptoms. We found that probiotic treatment significantly reduced C. albicans antibodies over the 14-week study period in males, but not in females. Antibody levels of S. cerevisiae were not altered in either treatment group. The highest levels of bowel discomfort over time occurred in C. albicans-seropositive males receiving the placebo. We observed trends towards improvement in positive psychiatric symptoms in males treated with probiotics who were seronegative for C. albicans. Results from this pilot study hint at an association of C. albicans seropositivity with worse positive psychiatric symptoms, which was confirmed in a larger cohort of 384 males with schizophrenia.

The GI disturbances in ASD might be linked to gut dysbiosis representing the observable phenotype of a ""gut-brain axis"" disruption. The exploitation of strategies which can restore normal gut microbiota and reduce the gut production and absorption of toxins, such as probiotics addition/supplementation in a diet, may represent a non-pharmacological option in the treatment of GI disturbances in ASD. The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to determine the effects of supplementation with a probiotic mixture (Vivomixx®) in ASD children not only on specific GI symptoms, but also on the core deficits of the disorder, on cognitive and language development, and on brain function and connectivity. An ancillary aim is to evaluate possible effects of probiotic supplementation on urinary concentrations of phthalates (chemical pollutants) which have been previously linked to ASD. A group of 100 preschoolers with ASD will be classified as belonging to a GI group or to a Non-GI (NGI) group on the basis of a symptom severity index specific to GI disorders. In order to obtain four arms, subjects belonging to the two groups (GI and NGI) will be blind randomized 1:1 to regular diet with probiotics or with placebo for 6 months.

Whereas current pharmacological interventions for ASD focus primarily on psychiatric symptoms, including agitation and obsessive behaviors, few agents target core symptomatology. It has been previously hypothesized that abnormalities in facial scanning, such as reduced eye contact or increased mouth fixation, contribute to social communication deficits in ASD. In addition, previous reports have suggested elevated stress and anxiety in ASD, symptoms that are believed to impact facial scanning patterns. The present pilot study sought to explore the effects of pharmacological intervention via propranolol, a nonselective β-adrenergic antagonist and known anxiolytic, on facial scanning in ASD. Specifically, we wished to determine whether there is an increase in eye contact and a decrease in mouth fixation with administration of propranolol. A sample of 14 participants with ASD and 14 matched controls participated in two study sessions in which propranolol and placebo were administered in a counterbalanced, double-blinded manner. At each session, ocular fixation data were collected during presentation of video stimuli of 16 human faces. Fixation time on the eye, nose, and mouth regions of the face stimuli was analyzed. The baseline fixation patterns for the ASD and control groups did not significantly differ; however, administration of propranolol was associated with a significant reduction in mouth fixation for the ASD group. Additionally, mouth fixation was positively related to nonverbal communication impairment in the ASD group.

The present study examined the effects of pharmacological modulation of the norepinephrine system on the severity of such impairments. A sample of 14 high-functioning adults with ASD and a demographically-matched comparison group of 13 typically developing individuals participated. An AX continuous performance test (AX-CPT) was used to evaluate working memory and inhibitory control. AX-CPT performance was assessed following administration of a single dose of propranolol (a beta adrenergic antagonist) and following placebo (sugar pill) administration. Individuals with ASD performed more poorly than non-ASD individuals in the working memory condition (BX trials). Importantly, administration of propranolol attenuated this impairment, with the ASD group performing significantly better in the propranolol condition than the placebo condition. Working memory performance of the non-ASD group was unaffected by propranolol/placebo administration. No group or medication effects were observed for the inhibition condition (AY trials). The present findings suggest that norepinephrine may play a role in some, but not necessarily all, cognitive impairments associated with ASD.

Preliminary evidence showed possible language benefits in autism from the β-adrenergic antagonist propranolol.

Therefore, we wished to determine whether this benefit of propranolol includes an effect on semantic fluency in autism. A sample of 14 high-functioning adolescent and adult participants with autism and 14 matched controls were given letter and category word fluency tasks on 2 separate testing sessions; 1 test was given 60 minutes after the administration of 40 mg propranolol orally, and 1 test was given after placebo, administered in a double-blinded, counterbalanced manner. Participants with autism were significantly impaired compared with controls on both fluency tasks. Propranolol significantly improved performance on category fluency, but not letter fluency among autism participants. No drug effect was observed among controls. Expected drug effects on heart rate and blood pressure were observed in both the groups. Results are consistent with a selective beneficial effect of propranolol on flexibility of access to semantic and associative networks in autism, with no observed effect on phonological networks.

However, no intrastimulation social cognition training for ASD has been developed so far. The objective of this two-armed, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial is to investigate the effects of tDCS combined with a newly developed intrastimulation social cognition training on adolescents with ASD. Twenty-two male adolescents with ASD were randomly assigned to receive 10 sessions of either anodal or sham tDCS at F3/right supraorbital region together with online intrastimulation training comprising basic and complex emotion recognition tasks. Using baseline magnetic resonance imaging data, individual electric field distributions were simulated, and brain activation patterns of the training tasks were analyzed. Additionally, questionnaires were administered at baseline and following the intervention. Compared to sham tDCS, anodal tDCS significantly improved dynamic emotion recognition over the course of the sessions. This task also showed the highest activations in face processing regions. Moreover, the improvement was associated with electric field density at the medial prefrontal cortex and social awareness in exploratory analyses. Both groups showed high tolerability and acceptability of tDCS, and significant improvement in overall ASD symptoms. Taken together, multisession tDCS improved dynamic emotion recognition in adolescents with ASD using a task that activates brain regions associated with the social brain network. The variability in the electric field might diminish tDCS effects and future studies should investigate individualized approaches.","Prillinger Karin, Amador de Lara Gabriel, Klöbl Manfred, Lanzenberger Rupert, Plener Paul L, Poustka Luise, Konicar Lilian, Radev Stefan T",Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics,"Humans, Male, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation, Adolescent, Double-Blind Method, Emotions, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Recognition, Psychology, Child, Social Cognition",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39393982,"Comprehensive Center for Clinical Neuroscience and Mental Health (C3NMH), Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria; Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria; Comprehensive Center for Pediatrics (CCP), Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria; Comprehensive Center for Clinical Neuroscience and Mental Health (C3NMH), Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Ulm, 89073 Ulm, Germany.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, University Hospital Heidelberg, 69115 Heidelberg, Germany.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria; Comprehensive Center for Pediatrics (CCP), Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria; Comprehensive Center for Clinical Neuroscience and Mental Health (C3NMH), Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.; Cognitive Science Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 12180 Troy, New York, USA; Center for Modeling, Simulation and Imaging in Medicine (CEMSIM), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 12180 Troy, New York, USA.; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria; Comprehensive Center for Pediatrics (CCP), Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria; Comprehensive Center for Clinical Neuroscience and Mental Health (C3NMH), Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a promising and emerging tool for the intervention of ASD by reducing both core and associate symptoms. Several reviews have been published regarding TMS-based ASD treatment, however, a systematic review on study characteristics, specific stimulating parameters, localization techniques, stimulated targets, behavioral outcomes, and neuroimage biomarker changes is lagged behind since 2018. Here, we performed a systematic search on literatures published after 2018 in PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct. After screening, the final systematic review included 17 articles, composing seven randomized controlled trial studies and ten open-label studies. Two studies are double-blind, while the other studies have a moderate to high risk of bias attributing to inadequate subject- and evaluator-blinding to treatment allocation. Five studies utilize theta-burst stimulation mode, and the others apply repetitive TMS with low frequency (five studies), high frequency (six studies), and combined low and high frequency stimulation (one study). Most researchers prioritize the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal lobe as stimulation target, while parietal lobule, inferior parietal lobule, and posterior superior temporal sulci have also emerged as new targets of attention. One third of the studies use neuronavigation based on anatomical magnetic resonance imaging to locate the stimulation target. After TMS intervention, discernible enhancements across a spectrum of scales are evident in stereotyped behavior, repetitive behavior, and verbal social domains. A comprehensive review of literature spanning the last five years demonstrates the potential of TMS treatment for ASD in ameliorating the clinical core symptoms.","Yuan Li-Xia, Wang Xing-Ke, Yang Chen, Zhang Qiu-Rong, Ma Sheng-Zhi, Zang Yu-Feng, Dong Wen-Qiang",Heliyon,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38933955,"School of Physics, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.; Center for Cognition and Brain Disorders, The Affiliated Hospital of Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China."

Participants were from the NIMH funded RUPP multisite, randomized, double-blind trial that compared risperidone to placebo to treat autistic disorder with severe tantrums, aggression, or self-injury. Participants were aged 5 to 17, and randomly assigned to risperidone (n=49) or placebo (n=52). Baseline and change scores were computed with the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) parent assessed scales with irritability as the primary outcome, as well as the clinician assessed ABC Irritability subscale, and Clinical Global Impression Scale. The relationship between baseline severity and change scores for the risperdone and placebo groups was examined with eight competing three-level mixed-effects models for repeated measure models. Significant (P<0.01) interactions between treatment and baseline severity were observed for parent ABC ratings of irritability and lethargy only. Greater magnitudes of the differences between risperidone and placebo were observed from moderate to very severe baseline severity on irritability and lethargy.

In this 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, risperidone/placebo solution (0.01-0.06 mg/kg/day) was administered to 79 children who were aged 5 to 12 years and had PDD. Behavioral symptoms were assessed using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form, and Clinical Global Impression-Change. Safety assessments included vital signs, electrocardiogram, extrapyramidal symptoms, adverse events, and laboratory tests. Subjects who were taking risperidone (mean dosage: 0.04 mg/kg/day; 1.17 mg/day) experienced a significantly greater mean decrease on the irritability subscale of the ABC (primary endpoint) compared with those who were taking placebo. By study endpoint, risperidone-treated subjects exhibited a 64% improvement over baseline in the irritability score almost double that of placebo-treated subjects (31%). Risperidone-treated subjects also exhibited significantly greater decreases on the other 4 subscales of the ABC; on the conduct problem, insecure/anxious, hyperactive, and overly sensitive subscales of the Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form (parent version); and on the Visual Analog Scale of the most troublesome symptom.

We conducted a multisite, randomized, double-blind trial of risperidone as compared with placebo for the treatment of autistic disorder accompanied by severe tantrums, aggression, or self-injurious behavior in children 5 to 17 years old. The primary outcome measures were the score on the Irritability subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist and the rating on the Clinical Global Impressions - Improvement (CGI-I) scale at eight weeks. A total of 101 children (82 boys and 19 girls; mean [+/-SD] age, 8.8+/-2.7 years) were randomly assigned to receive risperidone (49 children) or placebo (52).

The rate of a positive response, defined as at least a 25 percent decrease in the Irritability score and a rating of much improved or very much improved on the CGI-I scale, was 69 percent in the risperidone group (34 of 49 children had a positive response) and 12 percent in the placebo group (6 of 52, P<0.001).

Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology.,2000-04-01,"Assessment of autistic disorder (autism) symptoms, primary and secondary, poses more challenging problems than ordinarily found in multisite randomized clinical trial (RCT) assessments. For example, subjects may be uncommunicative and extremely heterogeneous in problem presentation, and current pharmacological treatments are not likely to alter most core features of autism. The Autism Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology (RUPP Autism Network) resolved some of these problems during the design of a risperidone RCT in children/adolescents. The inappropriateness of the usual anchors for a Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) was resolved by defining uncomplicated autism without secondary symptoms as a CGI-S of 3, mildly ill. The communication problems, compromising use of the patient as an informant, were addressed by several strategies, including careful questioning of care providers, rating scales, laboratory tests, and physical exams. The broad subject heterogeneity requires outcome measures sensitive to individual change over a wide spectrum of treatment response and side effects. The problems of neuropsychologically testing nonverbal, lower functioning, sometimes noncompliant subjects requires careful instrument selection/adaptation and flexible administration techniques. The problems of assessing low-end IQs, neglected by most standardized test developers, was resolved by an algorithm of test hierarchy. Scarcity of other autism-adapted cognitive and neuropsychological tests and lack of standardization required development of a new, specially adapted battery. Reliability on the Autism Diagnostic Interview (currently the most valid diagnostic instrument) and other clinician instruments required extensive cross-site training (in-person, videotape, and teleconference sessions). Definition of a treatment responder required focus on individually relevant target symptoms, synthesis of possible modest improvements in many domains, and acceptance of attainable though imperfect goals. The assessment strategy developed is implemented in a RCT of risperidone (McDougle et al., 2000) for which the design and other methodological challenges are described elsewhere (Scahill et al., 2000).

After recent publicity about a child with autism whose condition markedly improved after a single dose of secretin, thousands of children with autistic disorders may have received secretin injections. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a single intravenous dose of synthetic human secretin in 60 children (age, 3 to 14 years) with autism or pervasive developmental disorder. The children were randomly assigned to treatment with an intravenous infusion of synthetic human secretin (0.4 microg per kilogram of body weight) or saline placebo. We used standardized behavioral measures of the primary and secondary features of autism, including the Autism Behavior Checklist, to assess the degree of impairment at base line and over the course of a four-week period after treatment. Of the 60 children, 4 could not be evaluated - 2 received secretin outside the study, and 2 did not return for follow-up. Thus, 56 children (28 in each group) completed the study. As compared with placebo, secretin treatment was not associated with significant improvements in any of the outcome measures. Among the children in the secretin group, the mean total score on the Autism Behavior Checklist at base line was 59.0 (range of possible values, 0 to 158, with a larger value corresponding to greater impairment), and among those in the placebo group it was 63.2.

Sulforaphane, a supplement with indirect antioxidant effects that are derived from broccoli sprouts and seeds, was recently shown to lead to improvements in behavior and social responsiveness in children with ASD. We conducted the current open-label study to determine if we could identify changes in urinary metabolites that were associated with clinical improvements with the goal of identifying a potential mechanism of action. Children and young adults enrolled in a school for children with ASD and related neurodevelopmental disorders were recruited to participate in a 12-week, open-label study of sulforaphane. Fasting urinary metabolites and measures of behavior (Aberrant Behavior Checklist-ABC) and social responsiveness (Social Responsiveness Scale-SRS) were measured at baseline and at the end of the study. Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated for the pre- to post-intervention change in each of the two clinical scales (ABS and SRS) versus the change in each metabolite. Fifteen children completed the 12-week study. Mean scores on both symptom measures showed improvements (decreases) over the study period, but only the change in the SRS was significant. The ABC improved - 7.1 points (95% CI - 17.4 to 3.2), and the SRS improved - 9.7 points (95% CI - 18.7 to - 0.8). We identified 77 urinary metabolites that were correlated with changes in symptoms, and they clustered into pathways of oxidative stress, amino acid/gut microbiome, neurotransmitters, hormones, and sphingomyelin metabolism. Urinary metabolomics analysis is a useful tool to identify pathways that may be involved in the mechanism of action of treatments targeting abnormal physiology in ASD.

This multicenter, double-blind, 2-armed, sham-controlled randomized clinical trial, conducted from May 1, 2022, through November 30, 2023, assessed children aged 3 to 14 years with ASD at 8 medical centers in China. Participants underwent daily 20-minute sessions of active tPCS (0.7 mA) or sham tPCS (brief 0.7 mA ramp-up and ramp-down) for 20 sessions over 4 weeks with anode over the right cerebellar hemisphere and cathode over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (12.56-cm2-circular, 4-cm-diameter circular electrodes). Each day after tPCS, all participants received 1 hour of standard therapy. Social functioning was assessed using the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included the Autism Behavior Checklist and the Childhood Sleep Habits Questionnaire.

Therapies specifically targeting RBs have been underexplored despite advances in understanding their neurobiological basis. This study aims to evaluate whether high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) can reduce dysfunctional RBs in autistic children and investigate whether improvements differ between lower-order and higher-order RBs based on the brain regions stimulated. The study entails a multi-session, sham-controlled, site-controlled, double-blind, and between-subjects design. The study will include participants with an ASD diagnosis (aged 8-13 years; IQ ≥ 70), who will undergo the HD-tDCS intervention for 10 sessions. Participants will be randomly assigned to three conditions: (1) Pre-Motor Active Group (active HD-tDCS over pre-SMA cortex); (2) Frontal Active Group (active HD-tDCS over dlPFC); (3) Placebo Control Group. In the active HD-tDCS conditions, the current will be delivered through a 4 × 1 montage; small circular electrodes will be used with the cathode placed centrally with a current intensity of 0.5 mA for a total of 20 min (30 s ramp up/down) per session. Participants during the sham condition will undergo the same procedures as those in the both active conditions actual placement of electrodes, and turning on the HD-tDCS equipment (30 s). The assessment will be completed at baseline (T0), immediately after the end of the intervention (T1) and 3 months after the end of the intervention (T2). The primary outcome measure will be the Total Score of the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised. The secondary outcomes measures will comprise ASD symptoms, sensory processing pattern, emotional/behavioral problems, sleep functioning, parental stress, neuropsychological features and High-Density EEG connectivity. We hypothesize that active HD-tDCS will lead to significant reduction in the total score of the primary outcome compared to Sham Group, with site-specific effects on lower-order and higher-order RBs. HD-tDCS is an easy-to-deliver, time-efficient, neurobiologically-driven intervention that could be performed as add-on to reduce the time of conventional therapy for ASD.

In recent years, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been applied in interventions for ASD, often targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). However, studies investigating anodal and cathodal tDCS interventions have reported differing outcomes. Therefore, this study aimed to compare and analyze the effects of these two stimulations through a randomized controlled trial, utilizing both behavioral assessments and EEG proxy markers capable of characterizing the brain's excitatory-inhibitory balance. This study recruited a total of 24 children with ASD (20 males and 4 females; mean age ± SD: 5.5 ± 1.2 years), who were randomly divided into two groups receiving either anodal or cathodal tDCS targeting the DLPFC. The stimulation intensity was set at 1 mA, administered five times per week for a total of 20 sessions. Behavioral intervention outcomes were assessed using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and the Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC). Additionally, the study evaluated the effects of tDCS on the brain's excitatory-inhibitory balance by analyzing corrected periodic alpha oscillation power and bandwidth, as well as non-periodic exponent and offset derived from EEG data. Following anodal tDCS intervention, results from the SRS scale indicated a decrease in overall scores, with significant differences observed in social communication and social motivation among children. On the ABC scale, overall scores also decreased, with significant differences noted in sensory behavior, social relating, body and object use, and language and communication skills. Non-periodic exponent and offsets increased following anodal tDCS stimulation, whereas they decreased after cathodal tDCS stimulation. Regarding alpha oscillation power, there was a significant increase following anodal tDCS and a significant decrease following cathodal tDCS. In terms of alpha oscillation bandwidth, there was a reduction following anodal tDCS and an increase following cathodal tDCS. Further correlation analysis revealed that in children who received anodal tDCS intervention, non-periodic exponent showed correlations with behaviors such as social communication. Our study results demonstrated that anodal and cathodal tDCS targeting the left DLPFC had distinct effects on the behavior and excitatory-inhibitory balance of children with ASD. Anodal tDCS intervention appeared to have a more positive impact compared to cathodal intervention. However, the sample size was small, and we focused solely on the effects of tDCS, with our experimental design perhaps not being able to generalize to all external manipulations of excitability in our study. In future research, we will continue to improve the experiments to address these limitations.","Kang Jiannan, Wu Juanmei, Huang Xinping, Mao Wenqin, Li Xiaoli",IBRO neuroscience reports,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39896718,"Child Rehabilitation Division, Ningbo Rehabilitation Hospital, Ningbo, China.; State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Beijing, China."

The combination of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and inhibitory control training produces good transfer effects and improves neuroplasticity. However, no studies have explored whether applying tDCS over the dlPFC improves inhibitory control and produces transfer effects in children with ASD. To explore whether multisession tDCS could enhance inhibitory control training (response inhibition), near-transfer (interference control) and far-transfer effects (sustained attention; stability of attention) in children with ASD and the generalizability of training effects in daily life and the class, as reflected by behavioral performance and neural activity measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Twenty-eight autistic children were randomly assigned to either the true or sham tDCS group. The experimental group received bifrontal tDCS stimulation at 1.5 mA, administered for 15 min daily across eight consecutive days. tDCS was delivered during a computerized Go/No-go training task. Behavioral performance in terms of inhibitory control (Dog/Monkey and Day/Night Stroop tasks), sustained attention (Continuous Performance and Cancellation tests), prefrontal cortex (PFC) neural activity and inhibitory control and sustained attention in the class and at home were evaluated. Training (response inhibition) and transfer effects (interference control; sustained attention) were significantly greater after receiving tDCS during the Go/No-go training task than after receiving sham tDCS. Changes in oxyhemoglobin (HbO) concentrations in the dlPFC and FPA associated with consistent conditions in the Day/Night Stroop and Continuous Performance test were observed after applying tDCS during the inhibitory control training task. Notably, transfer effects can be generalized to classroom environments.

It facilitates empathy, emotion regulation, and prosocial commitment. Mental disorders characterized by social interaction dysfunction, such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD), and Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), often exhibit atypical synchronization with others across multiple levels. With the introduction of the ""second-person"" neuroscience perspective, our understanding of interpersonal neural synchronization (INS) has improved, however, so far, it has hardly impacted the development of novel therapeutic interventions. To evaluate the potential of INS-based treatments for mental disorders, we performed two systematic literature searches identifying studies that directly target INS through neurofeedback (12 publications; 9 independent studies) or brain stimulation techniques (7 studies), following PRISMA guidelines. In addition, we narratively review indirect INS manipulations through behavioral, biofeedback, or hormonal interventions. We discuss the potential of such treatments for ASD, RAD, and SAD and using a systematic database search assess the acceptability of neurofeedback (4 studies) and neurostimulation (4 studies) in patients with social dysfunction. Although behavioral approaches, such as engaging in eye contact or cooperative actions, have been shown to be associated with increased INS, little is known about potential long-term consequences of such interventions. Few proof-of-concept studies have utilized brain stimulation techniques, like transcranial direct current stimulation or INS-based neurofeedback, showing feasibility and preliminary evidence that such interventions can boost behavioral synchrony and social connectedness. Yet, optimal brain stimulation protocols and neurofeedback parameters are still undefined. For ASD, RAD, or SAD, so far no randomized controlled trial has proven the efficacy of direct INS-based intervention techniques, although in general brain stimulation and neurofeedback methods seem to be well accepted in these patient groups. Significant work remains to translate INS-based manipulations into effective treatments for social interaction disorders. Future research should focus on mechanistic insights into INS, technological advancements, and rigorous design standards. Furthermore, it will be key to compare interventions directly targeting INS to those targeting other modalities of synchrony as well as to define optimal target dyads and target synchrony states in clinical interventions.","Konrad Kerstin, Gerloff Christian, Kohl Simon H, Mehler David M A, Mehlem Lena, Volbert Emily L, Komorek Maike, Henn Alina T, Boecker Maren, Weiss Eileen, Reindl Vanessa",Frontiers in neuroscience,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38529267,"Child Neuropsychology Section, Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy, University Hospital RWTH, Aachen, Germany.; Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, Medical School, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany."

No significant differences were observed between groups A and B (p = 0.296), or between groups B and C (p = 0.140). Ten sessions of anodal tDCS to the LDLPFC led to improved non-verbal intelligence among individuals with ASD.

The development of treatments that target common neural circuit dysfunctions caused by known genetic defects, namely, disruption of the excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance, is promising. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is capable of modulating the E/I balance in healthy individuals, yet its clinical and neurobiological effects in ASD remain elusive. This double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial investigated the effects of multisession cathodal prefrontal tDCS coupled with online cognitive remediation on social functioning, information processing efficiency and the E/I balance in ASD patients aged 14-21 years. Sixty individuals were randomly assigned to receive either active or sham tDCS (10 sessions in total, 20 min/session, stimulation intensity: 1.5 mA, cathode: F3, anode: Fp2, size of electrodes: 25 cm<sup>2</sup>) combined with 20 min of online cognitive remediation. Social functioning, information processing efficiency during cognitive tasks, and theta- and gamma-band E/I balance were measured one day before and after the treatment.

Hence, developing effective treatment protocols is urgently needed. Given emerging evidence shows that the abnormal connections of the frontal brain regions contribute to the manifestations of ASD behavioral and cognitive impairments, noninvasive treatment modalities that are capable in modulating brain connections, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), have been postulated to be potentially promising for alleviating core symptoms in ASD. However, whether tDCS can reduce behavioral symptoms and enhance cognitive performance in ASD remains unclear. This randomized controlled trial involving 105 adolescents and young adults with ASD showed that multiple sessions of a tDCS protocol, which was paired up with computerized cognitive training, was effective in improving social functioning in adolescents and young adults with ASD.

Cerebellum is best known for its role in controlling motor behaviors; however, recently, there have been significant reports showed that dysfunction in cerebellar-cerebral networks contributes significantly to many of the clinical features of ASD. Hereby, this is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) study examining the potential modulating effects of bilateral anodal tDCS stimulation over cerebellar hemispheres on the resting-state brain complexity in children with ASD. Thirty-six children with ASD (aged 4-14) years old were divided equally and randomly into a tDCS treatment group, which underwent 10 sessions (20-min duration, five sessions/per week) of bilateral anodal tDCS stimulation applied over left and right cerebellar hemispheres, and control group underwent the same procedures, but with sham tDCS stimulation. Resting-state brain complexity was evaluated through recording and calculating the approximate entropy (ApxEnt) values of the resting-state electroencephalograph (EEG) data obtained from a 64-channel EEG system before and after the interventions. Repeated measures of ANOVA showed that tDCS had significant effects on the treatment group (Wilks' Lambda = 0.29, F (15, 16) = 2.67, p = 0.03) compared with the control group. Analyzed data showed a significant increase in the averaged ApxEnt values in the right frontal cortical region (F (1, 16) = 10.46, p = 0.005) after the bilateral cerebellar anodal tDCS stimulation. Besides, the Cohen's d effect size showed a large effect size (0.70-0.92) of bilateral cerebellar anodal tDCS on the ApxEnt values increases in the left and right frontal cortical regions, the right central cortical region, and left parietal cortical region. However, there were no any significant differences or increases in the brain complexity before and after the sham tDCS stimulation of the control group. Bilateral cerebellar anodal tDCS modulated and increased the brain complexity in children with ASD with no any reported adverse effect.

One of these approaches is modulation of activity of the brain regions involved in ASD symptoms. This study examined the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on autism symptom severity, theory of mind, emotion regulation strategies, and emotional-behavioral functions in children with ASD. Thirty-two children (M<sub>age</sub>  = 10.16, SD = 1.93, range 7-12 years) diagnosed with ASD were randomly assigned to active (N = 17) or sham stimulation (N = 15) groups in a randomized, sham-controlled, parallel-group design. Participants underwent 10 sessions of active (1.5 mA, 15 min, bilateral left anodal/right cathodal DLPFC, 2 sessions per week) or sham tDCS. Autism symptom severity, theory of mind, emotion regulation strategies, and emotional-behavioral functioning of the patients were assessed at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and 1 month after the intervention. A significant improvement of autism symptom severity (i.e., communication), theory of mind (i.e., ToM 3), and emotion regulation strategies was observed for the active as compared to the sham stimulation group at the end of the intervention, and these effects were maintained at the one-month follow-up. The results suggest that repeated tDCS with anodal stimulation of left and cathodal stimulation of right DLPFC improves autism symptom severity as well as social cognition and emotion regulation in ASD. LAY SUMMARY: Previous research has suggested that targeting core mechanisms underlying cognitive-emotional and behavioral deficits of autistic children might improve symptoms of ASD. Deficient social and behavioral functioning, impaired theory of mind, and emotional regulation deficits have been identified as core treatment targets for this group. Specific subregions of the prefrontal cortex are involved in these deficits, including hypoactivity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Upregulation of this area with non-invasive brain stimulation, namely anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), results in improved social and behavioral functioning in children with ASD. Very few studies have however examined the effects of this intervention on theory of mind, emotional regulation, and emotional-behavioral problems. We examined the effects of anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC (F3), combined with cathodal tDCS over the right DLPFC (F4) on autism symptom severity as well as theory of mind, emotional regulation, and emotional-behavioral problems of children with ASD. This intervention improved autism symptom severity, specific domains of theory of mind, and emotion regulation. These findings have clinical implications for the treatment of ASD and suggest that targeting core mechanisms underlying socio-cognitive-emotional deficits of autistic children using tDCS might improve symptoms of ASD.","Zemestani Mehdi, Hoseinpanahi Omid, Salehinejad Mohammad Ali, Nitsche Michael A",Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research,"Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Child, Emotional Regulation, Humans, Prefrontal Cortex, Theory of Mind, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36069668,"Department of Psychology, University of Kurdistan, Sanandaj, Iran.; Department of Psychology and Neurosciences, Leibniz Research Centre for Working Environment and Human Factors, Dortmund, Germany."

34018333,10.1002/Aur.2538,"Contribution of the right temporoparietal junction and ventromedial prefrontal cortex to theory of mind in autism: A randomized, sham-controlled tDCS study.",2021-08-01,"Theory of mind (ToM) is the ability to attribute subjective mental states to oneself and others and is significantly impaired in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A frontal-posterior network of regions including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is involved in ToM. Previous studies show an underactivation of these regions in ASD. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation method for causally investigating brain-behavior relationships via induction of cortical excitability alterations. tDCS, mostly over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, has been increasingly applied for improving behavioral problems in ASD leaving other potentially interesting regions untouched. Here we investigated contribution of the vmPFC and right TPJ in ToM abilities of ASD children via tDCS in a pilot study. Sixteen children with ASD (mean age = 10.7 ± 1.9) underwent three tDCS sessions (1 mA, 20 min) in a randomized, sham-controlled design. Stimulation protocols included: (a) anodal vmPFC tDCS, (b) anodal r-TPJ tDCS, and (c) sham tDCS. ToM abilities were explored during tDCS using the theory of mind test (TOMT). Our results show that activation of the vmPFC with anodal tDCS significantly improved ToM in children with ASD compared with both, r-TPJ tDCS, and sham stimulation. Specifically, precursors of ToM (e.g., emotion recognition, perception, and imitation) and elementary ToM skills (e.g., first-order mental state reasoning) were significantly improved by anodal vmPFC tDCS. Based on these results, the vmPFC could be a potential target region for the reduction of ASD symptoms via noninvasive brain stimulation, which should be examined in larger detail in future studies. LAY SUMMARY: Theory of mind (ToM) is the ability to infer mental states of oneself and others, which is impaired in autism. Brain imaging studies have shown involvement of two brain regions in ToM (ventromedial prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal junction) which are underactivated in autism. We increased activation of these regions via noninvasive brain stimulation in this experiment to see how it would affect ToM abilities in autism.

To date, there is no effective medication that can improve social communication and interaction in ASD, and effect sizes of behaviour-based psychotherapy remain in the low to medium range. Consequently, there is a clear need for new treatment options. ASD is associated with altered activation and connectivity patterns in brain areas which process social information. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a technique that applies a weak electrical current to the brain in order to modulate neural excitability and alter connectivity. Combined with specific cognitive tasks, it allows to facilitate and consolidate the respective training effects. Therefore, application of tDCS in brain areas relevant to social cognition in combination with a specific cognitive training is a promising treatment approach for ASD. A phase-IIa pilot randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, parallel-group clinical study is presented, which aims at investigating if 10 days of 20-min multi-channel tDCS stimulation of the bilateral tempo-parietal junction (TPJ) at 2.0 mA in combination with a computer-based cognitive training on perspective taking, intention and emotion understanding, can improve social cognitive abilities in children and adolescents with ASD. The main objectives are to describe the change in parent-rated social responsiveness from baseline (within 1 week before first stimulation) to post-intervention (within 7 days after last stimulation) and to monitor safety and tolerability of the intervention. Secondary objectives include the evaluation of change in parent-rated social responsiveness at follow-up (4 weeks after end of intervention), change in other ASD core symptoms and psychopathology, social cognitive abilities and neural functioning post-intervention and at follow-up in order to explore underlying neural and cognitive mechanisms. If shown, positive results regarding change in parent-rated social cognition and favourable safety and tolerability of the intervention will confirm tDCS as a promising treatment for ASD core-symptoms. This may be a first step in establishing a new and cost-efficient intervention for individuals with ASD. The trial is registered with the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS), DRKS00014732 .

Subsequently, the effect of single-session tDCS on ASD in SZ patients (N = 24) with AVH was examined in a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, cross-over design. The true and sham tDCS were administered (anode at the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and cathode at the left temporoparietal junction) on two different days. ASD task was performed before and after each session of tDCS. Auditory hallucination rating scores correlated significantly with false alarm rate, discriminability index, and response bias. SZ patients had a significantly lesser discriminability index in ASD than HC. Single-session tDCS (true versus sham) did not have any significant effect on ASD in SZ patients. The study findings support the pathogenetic role of ASD in AVH in SZ.

Fifty children with confirmed ASD medical diagnoses were divided equally and randomly into a tDCS treatment group and a control group. The tDCS treatment group underwent 10 sessions (20-min durations, five per week) of bilateral anodal tDCS stimulation applied simultaneously over the left and right prefrontal and motor areas, whereas the control group underwent the same procedures but with the use of sham tDCS stimulation. Total scores and sub-scores of autism treatment evaluation checklist (ATEC) (language and communication; sociability; sensory awareness; and behavioral, health, and physical conditions) were measured before and after the tDCS treatment sessions of both groups. There were significant decreases in total ATEC scores (P = 0.014), sociability sub-scores (P = 0.021), and behavioral, health, and physical condition sub-scores (P = 0.011) in the tDCS treatment group.

Such dysfunctions are associated with anxiety, depression, and a lack of autonomy. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to enhance EF in healthy adults and clinical populations and to improve working memory - a component of the EF - in adults with high-functioning ASD (HF-ASD). We hypothesized that tDCS could improve the EF of HF-ASD patients. Such enhancement could improve their adaptive behaviors. Eight patients with HF-ASD received 10 consecutive cathodal tDCS sessions (2 mA) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (F3) for 15 min each in an open trial. EF (with the Stroop test, Trail Making Test [TMT] A and B, Modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test [mWCST], and Verbal Fluency Test) and behavioral dysexecutive syndrome (with the Behavioral Dysexecutive Syndrome Inventory and the Repetitive and Restricted Behaviour scale) were assessed before and 10 days after treatment. This study showed significant improvement in initiation (TMT-A time: p = 0.018) and cognitive flexibility (TMT-B time: p = 0.009; letter Verbal Fluency Test: p = 0.017; mWCST total errors: p = 0.028) after tDCS. Regarding behavior, the hypoactivity of the patients improved, as well as their repetitive and restrictive behaviors. In addition, this noninvasive neurostimulation technique was well tolerated. Flexibility and initiation are the most impaired EF in autism. These are promising results which justify a randomized and placebo-controlled study in a wider population. If these results were confirmed by a randomized controlled trial, tDCS could be an easy and well-tolerated adjunctive treatment aiming to improve the quality of life and the autonomy of ASD patients.","Rothärmel Maud, Moulier Virginie, Vasse Marianne, Isaac Clémence, Faerber Mathieu, Bendib Bilal, Mirea-Grivel Iris, Opolczynski Gaëlle, Rosier Antoine, Guillin Olivier",Neuropsychobiology,"Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Executive Function, Female, Humans, Male, Neuropsychological Tests, Pilot Projects, Prefrontal Cortex, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31266030,"University Department of Psychiatry, Centre Hospitalier du Rouvray, Sotteville-lès-Rouen, France.; Centre Ressource Autisme Normandie Seine Eure, Centre Hospitalier du Rouvray, Sotteville-lès-Rouen, France.; University Department of Psychiatry, Centre Hospitalier du Rouvray, Sotteville-lès-Rouen, France, maud.rotharmel@ch-lerouvray.fr.; EPS Ville Evrard, Unité de Recherche Clinique, Neuilly-sur-Marne, France."

The anode electrode was placed over right temporoparietal (CP6) and cathode over ipsilateral deltoid. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for paired data indicated that participants received a significantly higher score on the VF test after receiving verum tDCS compared to sham tDCS, with no significant differences found on the TASSK-M. Post-hoc analysis showed that the emotion-word portion of the VF test, specifically, indicated significant differences when comparing verum to sham tDCS conditions.

Such impairment may underlie core deficits in cognition and social functioning. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to enhance WM in both healthy adults and clinical populations, but its efficacy in ASD is unknown. We predicted that bifrontal tDCS would improve WM performances of adults with high-functioning autism during active stimulation compared to sham stimulation and that such enhancement would generalize to an untrained task. Twelve adults with high-functioning ASD engaged in a battery of WM tasks that included backward spatial span, backward digit span, spatial <i>n</i>-back and letter <i>n</i>-back. While engaged, 40 min of 1.5 mA bifrontal stimulation was applied over the left and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC). Using a single-blind crossover design, each participant received left anodal/right cathodal stimulation, right anodal/left cathodal stimulation, or sham stimulation, in randomized counterbalanced order on three separate days. Following tDCS, participants again engaged in letter and spatial <i>n</i>-back tasks before taking the Brief Test of Attention (BTA). We used repeated-measures ANOVA to compare overall performance on the WM battery as measured by a composite of <i>z</i>-scores for all five measures. Post hoc ANOVAs, <i>t</i> tests, Friedman's tests, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to measure the online and offline effects of tDCS and to assess performances on individual measures. Compared to sham stimulation, both left DLPFC anodal stimulation (<i>t</i><sub>11</sub> = 5.4, <i>p</i> = 0.0002) and right DLPFC anodal stimulation (<i>t</i><sub>11</sub> = 3.57, <i>p</i> = 0.004) improved overall WM performance. Left anodal stimulation (<i>t</i><sub>11</sub> = 3.9, <i>p</i> = 0.003) and right anodal stimulation (<i>t</i><sub>11</sub> = 2.7, <i>p</i> = 0.019) enhanced performances during stimulation. Enhancement transferred to an untrained task 50 min after right anodal stimulation <i>(z</i><sub>11</sub> = 2.263, <i>p</i> = 0.024).

In adults with high-functioning ASD, active bifrontal tDCS given during WM tasks appears to improve performance. TDCS benefits also transferred to an untrained task completed shortly after stimulation. These results suggest that tDCS can improve WM task performance and could reduce some core deficits of autism.

This double-blinded, randomized, sham-controlled trial included 32 participants (27 males), aged 12-17 years with autism spectrum disorder. All eligible participants were randomized into either the verum or sham transcranial pulse stimulation group, on a 1:1 ratio, based on the Childhood Autism Rating Scale screening score. Sixteen participants received six verum transcranial pulse stimulation sessions (energy level: 0.2-0.25 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>; pulse frequency: 2.5-4.0 Hz, 800 pulse/session) in 2 weeks on alternate days. The remaining 16 participants received sham transcranial pulse stimulation.

Secondary outcomes included a self-reported questionnaire responded to by parents and cognitive tests responded to by participants. A licensed mental health professional evaluated clinical global impression severity, improvement, efficacy and total score. Results revealed significant interactions in Childhood Autism Rating Scale and other secondary outcomes. Significant group and time effects were found in most secondary outcomes. Additionally, significant differences were found between the transcranial pulse stimulation and sham transcranial pulse stimulation groups in Childhood Autism Rating Scale and clinical global impression improvement and total score immediately after 2 weeks of transcranial pulse stimulation intervention (all <i>P</i> < 0.05), and effects were sustainable at 1- and 3-month follow-up, compared with baseline.

Following a series of communications from readers highlighting concerns about the paper (now published on the journal website), the journal editors requested that the authors send them the raw data from the trial. In response the authors informed the editors that; (i) the electronic data base had been lost following a computer outage and (ii) that they could send only 95 out of 120 hard-copy participant data sheets as one site had closed and was no longer contactable. The substantial data loss in and of itself posed a serious difficulty in verifying the correctness of the data presented in the paper. The JCPP then analysed the data from the 95 cases itself. A number of significant discrepancies emerged between the re-analysis and the findings reported in the paper both in terms of means and standard deviations of key outcome variables across the trial. These involved very substantial differences that we judged to be extremely unlikely to have arisen due to variations in composition of the original and re-analysed samples. We also discovered previously unidentified/reported problems with missing data and recording irregularities regarding changes in treatment regimen and subject identifiers. As a result of these issues the Editors no longer have confidence in the findings reported in the original paper. Based on all these matters combined and following published guidance from the Committee on Publishing Ethics (COPE) and Wiley's Best Practice Guidelines on Publishing Ethics, we have decided that the only course of action available to us is to retract the paper.","Saad K, Abdel-Rahman A, Elserogy Y, Al-Atram A, El-Houfey A, Othman H, Bjørklund G, Jia F, Urbina M, Abo-Elela M, Ahmad F, Abd El-Baseer A, Ahmed A, Abdel-Salam A","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31087556,

The two groups were well matched for age and sex, and none of them had received vitamin D supplementation. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were measured by HPLC-MS/MS method. The patients of the ASD group were assessed with autism behavior checklist (ABC), childhood autism rating scale (CARS), social response scale (SRS), and autism treatment evaluation checklist (ATEC). The levels of vitamin D were divided into normal(>0.03 ng/L), insufficient (0.01-0.03 ng/L) and deficient (<0.01 ng/L). Levels of serum vitamin D between the two groups were compared by two independent sample <i>t</i>-test, and the difference in the percentages of normal, insufficient and deficient levels of vitamin D was tested by chi-square test, and correlations between vitamin D levels and the total scores or subscales of ABC, CARS, SRS and ATEC were analyzed by Pearson correlation analysis. <b>Result:</b> The 87 subjects in the ASD group included 75 males and 12 females, with a mean (±SD) age of (4.7±0.7) years.

Vitamin D is metabolized into a seco-steroid hormone that regulates about 3% of the 26,000 genes in the coding human genome. It is also a neurosteroid that is active in brain development, having effects on cellular proliferation, differentiation, calcium signaling, neurotrophic and neuroprotective actions; it also appears to have an effect on neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. Children who are, or who are destined to become, autistic have lower 25(OH)D levels at 3 months of gestation, at birth and at age 8 compared to their unaffected siblings. Two open label trials found high dose vitamin D improves the core symptoms of autism in about 75% of autistic children. A few of the improvements were remarkable. The vitamin D doses used in these children were 300 IU/KG/day up to a maximum of 5000 IU/day (highest final 25(OH)D level reached was 45 ng/ml). The other study used 150,000 IU/month IM as well as 400 IU/day [highest final 25(OH)D level was 52 ng/ml]. These two open label trials were recently confirmed with a randomized controlled trial (RCT) using 300 IU/kg/day with a maximum of 5000 IU/day and resulted in effects similar to the two open label studies. In terms of prevention, a recent small study showed vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy (5000 IU/day) and during infancy and early childhood (1000 IU/day) significantly reduced the expected incidence of autism in mothers who already had one autistic child from 20% to 5%. Vitamin D is safe; for example, over the last 15 years, Poison Control reports there have been approximately 15,000 cases of vitamin D overdose. However only three of these 15,000 people developed clinical toxicity and no one died. Given those facts, practitioners might consider treating autism with 300 IU/kg/day, and seek to prevent autism by supplementing pregnant and lactating women (5000 IU/day) and infants and young children (150 IU/kg/day) checking 25(OH)D levels every 3 months. These doses will increase 25(OH)D blood levels to those recommended by the Endocrine Society. As the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends vitamin D supplementation during infancy and childhood, pediatricians and family practitioners should evaluate the current evidence on autism and vitamin D and act accordingly.",Cannell John Jacob,Reviews in endocrine & metabolic disorders,"Adult, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Dietary Supplements, Female, Humans, Infant, Infant, Newborn, Pregnancy, Pregnancy Complications, Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects, Vitamin D, Vitamin D Deficiency",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28217829,"Vitamin D Council Inc., 1411 Marsh Street, Suite 203, San Luis Obispo, CA, 93401, USA. jjcannell@vitamindcouncil.org."

It has been previously reported that there is vitamin D deficiency in autistic children; however, there is a lack of randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation in ASD children. This study is a double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (RCT) that was conducted on 109 children with ASD (85 boys and 24 girls; aged 3-10 years). The aim of this study was to assess the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the core symptoms of autism in children. ASD patients were randomized to receive vitamin D3 or placebo for 4 months. The serum levels of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25 (OH)D) were measured at the beginning and at the end of the study. The autism severity and social maturity of the children were assessed by the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), and the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC). UMIN-CTR Study Design: trial number: UMIN000020281. Supplementation of vitamin D was well tolerated by the ASD children. The daily doses used in the therapy group was 300 IU vitamin D3/kg/day, not to exceed 5,000 IU/day. The autism symptoms of the children improved significantly, following 4-month vitamin D3 supplementation, but not in the placebo group. This study demonstrates the efficacy and tolerability of high doses of vitamin D3 in children with ASD. This study is the first double-blinded RCT proving the efficacy of vitamin D3 in ASD patients. Depending on the parameters measured in the study, oral vitamin D supplementation may safely improve signs and symptoms of ASD and could be recommended for children with ASD. At this stage, this study is a single RCT with a small number of patients, and a great deal of additional wide-scale studies are needed to critically validate the efficacy of vitamin D in ASD.","Saad Khaled, Abdel-Rahman Ahmed A, Elserogy Yasser M, Al-Atram Abdulrahman A, El-Houfey Amira A, Othman Hisham A-K, Bjørklund Geir, Jia Feiyong, Urbina Mauricio A, Abo-Elela Mohamed Gamil M, Ahmad Faisal-Alkhateeb, Abd El-Baseer Khaled A, Ahmed Ahmed E, Abdel-Salam Ahmad M","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Dietary Supplements, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Vitamin D",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27868194,"Department of Clinical Pathology, Aswan University, Aswan, Egypt.; Department of Community Health Nursing, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.; Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.; Department of Psychiatry, College of Medicine, Almajmaah University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.; Council for Nutritional and Environmental Medicine, Mo i Rana, Norway.; Department of Pediatrics, Qena Faculty of Medicine, South Valley University, Qena, Egypt.; Department of Pediatric Neurology and Neurorehabilitation, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.; Department of Neuropsychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.; Department of Biosciences, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK.; Department of Pharmaceutics and Industrial Pharmacy, Alazhar University, Assiut, Egypt."

Human promoter-region microsatellite repeat regions (RS1 and RS3) in the AVPR1a gene region have been associated with autism spectrum disorders, prosocial behavior and social cognition. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle response to auditory stimuli is a largely autonomic response that resonates with social cognition in both animal models and humans. Reduced PPI has been observed in disorders including schizophrenia that are distinguished by deficits in social skills. In the current investigation association was examined between PPI and the AVPR1a RS1 and RS repeat regions and PPI in a group of 113 nonclinical subjects. Using a robust family-based strategy, association was observed between AVPR1a promoter-region repeat length, especially RS3) and PPI (30 ms: global p=0.04; 60 ms p=0.006; 120 ms p=0.008). Notably, longer RS3 alleles were associated with greater levels of prepulse inhibition. Using a short/long classification scheme for the repeat regions, significant association was also observed between all three PPI intervals (30, 60 and 120 ms) and both RS1 and RS3 polymorphisms (PBAT: FBAT-PC(2) statistic p=0.047). Tests of within-subject effects (SPSS GLM) showed significant sexxRS3 interactions at 30 ms (p=0.045) and 60 ms (p=0.01). Longer alleles, especially in male subjects, are associated with significantly higher PPI response, consistent with a role for the promoter repeat region in partially molding social behavior in both animals and humans. This is the first report in humans demonstrating a role of the AVPR1a gene in contributing to the PPI response to auditory stimuli.","Levin Raz, Heresco-Levy Uriel, Bachner-Melman Rachel, Israel Salomon, Shalev Idan, Ebstein Richard P",Psychoneuroendocrinology,"Acoustic Stimulation, Adolescent, Adult, Female, Gene Frequency, Habituation, Psychophysiologic, Humans, Male, Neural Inhibition, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Promoter Regions, Genetic, Receptors, Vasopressin, Reflex, Startle, Sex Characteristics, Young Adult",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19195791,"Neurobiology, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel."
