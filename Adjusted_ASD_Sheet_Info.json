Previous studies showed significantly less alpha activity in autism than normal children. Therefore, we studied the effects of anodal tDCS on peak alpha frequency (PAF) related to autism treatment evaluation checklist (ATEC). Twenty male children with autism were randomly assigned in a crossover design to receive a single session of both active and sham tDCS stimulation (11 mA) over F3 (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). Pre- to postsession changes in a measure of cortical activity impacted by tDCS (PAF) and ATEC were compared between groups. We also examined the associations between pre- and postsession changes in the PAF and ATEC. The results show significant pre- to postsession improvements in two domains of ATEC (social and health\/behavior domains) following active tDCS, relative to sham treatment. PAF also significantly increased at the stimulation site, and an increase in PAF was significantly associated with improvements in the two domains of ATEC impacted by tDCS. The findings suggest that a single session of anodal tDCS over the F3 may have clinical benefits in children with autism and that those benefits may be related to an increase in PAF.","1":"To evaluate the anti-spasticity effects of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in individuals with spastic cerebral palsy (CP). Forty-six children and adolescents with cerebral palsy were randomly assigned to either active (1 mA anodal) or sham (placebo) tDCS over the left primary motor cortex (Ml) on five consecutive days. Both group also received routine physical therapy. Measures of spasticity and passive range of motion (PROM) were administered before treatment, immediately after treatment, and at 24- and 48-hours follow-up. Participants assigned to active tDCS treatment evidenced significantly more pre- to immediately post-treatment reductions in spasticity than participants assigned to the sham (p = 0.004, p<O. 001l, andp = 0.004 for shoulder wrist, and fingers respectively) and these improvement in spasticity maintainedfor at least 48 hours for wrist joints (p = 0.023). There was only one participant in the active tDCS condition developed erythematous rash. However, all participants tolerated the tDCS well without any serious adverse events. Anodal tDCS appeared to reduce CP-relatedspasticity (but not PROM) in the short term. Researches examine the long term benefits of this intervention on spasticity are warranted.","2":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC), and Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) after anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in individuals with autism. Twenty patients with autism received 5 consecutive days of both sham and active tDCS stimulation (1 mA) in a randomized double-blind crossover trial over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (F3) for 20 minutes in different orders. Measures of CARS, ATEC, and CGAS were administered before treatment and at 7 days posttreatment. The result showed statistical decrease in CARS score (P < 0.001). ATEC total was decreased from 67.25 to 58 (P < 0.001). CGAS was increased at 7 days posttreatment (P = 0.042). Our study suggests that anodal tDCS over the F3 may be a useful clinical tool in autism.","3":"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has demonstrated efficacy for reducing neuropathic pain, but the respective mechanisms remain largely unknown. The current study tested the hypothesis that pain reduction with tDCS is associated with an increase in the peak frequency spectrum density in the theta-alpha range. Twenty patients with spinal cord injury and bilateral neuropathic pain received single sessions of both sham and anodal tDCS (2 mA) over the left primary motor area (M1) for 20 min. Treatment order was randomly assigned. Pre- to post-procedure changes in pain intensity and peak frequency of electroencephalogram spectral analysis were compared between treatment conditions. The active treatment condition (anodal tDCS over M1) but not sham treatment resulted in significant decreases in pain intensity. In addition, consistent with the study hypothesis, peak theta-alpha frequency (PTAF) assessed from an electrode placed over the site of stimulation increased more from pre- to post-session among participants in the active tDCS condition, relative to those in the sham tDCS condition. Moreover, we found a significant association between a decrease in pain intensity and an increase in PTAF at the stimulation site. The findings are consistent with the possibility that anodal tDCS over the left M1 may be effective, at least in part, because it results in an increase in M1 cortical excitability, perhaps due to a pain inhibitory effect of motor cortex stimulation that may influence the descending pain modulation system. Future research is needed to determine if there is a causal association between increased left anterior activity and pain reduction. The results provide new findings regarding the effects of tDCS on neuropathic pain and brain oscillation changes.","4":"Several lines of emerging data point to an imbalance between neuronal excitation and inhibition in at least a subgroup of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including in those with fragile X syndrome (FXS), one of the most common genetic syndromes within ASD. In animal models of FXS and of ASD, GABA-B agonists have improved both brain and behavioral phenotypes, including social behavior. A phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial found that the GABA-B agonist arbaclofen improved social avoidance symptoms in FXS. A pilot open-label trial of arbaclofen suggested similar benefits in ASD. We therefore evaluated arbaclofen in a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study of 150 participants, aged 5-21 years, with ASD. No difference from placebo was detected on the primary outcome measure, the parent-rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist Social Withdrawal\/Lethargy subscale. However, a specified secondary analysis found improvement on the clinician-rated Clinical Global Impression of Severity. An exploratory post hoc analysis of participants with a consistent rater across the trial revealed greater improvement in the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales II socialization domain in participants receiving arbaclofen. Affect lability (11%) and sedation (9%) were the most common adverse events. In this exploratory study, secondary analyses suggest that arbaclofen may have the potential to improve symptoms in some children with ASD, but further study will be needed to replicate and extend these initial findings.","5":"STX209 (arbaclofen), a selective GABA-B agonist, is hypothesized to modulate the balance of excitatory to inhibitory neurotransmission, and has shown preliminary evidence of benefit in fragile X syndrome. We evaluated its safety, tolerability, and efficacy in non-syndromic autism spectrum disorders, in an 8-week open-label trial enrolling 32 children and adolescents with either Autistic Disorder or Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified, and a score \u226517 on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC)-Irritability subscale. STX209 was generally well-tolerated. The most common adverse events were agitation and irritability, which typically resolved without dose changes, and were often felt to represent spontaneous variation in underlying symptoms. Improvements were observed on several outcome measures in this exploratory trial, including the ABC-Irritability (the primary endpoint) and the Lethargy\/Social Withdrawal subscales, the Social Responsiveness Scale, the CY-BOCS-PDD, and clinical global impression scales. Placebo-controlled study of STX209 is warranted.","6":"Research on animal models of fragile X syndrome suggests that STX209, a \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type B (GABA(B)) agonist, might improve neurobehavioral function in affected patients. We evaluated whether STX209 improves behavioral symptoms of fragile X syndrome in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in 63 subjects (55 male), ages 6 to 39 years, with a full mutation in the FMR1 gene (>200 CGG triplet repeats). We found no difference from placebo on the primary endpoint, the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability (ABC-I) subscale. In the other analyses specified in the protocol, improvement was seen on the visual analog scale ratings of parent-nominated problem behaviors, with positive trends on multiple global measures. Post hoc analysis with the ABC-Social Avoidance scale, a newly validated scale for the assessment of fragile X syndrome, showed a significant beneficial treatment effect in the full study population. A post hoc subgroup of 27 subjects with more severe social impairment showed improvements on the Vineland II-Socialization raw score, on the ABC-Social Avoidance scale, and on all global measures. STX209 was well tolerated, with 8% incidences of sedation and of headache as the most frequent side effects. In this exploratory study, STX209 did not show a benefit on irritability in fragile X syndrome. Nonetheless, our results suggest that GABA(B) agonists have potential to improve social function and behavior in patients with fragile X syndrome.","7":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of aripiprazole in treating irritability in pediatric patients (6-17\u2009years) with autistic disorder (AD) in Japan. In this open-label extension study, patients who had completed a previous randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 8-week study were enrolled and were flexibly dosed with aripiprazole (1-15\u2009mg\/day) until the new indication of irritability in pediatric autism spectrum disorder was approved in Japan. Seventy (81%) out of 86 enrolled patients completed week-48 assessments. The mean duration of treatment was 694.9\u2009days. The mean daily dose of aripiprazole over the treatment period was 7.2\u2009mg and the mean of the final dose was 8.5\u2009mg. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE; \u226520%) included nasopharyngitis, somnolence, influenza, and increased weight. The majority of these TEAE were mild or moderate in severity, and there were no deaths, and no clinically relevant findings in laboratory values except prolactin decrease, vital signs, height, or ECG parameters. At week 48 (observed case), the mean change from baseline in the Irritability subscale score for the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Japanese Version was -6.3 in prior placebo patients and -2.6 in prior aripiprazole patients. Aripiprazole was generally safe, well tolerated, and effective in the long-term treatment of irritability associated with AD in Japanese pediatric patients.","8":"We evaluated the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole in the treatment of irritability in children and adolescents (6-17\u00a0years) with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 8-week study in Japan. Patients received flexibly dosed aripiprazole (1-15\u00a0mg\/day) or placebo. Ninety-two patients were randomized to placebo (n\u2009=\u200945) or aripiprazole (n\u2009=\u200947). Aripiprazole produced a significant improvement in the mean parent\/caregiver-rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist Japanese Version irritability subscale score relative to placebo from week 3 through week 8. Administration of aripiprazole provided significantly greater improvement in the mean clinician-rated Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scores than placebo from week 2 through week 8. All patients randomized to aripiprazole completed the study, and no serious adverse events were reported. Three patients in placebo group discontinued. Aripiprazole was effective and generally safe and well-tolerated in the treatment of irritability associated with ASD in Japanese children and adolescents.","9":"<b><i>Introduction:<\/i><\/b> The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) is a widely accepted outcome measure for pediatric schizophrenia trials; however, it has notable limitations. Psychometric investigations have shown a multifactorial structure and some items have limited utility assessing symptom severity in children. To address these issues, we developed and evaluated optimized 10- and 20-item PANSS short-forms (PANSS10 and PANSS20) using patient-level clinical trial data. This study further assesses these optimized forms using independent clinical trial data. <b><i>Methods:<\/i><\/b> We examined patient-level data from a randomized pediatric schizophrenia trial comparing paliperidone ER to aripiprazole. Data were accessed through the Yale Open Data Access (YODA) secure platform. Analyses included confirmatory factor analyses, graded response models, \u03c9 score reliability, internal consistency, sensitivity to change, and criterion validity versus the Clinical Global Impressions of Severity (CGI-S). Bland-Altman analyses examined score calibration versus the 30-item PANSS and inclusion cut scores. <b><i>Results:<\/i><\/b> Participants (<i>N<\/i> = 288) were ages 12 to 17 years (<i>M<\/i> = 15.3, SD = 1.46; 66% male).

Average inter-item correlations were 0.10 and 0.14 and \u03c9<sup>Total<\/sup> reliabilities were 0.74 and 0.85. Both PANSS10 and PANSS20 scores showed reliability >0.80-2.3 to 4.5 SD and -3.0 to 6.0 SD about mean symptom severity, respectively. Sensitivity to treatment was also similar (partial <i>eta<\/i> squared 0.23 and 0.22), as was correlation with CGI-S at baseline (0.45 and 0.48; not significantly different). The mean item-average discrepancy with the 30-item PANSS was 0.095 for PANSS10 and 0.033 for PANSS20. <b><i>Conclusions:<\/i><\/b> The optimized PANSS forms continue to show impressive reliability, validity, and calibration compared with the 30-item PANSS. Researchers should consider replacing the 30-item PANSS with the PANSS10 as a clinical outcome and screening measure due to its length and psychometric performance.","10":"There is a paucity of studies on treatment of childhood-onset bipolar disorder and its associated comorbidities, which leads to a wide diversity of opinion on choice and sequencing of treatment options. From December 2018 to January 2019, a graphic depiction of medications and weekly ratings of symptoms of mania, depression, anxiety, attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and oppositional behavior that parents had rated on their 9-year-old child over a period of several years was sent to experts in child and adult bipolar disorder. These responding medical doctors (MDs, 8 child and 18 adult psychiatrists) rated a comprehensive list of medications that they would choose (and with what priority) to treat the child's now improved mood (mania and depression) but continued mild to moderate symptoms of anxiety, ADHD, and oppositional behavior. In the whole group, the drugs most highly endorsed were lamotrigine: 69%, lithium: 62%, lurasidone: 62%, quetiapine: 54%, aripiprazole: 46%, and valproate: 42%. Among the antidepressants, 38% endorsed a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, 12% a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and 27% bupropion. Of the child MDs, 75% suggested increasing the 1-mg dose of risperidone, while few adult MDs suggested this. Conversely, 56% of the adult MDs suggested using valproate, while only 1 child MD did so. There was little consensus on how to manage ADHD symptoms unresponsive to methylphenidate 36 mg\/d. How these treatment options were sequenced also varied widely. There was wide variation in suggestions on to how to treat persistent symptoms of anxiety, ADHD, and oppositional behavior in a child whose mania and depression had been brought under good control. We surmise that this great diversity in recommendations among experts in child and adult bipolar disorder stems at least partially from inadequate literature on treatment and that a new emphasis on funding and conducting studies on efficacy and effectiveness is needed.","11":"<b>Introduction<\/b>: The standard of treatment of pediatric bipolar disorder (BPD) often requires life-long psychopharmacological management. Several pharmacological agents are approved by the US FDA for the treatment of pediatric BPD. However, each medication may cause adverse events (AEs). Provider awareness of AE profiles of common pharmacologic agents would serve to better inform patients and families in evaluating and selecting between treatment options. <b>Areas covered<\/b>: This review focuses on medications that, in our clinical experience, are commonly prescribed for youth with BPD and were evaluated in prospective clinical trials for the treatment of pediatric BPD. This paper highlights acute and long-term AEs described in these studies. <b>Expert opinion<\/b>: Most medications increase risk of AEs in youth with BPD. Treatment with lithium may lead to thyrotropin elevations, but generally does not cause significant weight gain. Divalproex may lead to weight gain; however, this finding was not consistent in comparison studies with lithium. Olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, and asenapine are associated with metabolic abnormalities and weight gain. Studies of ziprasidone, aripiprazole and lurasidone do not suggest significant metabolic AEs. More studies are needed to assess efficacy and safety of medications in managing pediatric BPD. Special focus on long-term maintenance trials is required to further identify long-term AEs in this population.","12":"The use of atypical antipsychotic medications in pediatric patients has become more prevalent in recent years. The purpose of this review is to provide a clinically relevant update of recent selected key publications regarding the use of atypical antipsychotics in this population. Studies reviewed included randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled medication trials conducted within the past 5 years. A PubMed search was conducted for each of the 11 second-generation antipsychotic medications currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the United States: clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, paliperidone, asenapine, iloperidone, lurasidone, and cariprazine. Trials published in English with subjects 18 years of age and younger were included in this review. Additional studies, chosen for their significance to clinical practice, were also included at the discretion of the authors. This review demonstrates that more empiric data are available regarding both the acute efficacy and, to a lesser extent, the longer-term efficacy and tolerability for several of the considered antipsychotic medications. The clinical conditions for which these medications have been studied include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Tourette's disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. They have also been used as an adjunctive treatment for disruptive behavior disorders with aggression, which have not responded to treatment with stimulants. Evidence regarding the efficacy and tolerability of antipsychotic medications for mental health disorders in children and adolescents has expanded exponentially in recent years. However, more information is needed so that evidence-based comparisons between medications can be made. In the future, data enabling the selection of medications based upon individual patient characteristics could potentially lead to greater efficacy and efficiency in treating what are frequently debilitating medical conditions. Maladaptive aggression in children, often treated with antipsychotics, is one such area in which there is a dearth of actual information available to the clinician. It is to be hoped that additional, longer-term studies of these medications will further inform evidence-based practice in clinical settings.","13":"To date, no medication is proven to be effective in treating core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Psychotropic medications are widely used to target emotional and behavioural symptoms in ASD. This article reviewed evidence for pharmacotherapy, novel therapeutic agents, and Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) in children and adolescents with ASD. Currently, only risperidone and aripiprazole have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of irritability associated with ASD in children and adolescents. However, associated metabolic side-effects are concerning. Evidence supports use of methylphenidate and atomoxetine for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms and clonidine and guanfacine ER appear to be helpful. SSRIs are poorly tolerated and lack evidence in reducing restricted repetitive behaviours (RRB), anxiety, and depression. Buspirone shows promise in the treatment of RRB. The evidence is inconsistent for the effectiveness of anti-epileptic medications. Recent studies of glutamatergic, Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic, and cholinergic agents and oxytocin show inconsistent results. Despite wide use of CAM agents, the evidence is inconclusive. Melatonin can be helpful in reducing sleep problems. Overall, the evidence is limited for pharmacotherapy in children with ASD, and side-effects with long-term use can be burdensome.","14":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by impairment in social communication and restricted patterns of behavior. Although there is no pharmacological treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the core symptoms of ASD, there is mounting support in the literature for the management of behavioral symptoms associated with this developmental disorder, in particular, irritability and hyperactivity. Aripiprazole and risperidone are currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of irritability in youth with ASD. Though not FDA-approved, methylphenidate and guanfacine are effective for the management of hyperactivity in children with ASD. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are often used in clinical practice to target anxiety and compulsions; however, there is little evidence to support its use in this population. There is a great need for further research on the safety and efficacy of existing psychotropic medications in youth with ASD, as well as the development of new treatment modalities for the core and associated behavioral symptoms.","15":"To determine if acute treatment with aripiprazole (APZ) would be superior to treatment with placebo in reducing dysfunctional symptoms of elevated mood and\/or irritability in symptomatic children and adolescents at familial high risk for bipolar disorder (BPD) whose mood episodes occur spontaneously. These are patients we have previously referred to as suffering from \"cyclotaxia.\" This was single-site, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled outpatient clinical trial in which youths aged 5-17 years who met diagnostic criteria for either cyclothymic disorder (CYC) or BPD not otherwise specified (BP-NOS) were randomly assigned to receive either APZ or placebo. Eligible participants had at least one parent with BPD, another first- or second-degree relative afflicted with a mood disorder, and also had not responded to psychotherapy. Treatment with APZ was initiated at a dose of approximately 0.1\u2009mg\/kg\/day and could be increased by approximately 0.05\u2009mg\/kg\/day at each study visit. Patients were seen weekly for 4 weeks and then every other week thereafter for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was mean change from baseline on Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score. A total of 59 patients (30 APZ, 29 placebo) aged 11.8 (SD\u2009=\u20092.7) years were randomized and returned for at least one postbaseline assessment. The mean total daily doses of active APZ and placebo were 7.1\u2009mg (SD\u2009=\u20093.7) and 7.4\u2009mg (SD\u2009=\u20094.2), respectively. At the 12-week time point, APZ was superior to placebo on the primary outcome measure (p\u2009<\u20090.005). Most adverse events were mild and transient in nature. There was a significant difference in weight gain from baseline between patients who received APZ (2.3\u2009kg [SD\u2009=\u20093.3]) and those who received placebo (0.7\u2009kg [SD\u2009=\u20091.8]). This double-blind trial found that APZ was significantly more efficacious than placebo in reducing symptoms of mania in children and adolescents with cyclotaxia.","16":"Although there is no known efficacious pharmacotherapy for core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), psychotropic medications are commonly prescribed for behavioral\/emotional symptoms associated with ASD. We reviewed current evidence-based pharmacotherapy options and updates from recent noteworthy studies. Atypical antipsychotics, particularly risperidone and aripiprazole, are effective in reducing irritability, stereotypy and hyperactivity. Metabolic adverse events, including weight gain and dyslipidemia, are common. Methylphenidate is effective in reducing attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms. Atomoxetine and alpha-2 agonists appear effective in reducing ADHD symptoms. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are not effective in improving repetitive behaviors in children with ASD, and frequently cause activating adverse events. Efficacy of antiepileptic drugs is inconclusive. Overall, efficacy and tolerability of pharmacotherapy in children with ASD are less favorable than data seen in typically developing children with similar symptoms. Newer agents, including glutamatergic agents and oxytocin, appear promising albeit with mixed results. Current evidence-based pharmacotherapy options in children with ASD are very limited, and many have substantial adverse events. Clinicians should use pharmacotherapy as a part of comprehensive treatment, and judiciously weigh risks and benefits. New pharmacotherapy options for core symptoms as well as co-occurring symptoms of ASD are in urgent need.","17":"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole versus placebo in preventing relapse of irritability symptoms associated with autistic disorder in pediatric patients. This multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, relapse-prevention trial enrolled patients (6-17 years) who met the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DMS-IV-TR) criteria for autistic disorder and who also had serious behavioral problems (ie, tantrums, aggression, self-injurious behavior, or a combination of these behavioral problems) between March 2011 and June 2012. In phase 1, single-blind aripiprazole was flexibly dosed (2-15 mg\/d) for 13-26 weeks. Patients with a stable response (\u2265 25% decrease in Aberrant Behavior Checklist-irritability subscale score and a rating of \"much improved\" or \"very much improved\" on the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale) for 12 consecutive weeks were randomized into phase 2 to continue aripiprazole or switch to placebo. Treatment was continued until relapse or up to 16 weeks. The primary end point was time from randomization to relapse. Eighty-five patients were randomized in phase 2. The difference in time to relapse between aripiprazole and placebo was not statistically significant (P = .097). Kaplan-Meier relapse rates at week 16 were 35% for aripiprazole and 52% for placebo (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.57; number needed to treat [NNT] = 6). The most common adverse events during phase 1 were weight increase (25.2%), somnolence (14.8%), and vomiting (14.2%); and, during phase 2 (aripiprazole vs placebo), they were upper respiratory tract infection (10.3% vs 2.3%), constipation (5.1% vs 0%), and movement disorder (5.1% vs 0%). In this study, there was no statistically significant difference between aripiprazole and placebo in time to relapse during maintenance therapy. However, the HR and NNT suggest some patients will benefit from maintenance treatment. Patients receiving aripiprazole should be periodically reassessed to determine the continued need for treatment. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01227668.","18":"Published studies in adult and pediatric bipolar disorder have used different definitions of treatment response. This analysis aimed to compare different definitions of response in a large sample of children and adolescents. Anexploratory analysis of a 4-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled study assessed patients (n=296; ages, 10-17 years) with an acute manic\/mixed episode associated with BIPOLAR I disorder who were randomized to aripiprazole (10 or 30\u2009mg\/day) or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was mean change from baseline to week 4 in young mania rating scale (YMRS) total score. Additional assessments included: clinical global impressions-bipolar disorder (CGI-BP) Overall and mania scales, child global assessment scale (CGAS), and parent and subject general behavior inventory. Response was compared across seven operational definitions. Cohen's \u03ba and Spearman's correlation tested relationships between various response definitions or changes in outcome measures and clinically meaningful improvement (defined as a CGI-BP overall improvement score of 1 or 2). Response rates varied depending upon the operational definition, but were highest for 95% reliable change (statistical method used to determine individual change from previous assessment) and \u226533% reduction in YMRS total score. Response rate definitions with the highest validity in terms of predicting clinically meaningful improvement were: \u226550% reduction on YMRS (\u03ba=0.64), a composite definition of response (YMRS <12.5, children's depression rating scale-revised (CDRS-R) \u226440, and CGAS \u226551; \u03ba=0.59), and 95% reliable change on the CGAS or 33% reduction on YMRS (\u03ba=0.56). Parent ratings of symptoms were generally better at detecting symptom improvement than were subject ratings (\u03ba=\u223c0.4-0.5 vs. \u223c0.2 when compared with CGI-BP overall improvement score). Clinically meaningful definitions of response in acute treatment of a manic\/mixed episode in pediatric subjects include a 50% change in YMRS and a composite measure of response. Parent-reported measures of symptom improvement appear reliable for assessing symptom change.","19":"Efficacy of depression treatments, including adjunctive antipsychotic treatment, has not been explored for patients with worsening symptoms after antidepressant therapy (ADT). This post-hoc analysis utilized pooled data from 3 similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of adjunctive aripiprazole in patients with major depressive disorder with inadequate response to ADT. The studies had 2 phases: an 8-week prospective ADT phase and 6-week adjunctive (aripiprazole or placebo) treatment phase. This analysis focused on patients whose symptoms worsened during the prospective 8-week ADT phase (worsening defined as >0% increase in Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depressive Rating Scale [MADRS] Total score). During the 6-week, double-blind, adjunctive phase, response was defined as \u226550% reduction in MADRS Total score and remission as \u226550% reduction in MADRS Total score and MADRS score \u226410. Of 1065 patients who failed to achieve a response during the prospective phase, 160 exhibited worsening of symptoms (ADT-Worseners), and 905 exhibited no change\/reduction in MADRS scores (ADT-Non-worseners). Response rates for ADT-Worseners at endpoint were 36.6% (adjunctive aripiprazole) and 22.5% (placebo). Similarly, response rates at endpoint for ADT-Non-worseners were 37.5% (adjunctive aripiprazole) and 22.5% (placebo). Remission rates at endpoint for ADT-Worseners were 25.4% (adjunctive aripiprazole) and 12.4% (placebo). For ADT-Non-worseners, remission rates were 29.9% (adjunctive aripiprazole) and 17.4% (placebo). These results suggest that adjunctive aripiprazole is an effective intervention for patients whose symptoms worsen during antidepressant monotherapy. The results challenge the view that benefits of adjunctive therapy with aripiprazole are limited to partial responders to ADT.","20":"To evaluate the efficacy of adjunctive aripiprazole in patients with minimal response to prior antidepressant therapy (ADT). Pooled data from three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies assessing the efficacy of adjunctive aripiprazole to ADT in patients with major depressive disorder who had a minimal response [< 25% reduction on the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)] to an 8-week prospective ADT. During the 6-week, double-blind adjunctive phase, response was defined as at least 50% reduction in the MADRS score and remission as at least 50% reduction in MADRS score and a MADRS score \u2264 10. Rates were examined using analysis of covariance and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to calculate time to response and remission. Of 1038 patients, 72% (n=746) exhibited a minimal response to ADT (ADT minimal responder). Time to response and remission were significantly shorter for ADT minimal responders receiving aripiprazole+ADT versus adjunctive placebo+ADT. ADT minimal responders on aripiprazole+ADT showed significantly greater improvements in MADRS score at endpoint compared with minimal responders on placebo+ADT (-10.3 vs. -6.5, P<0.0001). In addition, ADT minimal responders exhibited significantly higher response rates with aripiprazole+ADT than placebo+ADT (36 vs. 19%, respectively, P<0.0001) and higher remission rates (24 vs. 12%, respectively, P<0.0001). The numbers needed to treat with aripiprazole+ADT were six for response and eight for remission. Aripiprazole augmentation had a rapid and clinically meaningful effect in ADT minimal responders.","21":"There are limited published data on the impact of treatment on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in individuals with autistic disorder. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of aripiprazole on HRQOL in the treatment of irritability in pediatric patients (aged 6-17 years) with autistic disorder. This post hoc analysis assessed data from two 8-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies that compared the efficacy of aripiprazole (fixed-dose study, 5, 10, and 15 mg\/d; flexible-dose study, 2-15 mg\/d) with placebo in the treatment of irritability associated with autistic disorder. HRQOL was assessed at baseline and week 8 using 3 Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL\u2122) scales. Clinically relevant improvement in HRQOL was determined using an accepted distribution-based criterion-1 standard error of measurement. In total, 316 patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment with aripiprazole (fixed-dose study, 166; flexible-dose study, 47) or placebo (fixed-dose study, 52; flexible-dose study, 51). Aripiprazole was associated with significantly greater improvement than placebo in PedsQL combined-scales total score (difference, 7.8; 95% CI, 3.8-11.8; P < 0.001) and in 3 PedsQL scale scores (differences [95% CI]: Emotional Functioning, 7.8 [3.4-12.2]; Social Functioning, 6.2 [0.7-11.8]; Cognitive Functioning, 9.3 [3.8-14.9]; all, P < 0.05). Patients who received aripiprazole were significantly more likely than those who received placebo to have a clinically meaningful improvement on the combined-scales total score (odds ratio [OR] = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0-3.3; P < 0.05), Emotional Functioning scale (OR = 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2-4.0; P < 0.05) and Social Functioning scale (OR = 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2-4.1; P < 0.05), and were significantly less likely to experience deterioration (OR: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.1-0.8; P < 0.05) when \"Stable\" was used as the reference group. The findings from the present post hoc analysis suggest that aripiprazole was associated with improved HRQOL, as assessed using 3 PedsQL scales, in pediatric patients with irritability associated with autistic disorder.","22":"Evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of aripiprazole in the treatment of irritability in pediatric subjects (6-17 years) with autistic disorder. A 52-week, open-label, flexibly dosed (2-15 mg\/d) study of the safety and tolerability of aripiprazole in outpatients with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of autistic disorder who either had completed 1 of 2 antecedent, 8-week randomized trials or were enrolled de novo (ie, not treated in the randomized trials). Safety and tolerability measures included incidences of adverse events, extrapyramidal symptoms, weight, metabolic measures, vital signs, and other clinical assessments. Subjects were enrolled between September 2006 and June 2009. Three hundred thirty subjects entered the treatment phase: 86 de novo, 174 prior aripiprazole, and 70 prior placebo. A total of 199 (60.3%) subjects completed 52 weeks of treatment. Adverse events were experienced by 286\/330 subjects (86.7%). Common adverse events included weight increase, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, increased appetite, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, and insomnia. Discontinuations due to adverse events occurred in 35\/330 randomized subjects (10.6%)-most commonly aggression and weight increase. One patient discontinued from the study due to a laboratory-related adverse event (moderately increased alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase). Nine subjects experienced serious adverse events-most frequently aggression. Extrapyramidal symptoms-related adverse events occurred in 48\/330 subjects (14.5%)-most commonly tremor (3.0%), psychomotor hyperactivity (2.7%), akathisia (2.4%), and dyskinesia (not tardive, 2.4%). At > 9 months' aripiprazole exposure (n = 220), mean change in body weight z score was 0.33 and body mass index z score was 0.31. The percentages of subjects with clinically significant fasting metabolic abnormalities at > 9 months were 2% for glucose, 5% for total cholesterol, 7% for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 30% for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and 5% for triglycerides. Aripiprazole was generally safe and well tolerated in the long-term treatment of irritability associated with autistic disorder in pediatric subjects. Weight should be proactively monitored during long-term treatment. clinical trials.gov Identifier: NCT00365859.","23":"To report the long-term efficacy of aripiprazole in the treatment of irritability in children and adolescents (ages 6-17 years) with autistic disorder. This was a 52-week, open-label, flexible-dose (2-15 mg\/day) study of aripiprazole for the treatment of children and adolescents with irritability associated with autistic disorder. Eligible subjects were enrolled from two 8-week randomized trials or were enrolled as de novo subjects. \"Prior aripiprazole\" subjects had received treatment with aripiprazole for 8 weeks before entering this study. Evaluation of efficacy, a secondary objective after evaluation of safety and tolerability in this study, was conducted using the caregiver-rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability subscale and the clinician-rated Clinical Global Impression-Improvement score. Three hundred thirty subjects received treatment (de novo, n = 86; prior aripiprazole, n = 174; prior placebo, n = 70) and 199 subjects (60.3%) completed 52 weeks of treatment. At their last study visit, 38.2% of subjects were receiving concomitant central nervous system medications (commonly antidepressants, 13.4%; psychostimulants, 11.5%; antiepileptics, 5.9%). At week 52 (observed cases data set), the mean change from baseline in Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability subscale scores was -8.0 in de novo subjects and -6.1 in prior placebo subjects; prior aripiprazole subjects maintained symptom improvement that was achieved with treatment in the prior study. At endpoint, the majority of subjects had a Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement score of 2 (much improved) or 1 (very much improved). Aripiprazole reduced symptoms of irritability associated with autistic disorder in pediatric subjects ages 6-17 years who were studied for up to 1 year.","24":"Effective management of major depressive disorder often includes the long-term use of multiple medications, and the longer-term utility and safety of adjunctive aripiprazole has not been evaluated in a controlled setting. Patients (n = 706) completing one of two 14-week double-blind studies of aripiprazole augmentation, as well as de novo patients (n = 296) nonresponsive to current antidepressant therapy, were enrolled in this open-label study. Patients received open-label aripiprazole for up to 52 weeks. Open-label treatment was completed by 323 patients (32.2%). At endpoint (n = 987), the mean dose of aripiprazole was 10.1 mg\/day. Common (>15% of patients) spontaneously reported adverse events were akathisia (26.2%), fatigue (18.0%), and weight gain (17.1%). The incidence of serious adverse events was 4.0%. Four spontaneous reports of possible tardive dyskinesia were submitted (0.4%); all resolved within 45 days of drug discontinuation. Mean weight change was 4.4 kg; 36.6% experienced \u22657% increase in weight from baseline (observed case analysis, n = 303). No clinically relevant changes in other metabolic parameters were seen. At the end of open-label treatment, 221 patients (69.7%) had a Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness score of 1 (not at all ill) or 2 (borderline ill). Long-term adjunctive aripiprazole therapy was well tolerated with an acceptable long-term safety and tolerability profile in patients with major depressive disorder who had not responded to treatment with one or more antidepressant therapies. Clinically significant weight gain was observed in about one-third of patients. Overall, the adverse event profile was consistent with that reported in the short-term trials and readily managed clinically.","25":"These analyses aimed to examine the pattern of improvement in depression symptoms with adjunctive aripiprazole. Data were pooled (724 subjects: n = 356 placebo, n = 368 aripiprazole) from 2 double-blind, 6-week aripiprazole studies. Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were calculated between changes on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) line items and selected Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS) line items using last observation carried forward. The magnitude of change was expressed as a between-group effect size (ES). At end point, adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated significant improvement versus antidepressant therapy alone in 8 of the 10 MADRS items (MADRS total score Cohen effect size = 0.37) and 12 of the 30 IDS items (IDS total score Cohen ES = 0.18). Analysis of correlation data identified 5 MADRS items assessing mood, lassitude, inability to feel, self-worth, and suicidal thoughts that correlated with similar IDS items; these showed a similar pattern of rapid, sustained response to adjunctive aripiprazole and a similar ES. Other symptoms associated with depression (tension associated with feeling anxious, irritability, and lack of concentration) did not show statistically significant changes on either scale at end point. The IDS identified an additional 3 important depression-related symptoms (diminished libido, view of self, and interpersonal sensitivity) that showed significant rapid and sustained improvement with adjunctive aripiprazole. This cross-correlation analysis confirmed that improvement in core depressive symptoms with adjunctive aripiprazole was identified by both clinicians and patients. Clinically, these changes were maintained during the study. Theoretically, these findings lead to important questions regarding neurochemical changes produced by aripiprazole when used in combination with antidepressants.","26":"This study evaluated the long-term tolerability and effectiveness of aripiprazole adjunctive to lithium or valproate in partial responders with bipolar mania. Completers of a 6-week double-blind comparison of adjunctive aripiprazole versus placebo in bipolar mania partially responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy could enter a 46-week extension treatment with open-label adjunctive aripiprazole plus lithium (ARI + LI) or valproate (ARI + VAL). Safety, efficacy and functioning were assessed. CN138-134LT: Study of Aripiprazole in Patients With Bipolar I Disorder; ID number: NCT00257972; registry: www.clinicaltrials.gov. In total, 283 (ARI + LI n = 108; ARI + VAL n = 175) patients entered and 146 (ARI + LI n = 55; ARI + VAL n = 91) completed the 46-week, open-label extension. Frequently reported adverse events (AEs) that occurred with ARI + LI vs. ARI + VAL were: tremor (17.0% vs. 12.1%), akathisia (6.6% vs. 8.6%), headache (6.6% vs. 4.0%), insomnia (9.4% vs. 10.3%), depression (7.5% vs. 9.2%) and weight increase (11.3% vs. 8.6%). Extrapyramidal symptom-related AEs occurred in 24 (22.6%) ARI + LI- and 38 (21.8%) ARI + VAL-treated patients, with eight discontinuations. The majority of new-onset events of akathisia and insomnia occurred early. Mean (SE) weight change from double-blind endpoint to Week 46 (LOCF) was 2.3 (0.6) kg with ARI + LI and 2.0 (0.4) kg with ARI + VAL. Significant improvements from baseline over the 52 weeks (LOCF) occurred with ARI + LI and ARI + VAL on mean (95%CI) YMRS total score (-16.5 [-18.1; -14.8] and -17.6 [-18.9; -16.3], both p < 0.001 vs. baseline) and MADRS total score (-1.7 [-3.3; -0.1], p < 0.05 vs. baseline vs. -2.7 [-4.0; -1.4], p < 0.001 vs. baseline). Over the 46-week extension, continued aripiprazole provided continued YMRS improvement with ARI + LI (-2.9) and ARI + VAL (-3.3), while mean MADRS total changes were +1.1 and +1.0, respectively, and LIFE-RIFT changes were 0.2 and -0.5, respectively. Long-term aripiprazole adjunctive to lithium\/valproate in bipolar mania was safe and well tolerated. Improvements in manic symptoms and functioning were maintained. Aripiprazole, adjunctive to either lithium or valproate, appeared to be equally safe and effective combinations for the treatment of bipolar disorder. As an open-label extension study with a low completion rate, a conservative interpretation of the findings is warranted. Additionally, the study population was not randomly selected but chosen at the discretion of the investigator, and patients did not maintain therapeutic levels of their mood stabiliser consistently.","27":"To evaluate the safety and tolerability of aripiprazole adjunctive to standard antidepressant therapy (ADT) for patients with major depressive disorder (DSM-IV-TR criteria). Data from 2 identical studies of aripiprazole augmentation (8 weeks of prospective ADT treatment followed by 6 weeks of randomized double-blind adjunctive treatment) were pooled. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and weight, electrocardiogram (ECG), and laboratory measurements were assessed during the 6-week phase, including time course, severity, resolution, and predictors. The studies were conducted from June 2004 to April 2006 and September 2004 to December 2006. The safety analysis included 737 outpatients (aripiprazole, n = 371; placebo, n = 366). The majority of patients completed the trials (aripiprazole, 86%; placebo, 88%). Common TEAEs (\u2265 5% and twice the placebo rate) with aripiprazole were akathisia (25%), restlessness (12%), insomnia (8%), fatigue (8%), blurred vision (6%), and constipation (5%). Most TEAEs were of mild to moderate severity (aripiprazole, 89%; placebo, 95%). TEAE rates in the aripiprazole and placebo groups were not affected by ADT, age, or gender. Discontinuation due to TEAEs was low (aripiprazole, 3%; placebo, 1%). Mean weight change was higher with aripiprazole versus placebo (1.73 kg vs 0.38 kg, P < .001). At endpoint, clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs, and ECG indices (including QT(c) interval) were similar between groups. Akathisia with aripiprazole generally occurred in the first 3 weeks (76%), was of mild to moderate severity (92%), and led to discontinuation in 3 patients (0.8%). Within the aripiprazole group, age (18-40 years) was the only positive predictor for akathisia. In this short-term post hoc analysis, aripiprazole as augmentation to ADT demonstrated a safety and tolerability profile similar to that in monotherapy studies in other psychiatric populations. Controlled long-term safety and efficacy data of aripiprazole as adjunctive to ADT are warranted. clinicaltrials.gov Identifiers: NCT00095823 (CN138-139) and NCT00095758 (CN138-163).","28":"This study followed manic or mixed bipolar I subjects for an additional 40 weeks after initial randomization to 12 weeks of lithium versus aripiprazole monotherapy. This is the only long-term, double-blind study comparing lithium and aripiprazole. Patients continued receiving either aripiprazole 15 or 30 mg\/day, or lithium 900, 1200 or 1500 mg\/day in a double-blind fashion for 40 weeks after completing a 12-week double-blind study (52 weeks total treatment). Efficacy endpoints included adjusted mean change from baseline to Week 52 in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score and Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total scores (observed cases). Remission was defined as YMRS total score\u226412. Safety and tolerability were also assessed. Of the 66 patients who entered the extension phase, only 20 patients (30.3%) completed the entire phase (aripiprazole n=7; lithium n=13). The significant improvement that occurred over the first 12 weeks was maintained over the 40 weeks of blinded continuation (from Week 12 through Week 52). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events in the extension phase for aripiprazole were akathisia, headache, somnolence, anxiety and nasopharyngitis (all 8%), and for lithium were insomnia (15.8%), headache (13.2%), diarrhea (13.2%) and vomiting (10.5%). Mean weight change was +2.71 kg for lithium and +5.66 kg for aripiprazole (p=0.46). This trial was not powered to statistically compare active treatments, and long-term completion rates were low in both groups. Aripiprazole monotherapy appears to be equivalently useful to lithium for the extended treatment of mixed or manic bipolar disorder patients.","29":"To investigate the specific effect of adjunctive aripiprazole on sexual function in patients with major depressive disorder and a history of an inadequate response to antidepressant medication by controlling for improvement in depressive symptoms as measured by improvement in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total scores. For this post hoc analysis, data were pooled from 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled aripiprazole augmentation studies (CN138-139: June 2004-April 2006; CN138-163: September 2004-December 2006; and CN138-165: March 2005-April 2008). Outpatients who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for a major depressive episode that had lasted \u22658 weeks with an inadequate response to prospective antidepressant treatment were randomized to adjunctive aripiprazole or placebo for 6 weeks. Sexual functioning was assessed using the Massachusetts General Hospital Sexual Functioning Inventory (MGH-SFI). To assess whether adjunctive aripiprazole improves sexual functioning directly, rather than as an indirect effect of improvement in depression symptoms, the mean change in MGH-SFI item scores and overall improvement scores was assessed using analysis of covariance, with double-blind baseline and change in MADRS total score as covariates. Correlations between MGH-SFI items and MADRS total score and prolactin levels were also assessed. The analysis included 1,092 subjects (n=737 female and n=355 male). In the total population, adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated statistically significant greater improvements versus placebo on the MGH-SFI item \"interest in sex\" (-0.34 vs -0.18, P<.05). In males, no significant treatment differences were observed. In females, improvements in sexual functioning with adjunctive aripiprazole versus placebo were found on the MGH-SFI items \"interest in sex\" (-0.41 vs -0.21, P<.05) and \"sexual satisfaction\" (-0.44 vs -0.25, P<.05). Aripiprazole adjunctive to antidepressant treatment can have some beneficial effects on sexual functioning in patients with major depressive disorder who respond inadequately to standard antidepressant treatment; the benefits in women were specific to sexual interest and satisfaction and were independent of the improvement in depressive symptoms. clinicaltrials.gov Identifiers: NCT00095823, NCT00095758, and NCT00105196.","30":"With increasing use of atypical antipsychotics among pediatric patients, detailed information about safety and tolerability is crucial. Data were pooled from two 8-week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group trials comparing aripiprazole versus placebo in subjects aged 6 to 17 years with irritability associated with DSM-IV-TR-diagnosed autistic disorder: one flexibly dosed (aripiprazole 2-15 mg\/d; target of 5, 10, or 15 mg\/d), the other fixed-dose (aripiprazole 5, 10, or 15 mg\/d). The first was conducted from June 2006-April 2008, and the second, from June 2006-June 2008. Adverse events were characterized with respect to incidence, duration, severity, timing of peak incidence of onset, and dose-response relationship. Extrapyramidal symptoms, drooling, and metabolic parameters were evaluated. Three hundred thirteen subjects comprised the safety sample (aripiprazole 212, placebo 101). Discontinuations due to adverse events with aripiprazole versus placebo were, overall, 10.4% versus 6.9%; subjects 6-12 years: 10.8% versus 5.1%; and subjects 13-17 years: 8.9% versus 13.6%. Common adverse events with aripiprazole versus placebo included sedation (20.8% vs 4.0%), fatigue (16.5% vs 2.0%), vomiting (13.7% vs 6.9%), increased appetite (12.7% vs 6.9%), somnolence (10.4% vs 4.0%), and tremor (9.9% vs 0.0%). Most adverse events were mild or moderate and occurred early. Only fatigue showed a dose-response relationship (P < .05). Mean body weight change (last observation carried forward, 1.6 vs 0.4 kg) was higher with aripiprazole than placebo (P < .001). There were no between-treatment differences in metabolic changes. The extrapyramidal symptom-related adverse event incidence with aripiprazole versus placebo was, overall, 20.8% vs 9.9%; the incidence of akathisia-related events was 3.3% vs 8.9%. Aripiprazole was generally safe and well tolerated in subjects (6-17 years) with irritability associated with autistic disorder in these 8-week studies; clinicians should be aware of this clinical profile and strategies to manage adverse events if they occur. clinicaltrials.gov Identifiers NCT00332241 and NCT00337571.","31":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of aripiprazole in the treatment of discrete symptoms of irritability associated with autistic disorder, as well as other symptoms captured on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC).

The effects of treatment on the 58 ABC items were evaluated. Statistically significantly greater improvement was seen with aripiprazole versus placebo (p < 0.05) for all arms in both trials on the ABC-Irritability total subscale score and on the following individual ABC-Irritability items: Mood changes quickly, cries\/screams inappropriately, and stamps feet\/bangs objects. Several additional items measuring tantrum-like behaviors improved in the flexibly dosed trial and at least one arm of the fixed-dose trial (p < 0.05). Measures of self-injurious behavior, which had low baseline values, demonstrated numerical, but not statistically significant, improvement in both trials. Statistically significantly greater improvement in ABC Stereotypic Behavior and Hyperactivity total subscale scores was also consistent across all arms in both trials.

This 8-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was conducted of children and adolescents (aged 6-17 years) with autistic disorder. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to flexibly dosed aripiprazole (target dosage: 5, 10, or 15 mg\/day) or placebo. Efficacy outcome measures included the Aberrant Behavior Checklist irritability subscale and the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement score (CGI-I). Safety and tolerability were also assessed. Ninety-eight patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 51) or aripiprazole (n = 47). Mean improvement in Aberrant Behavior Checklist irritability subscale score was significantly greater with aripiprazole than with placebo from week 1 through week 8. Aripiprazole demonstrated significantly greater global improvements than placebo, as assessed by the mean CGI-I score from week 1 through week 8; however, clinically significant residual symptoms may still persist for some patients. Discontinuation rates as a result of adverse events (AEs) were 10.6% for aripiprazole and 5.9% for placebo. Extrapyramidal symptom-related AE rates were 14.9% for aripiprazole and 8.0% for placebo. No serious AEs were reported. Mean weight gain was 2.0 kg on aripiprazole and 0.8 kg on placebo at week 8.

This randomized double-blind parallel-group study was conducted in three academic medical centers and a single private pediatric practice. Eighty children or adolescents (aged 6-17\u00a0yrs) with autistic disorder were enrolled, and 61 patients were randomized to the study drug. Of those patients, 51 completed the 10-week trial, and 31 completed an optional 12-week blinded extension phase. All patients were treated with 2\u00a0weeks of placebo before random assignment to receive aripiprazole (31 patients) or risperidone (30 patients) for 10\u00a0weeks. Sixteen placebo responders (20%) were excluded from further analysis. Drug dosing followed U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling, and weekly dosage adjustments were allowed until week 4; patients were then maintained on a fixed dose for 6 additional weeks. Safety, physical, and psychological assessments were recorded weekly or every 2 weeks. No significant differences in severity of illness between the aripiprazole and risperidone groups were noted at baseline. All patients significantly improved on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability subscale after 1 week and continued for the remaining 9\u00a0weeks and the extension phase. Improvement was greatest in the risperidone group at every assessment period and was statistically significantly better than that in the aripiprazole group at weeks 3 and 6 (p<0.05). No dose-limiting adverse events occurred during the dose-titration period. Mean weight gain in the aripiprazole group was significantly less than that in the risperidone group at week 4 (0.62 vs 1.38\u00a0kg, p=0.033) and week 10 (1.61 vs 3.31\u00a0kg, p<0.001), but the difference became nonsignificant for the 31 patients completing the 3-month extension phase (4.36 vs 5.55\u00a0kg, p=0.26). Pharmacotherapy of patients with autism spectrum disorder resulted in behavioral improvement within 1 week and lasted at least 22\u00a0weeks. Weight gain occurred to a greater degree with risperidone than aripiprazole initially, but the differences became nonsignificant by the end of the trial.

Primary endpoint was the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS). After 8 weeks of initial treatment, the mean total, inattention, and hyperactivity-impulsivity ADHD-RS further decreased significantly from 34.9 to 27.0 for the total ADHD-RS, from 18.3 to 14.5 for the ADHD-RS inattention subscale, and from 16.5 to 12.6 for the hyperactivity-impulsivity subscale. Adverse events were mild and tended to diminish over time during continued treatment, especially regarding nausea and fatigue. There were no serious adverse events. The results of the present analysis suggest that continued treatment with atomoxetine up to 28 weeks further improve ADHD symptoms in children and adolescents with ASD, while adverse events tend to subside.

In a 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 design, 128 children with ASD and attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were randomly assigned ATX, PT+placebo, PT+ATX, or placebo alone. PT was weekly for 10 weeks, and then monthly. ATX\/placebo was titrated over 6 weeks [\u22641.8\u2009mg\/kg\/d], and then maintained until week 10. Responders continued to week 34 or nonresponse. Placebo nonresponders had a 10-week ATX open trial; ATX nonresponders were treated clinically. All continued to week 34. With no further treatment from the study, all were invited to follow-up (FU) at 1.5 years postbaseline; 94 (73%) participated. Changes from Week 34 to FU and from baseline to FU were tested by one-way analysis of variance or chi-squared test. PT versus no PT was tested by chi-squared test, Fisher's exact test, Welch's t-test, Student's t-test, and Mann-Whitney's U test. For the whole sample, the primary outcomes (parent-rated ADHD on the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham [SNAP] scale and noncompliance on the Home Situations Questionnaire [HSQ]) deteriorated mildly from week 34 to FU, but were still substantially better than baseline (SNAP: t\u2009=\u200912.177, df\u2009=\u200993, p\u2009<\u20090.001; HSQ: t\u2009=\u20098.999, df\u2009=\u200993, p\u2009<\u20090.001).

Psychostimulant medications used to treat ADHD symptoms can exacerbate this problem. For children with ASD and ADHD, atomoxetine (ATX) is a viable alternative to psychostimulants. We investigated the effects of ATX and a manualized parent training (PT) program targeting noncompliance, on the sleep quality of children with ASD and ADHD. Participants in a randomized clinical trial were treated with ATX + PT, ATX alone, PT alone, or placebo (PBO) alone, for 10 weeks. Fifty-four of 128 (42%) caregivers completed the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) at baseline and endpoint. Analysis of covariance was used to investigate possible differences between treatment groups. There were no significant differences between treatment groups, including PBO on the CSHQ 33-Item total score, total hours of sleep per day, and total minutes awake after sleep onset at the study endpoint. ATX appears sleep neutral.

An average of seven PT sessions were conducted in the two PT arms. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed through parent ratings of common symptoms on a seven-point Likert severity scale and through direct interviews with study medical staff. ATX was associated with decreased appetite and fatigue, but was otherwise well tolerated. Most reported AEs lasted 4 weeks or less. Unlike reports with typically developing (TD) children, there were no concerns with QTc changes or suicidal ideation.

Participants originally assigned to PT continued PT during the extension; the remainder served as controls. Primary outcome measurements were the parent-rated Swanson, Nolan and Pelham ADHD scale and the Home Situations Questionnaire. Sixty percent (26 of 43) of treatment responders in the acute trial, including 68% of responders originally assigned to ATX, still met the response criteria at the end of the extension.

The Children with Hyperactivity and Autism Research Treatment Study (CHARTS) randomly assigned 128 children 5.00-14.11 years of age to four treatment groups (ATX + PT, ATX alone, PT + placebo[PBO], and PBO). Caregivers completed an 18 item questionnaire about their satisfaction with the research experience. We summarized caregiver responses with descriptive statistics and examined whether the responses were associated with demographic variables, treatment assignment, or the child's response to treatment (positive or negative). Ninety-three percent of caregivers (119) completed the questionnaire. When asked if they would join the study again if given the chance, 87% (103) responded \"yes,\" 13% (15) responded \"maybe,\" and 1% (1) responded \"no.\" When asked if they would recommend the study to other caregivers of children with similar problems, 92% (109) responded \"yes\" and 8% responded (10) \"maybe.\" Of the 59 Parent Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ) respondents who received PT, 75% (44) felt more confident in managing current child behaviors, 24% (14) felt that their level of confidence was unchanged, and 2% (1) felt less confident.

However, ADHD response to stimulants is well below rates in typically developing children, with frequent side effects. Group studies of treatments for noncompliance are rare in ASD. We examined individual and combined-effectiveness of atomoxetine (ATX) and parent training (PT) for ADHD symptoms and noncompliance. In a 3-site, 10-week, double-blind, 2 \u00d7 2 trial of ATX and PT, 128 children (ages 5-14 years) with ASD and ADHD symptoms were randomized to ATX, ATX+PT, placebo+PT, or placebo. ATX was adjusted to optimal dose (capped at 1.8 mg\/kg\/day) over 6 weeks and maintained for 4 additional weeks. Nine PT sessions were provided. Primary outcome measures were the parent-rated DSM ADHD symptoms on the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham (SNAP) scale and Home Situations Questionnaire (HSQ). On the SNAP, ATX, ATX+PT and placebo+PT were each superior to placebo (effect sizes 0.57-0.98; p values of .0005, .0004, and .025, respectively). For noncompliance, ATX and ATX+PT were superior to placebo (effect sizes 0.47-0.64; p values .03 and .0028, respectively). ATX was associated with decreased appetite but was otherwise well tolerated. Both ATX and PT resulted in significant improvement on ADHD symptoms, whereas ATX (both alone and combined with PT) was associated with significant decreases on measures of noncompliance.

Then the clinical research to date in developmental disabilities (DD), including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), is summarized and reviewed. Of the 11 relevant reports available, only two were placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials, and both focused on a single DD population (ASD). All trials but one indicated clinical improvement in ADHD symptoms with ATX, although it was difficult to judge the magnitude and validity of reported improvement in the absence of placebo controls. Effects of ATX on co-occurring behavioral and cognitive symptoms were much less consistent. Appetite decrease, nausea, and irritability were the most common adverse events reported among children with DD; clinicians should be aware that, as with stimulants, irritability appears to occur much more commonly in persons with DD than in typically developing individuals. Splitting the dose initially, starting below the recommended starting dose, and titrating slowly may prevent or ameliorate side effects. Patience is needed for the slow build-up of benefit. ATX holds promise for managing ADHD symptoms in DD, but properly controlled, randomized clinical trials of atomoxetine in intellectual disability and ASD are sorely needed. Clinicians and researchers should be vigilant for the emergence of irritability with ATX treatment. Effects of ATX on cognition in DD are virtually unstudied.","50":"High rates of placebo response are increasingly implicated in failed autism spectrum disorder (ASD) clinical trials. Despite this, there are limited investigations of placebo response in ASD. We sought to identify baseline predictors of placebo response and quantify their influence on clinical scales of interest for three harmonized randomized clinical trials of balovaptan, a V1a receptor antagonist. We employed a two-step approach to identify predictors of placebo response on the Vineland-II two-domain composite (2DC) (primary outcome and a caregiver measure) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale (secondary outcome and a clinician measure). The initial candidate predictor set of variables pertained to participant-level, site-specific, and protocol-related factors. Step 1 aimed to identify influential predictors of placebo response using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, while Step 2 quantified the influence of predictors via linear regression. Results were validated through statistical bootstrapping approaches with 500 replications of the analysis dataset. The pooled participant-level dataset included individuals with ASD aged 5 to 62 years (mean age 21 [SD 10]), among which 263 and 172 participants received placebo at Weeks 12 and 24, respectively. Although no influential predictors were identified for CGI, findings for Vineland-II 2DC are robust and informative. Decreased placebo response was predicted by higher baseline Vineland-II 2DC (i.e., more advanced adaptive function), longer trial duration, and European (vs United States) sites, while increased placebo response was predicted by commercial (vs academic) sites, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and depression. Identification of these factors may be useful in anticipating and mitigating placebo response in drug development efforts in ASD and across developmental and psychiatric conditions.","51":"There are no approved medications for the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), socialization and communication difficulties. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of balovaptan, an oral selective vasopressin 1a receptor antagonist, compared with placebo in children and adolescents with ASD.

Between November 22, 2016, and September 3, 2019, individuals were screened and randomly assigned to treatment groups. The primary efficacy analysis population comprised participants taking age-adjusted balovaptan equivalent to a 10-mg adult dose and participants from the concurrently randomized placebo group. This multicenter trial took place across 41 sites in the US. Participants were aged 5 to 17 years with diagnosed ASD and an IQ of 70 or greater. Data were analyzed from April 8 to November 16, 2020. Participants were randomly assigned to daily 4-mg or 10-mg adult-equivalent balovaptan or placebo, until the 4-mg group was discontinued. The primary end point was change from baseline on the Vineland-II two-domain composite (2DC; socialization and communication domains) score at week 24. Between November 2016 and September 2019, a total of 599 individuals were screened and 339 participants were randomly assigned to receive 4-mg balovaptan adult-equivalent dose (91 [26.8%]), 10-mg balovaptan adult-equivalent dose (126 [37.2%]), or placebo (122 [36.0%]). Primary analysis included 86 participants assigned to receive 10-mg balovaptan adult-equivalent dose and 81 assigned to receive placebo (mean [SD] age, 12.1 [3.4] years; 139 male participants [83.2%]). No statistically significant differences were observed between the balovaptan and placebo groups in change from baseline on the Vineland-II 2DC score at week 24 (difference in adjusted least-squares mean, -0.16; 90% CI, -2.56 to 2.23; P\u2009=\u2009.91). No improvements for balovaptan vs placebo were observed at week 24 for any secondary end points. Balovaptan was well tolerated with no emerging safety concerns. Similar proportions of participants reported adverse events (balovaptan, 66 of 86 [76.7%] vs placebo, 61 of 81 [75.3%]) and serious adverse events (balovaptan, 1 of 86 [1.2%] vs placebo, 4 of 81 [4.9%]). In this randomized clinical trial, balovaptan did not demonstrate efficacy in improvement of socialization and communication in this population with pediatric ASD. Balovaptan was well tolerated in children 5 years or older.

At present, there is an unmet medical need for therapies to ameliorate these core symptoms in order to improve quality of life of autistic individuals. However, several challenges are currently faced by the ASD community relating to the development of pharmacotherapies, namely in the conduct of clinical trials. Balovaptan is a V1a receptor antagonist that has been investigated to improve social communication difficulties in individuals with ASD. In this viewpoint, we draw upon our recent first-hand experiences of the balovaptan clinical development program to describe current challenges of ASD trials. The balovaptan trials were conducted in a wide age range of individuals with ASD with the added complexities associated with international trials. When summarizing all three randomized trials of balovaptan, a placebo response was observed across several outcome measures. Placebo response was predicted by greater baseline symptom severity, online recruitment of participants, and less experienced or non-academic trial sites. We also highlight challenges relating to selection of outcome measures in ASD, the impact of baseline characteristics, and the role of expectation bias in influencing trial results. Taken together, the balovaptan clinical development program has advanced our understanding of the key challenges facing ASD treatment research. The insights gained can be used to inform and improve the design of future clinical trials with the collective aim of developing efficacious therapies to support individuals with ASD.","53":null,"54":"In their article in the Journal, Sprengers et\u00a0al.<sup>1<\/sup> conclude that bumetanide does not attenuate autism spectrum disorder (ASD) despite a nominally significant treatment effect in repetitive behaviors, which is a core symptom of ASD but was defined as a secondary measure in this trial.

Here, in a proof of concept pilot study, we demonstrate that administration of bumetanide (a NKCC1 chloride importer antagonist that restores GABAergic inhibition) normalizes the level of amygdala activation during constrained eye contact with dynamic emotional face stimuli in autism. In addition, eye-tracking data reveal that bumetanide administration increases the time spent in spontaneous eye gaze during in a free-viewing mode of the same face stimuli. In keeping with clinical trials, our data support the Excitatory\/Inhibitory dysfunction hypothesis in autism, and indicate that bumetanide may improve specific aspects of social processing in autism. Future double-blind placebo controlled studies with larger cohorts of participants will help clarify the mechanisms of bumetanide action in autism.","56":null,"57":"In animal models of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the NKCC1 chloride-importer inhibitor bumetanide restores physiological (Cl<sup>-<\/sup>)<sub>i<\/sub> levels, enhances GABAergic inhibition and attenuates electrical and behavioral symptoms of ASD. In an earlier phase 2 trial; bumetanide reduced the severity of ASD in children and adolescents (3-11 years old). Here we report the results of a multicenter phase 2B study primarily to assess dose\/response and safety effects of bumetanide. Efficacy outcome measures included the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), the Social Responsive Scale (SRS) and the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Improvement scale (CGI-I). Eighty-eight patients with ASD spanning across the entire pediatric population (2-18 years old) were subdivided in four age groups and randomized to receive bumetanide (0.5, 1.0 or 2.0\u2009mg twice daily) or placebo for 3 months. The mean CARS value was significantly improved in the completers group (P: 0.015). Also, 23 treated children had more than a six-point improvement in the CARS compared with only one placebo-treated individual. Bumetanide significantly improved CGI (P: 0.0043) and the SRS score by more than 10 points (P: 0.02). The most frequent adverse events were hypokalemia, increased urine elimination, loss of appetite, dehydration and asthenia. Hypokalemia occurred mainly at the beginning of the treatment at 1.0 and 2.0\u2009mg twice-daily doses and improved gradually with oral potassium supplements. The frequency and incidence of adverse event were directly correlated with the dose of bumetanide. Therefore, bumetanide improves the core symptoms of ASD and presents a favorable benefit\/risk ratio particularly at 1.0\u2009mg twice daily.","58":"The diuretic bumetanide failed to treat acute seizures due to hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in newborn babies and was associated with hearing loss (NEMO trial, Pressler et al., 2015). On the other hand, clinical and experimental observations suggest that the diuretic might provide novel therapy for many brain disorders including Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), schizophrenia, Rett syndrome, and Parkinson disease. Here, we discuss the differences between the pathophysiology of severe recurrent seizures in the neonates and neurological and psychiatric disorders stressing the uniqueness of severe seizures in newborn in comparison to other disorders.","59":"Administration of the diuretic and NKCC1 chloride cotransporter antagonist bumetanide reduces the severity of autism spectrum disorders in children, and this effect is mediated by a reduction of the elevated intracellular chloride concentrations and a reinforcement of GABAergic inhibition (Lemonnier et al Transl Psychiatry. 2012;2:e202; Tyzio et al Science. 2014;343:675-679). Here, we report that this treatment also reduces the severity of symptoms in an adolescent with schizophrenia. Long-term treatment reduced hallucinations significantly, suggesting that this treatment may also be useful to treat schizophrenia. Further clinical trials and experimental studies are warranted to test this hypothesis.","60":"We report that the oxytocin-mediated neuroprotective \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) excitatory-inhibitory shift during delivery is abolished in the valproate and fragile X rodent models of autism. During delivery and subsequently, hippocampal neurons in these models have elevated intracellular chloride levels, increased excitatory GABA, enhanced glutamatergic activity, and elevated gamma oscillations. Maternal pretreatment with bumetanide restored in offspring control electrophysiological and behavioral phenotypes. Conversely, blocking oxytocin signaling in na\u00efve mothers produced offspring having electrophysiological and behavioral autistic-like features. Our results suggest a chronic deficient chloride regulation in these rodent models of autism and stress the importance of oxytocin-mediated GABAergic inhibition during the delivery process. Our data validate the amelioration observed with bumetanide and oxytocin and point to common pathways in a drug-induced and a genetic rodent model of autism.","61":"Sensory behaviours were not considered as core features of autism spectrum disorders until recently. However, they constitute an important part of the observed symptoms that result in social maladjustment and are currently quite difficult to treat. One promising strategy for the treatment of these behaviours is the use of bumetanide, which was previously shown to reduce the severity of autism spectrum disorders. In this study, we proposed to evaluate sensory behaviours using Dunn's Sensory Profile after 18 months of bumetanide treatment in a 10-year-old girl with Asperger syndrome. Reported improvements covered a large range of sensory behaviours, including auditory, vestibular, tactile, multisensory and oral sensory processing. Although our results were limited to a single case report, we believe that our clinical observations warrant clinical trials to test the long-term efficacy of bumetanide to manage the sensory behaviours of people with autism spectrum disorders.","62":"Clinical observations have shown that GABA-acting benzodiazepines exert paradoxical excitatory effects in autism, suggesting elevated intracellular chloride (Cl-)i and excitatory action of GABA. In a previous double-blind randomized study, we have shown that the diuretic NKCC1 chloride importer antagonist bumetanide, that decreases (Cl-)i and reinforces GABAergic inhibition, reduces the severity of autism symptoms. Here, we report results from an open-label trial pilot study in which we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychological testing to determine the effects of 10 months bumetanide treatment in adolescents and young adults with autism. We show that bumetanide treatment improves emotion recognition and enhances the activation of brain regions involved in social and emotional perception during the perception of emotional faces. The improvement of emotion processing by bumetanide reinforces the usefulness of bumetanide as a promising treatment to improve social interactions in autism.","63":"Bumetanide, a drug being studied in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may act to restore gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) function, which may be modulated by the immune system. However, the interaction between bumetanide and the immune system remains unclear. Seventy-nine children with ASD were analysed from a longitudinal sample for a 3-month treatment of bumetanide. The covariation between symptom improvements and cytokine changes was calculated and validated by sparse canonical correlation analysis. Response patterns to bumetanide were revealed by clustering analysis. Five classifiers were used to test whether including the baseline information of cytokines could improve the prediction of the response patterns using an independent test sample. An immuno-behavioural covariation was identified between symptom improvements in the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) and the cytokine changes among interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, monokine induced by gamma interferon and IFN-\u03b12. Using this covariation, three groups with distinct response patterns to bumetanide were detected, including the best (21.5%, n\u2009=\u200917; Hedge's g of improvement in CARS\u2009=\u20092.16), the least (22.8%, n\u2009=\u200918; g\u2009=\u20091.02) and the medium (55.7%, n\u2009=\u200944; g\u2009=\u20091.42) responding groups. Including the cytokine levels significantly improved the prediction of the best responding group before treatment (the best area under the curve, AUC\u2009=\u20090.832) compared with the model without the cytokine levels (95% confidence interval of the improvement in AUC was [0.287, 0.319]). Cytokine measurements can help in identifying possible responders to bumetanide in ASD children, suggesting that immune responses may interact with the mechanism of action of bumetanide to enhance the GABA function in ASD.","64":"With the current limited drug therapy for the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), we herein report a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy, safety, and potential neural mechanism of bumetanide in children with ASD aged 3-6\u00a0years old. A total of 120 children were enrolled into the study and randomly assigned to either 0.5\u00a0mg bumetanide or placebo. In the final sample, 119 children received at least one dose of bumetanide (59 children) or placebo (60 children) were included in the final analysis. The primary outcome was a reduction in the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) score, and the secondary outcomes were the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI) -Global Improvement (CGI-I) score at 3\u00a0months and the change from baseline to 3-month in the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to measure \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate neurotransmitter concentrations in the insular cortex (IC) before and after the treatment. As compared with the placebo, bumetanide treatment was significantly better in reducing the severity. No patient withdrew from the trial due to adverse events. The superiority of bumetanide to placebo in reducing insular GABA, measured using MRS, was demonstrated. The clinical improvement was associated with a decrease in insular GABA in the bumetanide group. In conclusion, this trial in a large group of young children with predominantly moderate and severe ASD demonstrated that bumetanide is safe and effective in improving the core symptoms of ASD. However, the clinical significance remains uncertain, and future multi-center clinical trials are required to replicate these findings and confirm the clinical significance using a variety of outcome measures.","65":"An important detail was omitted in the Method of the original Article, I.E, The CARS and other evaluations were conducted 'blind' to condition (Bumetanide or no treatment) by experienced clinicians.

However, clinical evidence of its efficacy in young patients with ASD is limited. This was investigated in the present clinical trial of 83 patients, randomised to the bumetanide group (bumetanide treatment, 0.5\u2009mg twice daily) or the control group (no bumetanide treatment). Primary [Children Autism Rating Scale (CARS)], secondary [Clinical Global Impressions (CGI)], and exploratory [inhibitory (\u03b3-aminobutyric acid, GABA) and excitatory (glutamate, Glx) neurotransmitter concentrations measured in the insular cortex (IC) and visual cortex (VC) by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)] outcome measures were evaluated at baseline and at the 3-month follow-up. Side effects were monitored throughout the treatment course. Compared with the control group, the bumetanide group showed significant reduction in symptom severity, as indicated by both total CARS score and number of items assigned a score\u2009\u2265\u20093. The improvement in clinical symptoms was confirmed by CGI. GABA\/Glx ratio in both the IC and VC decreased more rapidly over the 3-month period in the bumetanide group than that in the control group. This decrease in the IC was associated with the symptom improvement in the bumetanide group. Our study confirmed the clinical efficacy of bumetanide on alleviating the core symptoms of ASD in young children and it is the first demonstration that the improvement is associated with reduction in GABA\/Glx ratios. This study suggests that the GABA\/Glx ratio measured by MRS may provide a neuroimaging biomarker for assessing treatment efficacy for bumetanide.","67":"We present the secondary-analysis of neurocognitive tests in the 'Bumetanide in Autism Medication and Biomarker' (BAMBI;EUDRA-CT-2014-001560-35) study, a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled (1:1) trial testing 3-months bumetanide treatment (\u2264\u20091\u00a0mg twice-daily) in unmedicated children 7-15 years with ASD.

Preclinical studies on tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), suggest that altered chloride homeostasis may impair GABAergic inhibition and thereby E\/I-balance regulation. Correction of chloride homeostasis may thus constitute a treatment target to alleviate behavioral symptoms. Recently, we showed that bumetanide-a chloride-regulating agent-improved behavioral symptoms in the open-label study Bumetanide to Ameliorate Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Hyperexcitable Behaviors trial (BATSCH trial; Eudra-CT: 2016-002408-13). Here, we present resting-state EEG as secondary analysis of BATSCH to investigate associations between EEG measures sensitive to network-level changes in E\/I balance and clinical response to bumetanide. EEGs of 10 participants with TSC (aged 8-21 years) were available. Spectral power, long-range temporal correlations (LRTC), and functional E\/I ratio (<i>f<\/i>E\/I) in the alpha-frequency band were compared before and after 91 days of treatment. Pre-treatment measures were compared against 29 typically developing children (TDC). EEG measures were correlated with the Aberrant Behavioral Checklist-Irritability subscale (ABC-I), the Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2), and the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R). At baseline, TSC showed lower alpha-band absolute power and <i>f<\/i>E\/I than TDC. Absolute power increased through bumetanide treatment, which showed a moderate, albeit non-significant, correlation with improvement in RBS-R. Interestingly, correlations between baseline EEG measures and clinical outcomes suggest that most responsiveness might be expected in children with network characteristics around the E\/I balance point. In sum, E\/I imbalances pointing toward an inhibition-dominated network are present in TSC. We established neurophysiological effects of bumetanide although with an inconclusive relationship with clinical improvement. Nonetheless, our results further indicate that baseline network characteristics might influence treatment response.

Here, we test the effectiveness of repurposing a drug candidate, bumetanide, on irritable behavior in a cross-disorder neurodevelopmental cohort defined by the presence of sensory reactivity problems. Participants, aged 5-15 years and IQ \u2265 55, with ASD, ADHD, and\/or epilepsy and proven aberrant sensory reactivity according to deviant Sensory Profile scores were included. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to bumetanide (max 1 mg twice daily) or placebo tablets for 91 days followed by a 28-day wash-out period using permuted block design and minimization.

We observed superior bumetanide effects on EEG, reflected in increased absolute and relative alpha power and functional E\/I ratio and in decreased central frequency. Associations between EEG and clinical outcome change were restricted to subgroups with medium to high RBS-R improvement. Using machine learning, medium and high RBS-R improvement could be predicted by baseline RBS-R score and EEG measures with 80% and 92% accuracy, respectively.

Bumetanide, a selective NKCC1 chloride importer antagonist, may attenuate depolarizing GABA action, and in that way reduce disease burden. In this open-label pilot study, we tested the effect of bumetanide on a variety of neurophysiological, cognitive, and behavioral measures in children with TSC. Participants were treated with bumetanide (2dd 0.5-1.0\u2009mg) for 13\u2009weeks in an open-label trial. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability (ABC-I) subscale was chosen as the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included other behavioral questionnaires in addition to event-related potentials (ERP) and neuropsychological tests if tolerated. Additionally, the treatment effect on seizure frequency and quality of life was assessed. Endpoint data were collected at baseline, after 91\u2009days of treatment and after a 28-day wash-out period. Fifteen patients (8-21-years old) with TSC were included of which 13 patients completed the study. Treatment was well-tolerated with only expected adverse events due to the diuretic effects of bumetanide. Irritable behavior (ABC-I) showed significant improvement after treatment in 11 out of 13 patients (t(12) = 4.41, p = .001, d = .773). A favorable effect was also found for social behavior (Social Responsiveness Scale) (t(11) = 4.01, p = .002, d = .549) and hyperactive behavior (ABC-hyperactivity subscale) (t(12) = 3.65, p = .003, d = .686). Moreover, patients rated their own health-related quality of life higher after treatment. At baseline, TSC patients showed several atypical ERPs versus typically developing peers of which prepulse inhibition was significantly decreased in the TSC group. Neuropsychological measurements showed no change and bumetanide had no effect on seizure frequency. The sample size and open-label design of this pilot study warrant caution when interpreting outcome measures.

Twelve weeks of citalopram hydrobromide (10 mg\/5 mL) or placebo. The mean (SD) maximum dosage of citalopram hydrobromide was 16.5 (6.5) mg\/d by mouth (maximum, 20 mg\/d). Positive response was defined by a score of much improved or very much improved on the Clinical Global Impressions, Improvement subscale. An important secondary outcome was the score on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scales modified for pervasive developmental disorders. Adverse events were systematically elicited using the Safety Monitoring Uniform Report Form. There was no significant difference in the rate of positive response on the Clinical Global Impressions, Improvement subscale between the citalopram-treated group (32.9%) and the placebo group (34.2%) (relative risk, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.61-1.51; P > .99). There was no difference in score reduction on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scales modified for pervasive developmental disorders from baseline (mean [SD], -2.0 [3.4] points for the citalopram-treated group and -1.9 [2.5] points for the placebo group; P = .81). Citalopram use was significantly more likely to be associated with adverse events, particularly increased energy level, impulsiveness, decreased concentration, hyperactivity, stereotypy, diarrhea, insomnia, and dry skin or pruritus. Results of this trial do not support the use of citalopram for the treatment of repetitive behavior in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00086645.","82":"Autism spectrum disorders are difficult for older adolescents and young adults as impaired social communication affects the transition to adult life. d-Cycloserine, a partial glycine agonist at the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor, was tested in a double-blind randomized trial in 20 older adolescents and young adults with autism spectrum disorders using two dosing strategies (50 mg daily versus 50 mg weekly) for 8 weeks with a 2-week follow-up after discontinuation. d-Cycloserine caused statistically and clinically significant improvement with no differentiation between dosing strategies on the Social Responsiveness Scale and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist before and after d-cycloserine administration.","83":"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have core impairments in social communication as well as the presence of repetitive, stereotypic behaviors and restricted interests. Older adolescents and young adults are particularly impacted by these deficits. Preclinical data implicate glutamatergic dysfunction in the pathophysiology of ASDs. D-Cycloserine (DCS), a partial glycineB agonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor site, has been shown to improve sociability in mouse models and a small human study. The sensitivity of the obligatory glycineB co-agonist binding site may change with daily administration of DCS as a result of agonist-induced desensitization. The efficacy of a \"pulsed\" once-weekly administration versus \"daily\" administration of DCS was compared. Males and females, ages 14 to 25 years, with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition Text Revision diagnosis of an ASD were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized 10-week trial consisting of 8 weeks of active drug with either weekly or daily administration of 50 mg of DCS followed by a 2-week follow-up visit. For the purposes of this study, no statistical or clinical differences existed between the 2 dosage groups on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist subscale 3, which measures stereotypies\/repetitive movements. When combining groups, a statistically significant decrease of 37% was found from baseline to week 8 when study drug was completed using a linear mixed effects model (P = 0.003). D-Cycloserine was shown to be effective in improving stereotypic symptoms in older adolescents and young adults with ASDs measured by the Aberrant Behavior Checklist subscale 3. In addition, DCS was safe and well tolerated.","84":"To examine the effects of a digestive enzyme supplement in improving expressive language, behaviour and other symptoms in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial using crossover design over 6 months for 43 children, aged 3-8 years. Outcome measurement tools included monthly Global Behaviour Rating Scales, Additional Rating Scales of other symptoms by parents and therapists, and monthly completion of the Rescorla Language Development Survey. Compared with placebo, treatment with enzyme was not associated with clinically significant improvement in behaviour, food variety, gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep quality, engagement with therapist, or the Language Development Survey Vocabulary or Sentence Complexity Scores. A small statistically significant improvement on enzyme therapy was seen for the food variety scores. No clinically significant effect improvement of autism symptoms with enzyme use was shown with this trial, however, possible effects on improvement in food variety warrants further detailed investigation.","85":null,"86":"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has shown efficacy in resistant unipolar depression, but its efficacy in bipolar disorders has not yet been extensively investigated. Mixed episodes are reported in up to 40% of acute bipolar admissions and are associated with severe psychopathology, comorbidity, high risk of suicide and poor treatment response. Right low-frequency rTMS (LF-rTMS) as an augmentation treatment might be effective for mixed states. Forty patients were treated during a 4-week period with a mood stabilizer and subsequent rTMS (low frequency stimulation - 1Hz - applied to the right Dorso-Lateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC)) as add-on treatment for 3 weeks. Response to LF-rTMS was assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and the Clinical Global Impressions-Bipolar Version (CGIBP) subscales. ANOVA with repeated measures performed on HAM-D, YMRS and CGI-BP subscales \"change from the preceding phase\" and \"severity of illness\" showed a statistically significant time effect from the baseline to the endpoint. For the HAM-D there was a 46.6% responder rate, of which 28.6% was remitted, while for the YMRS there was a 15% responder rate, all of which was remitted. The open label-design of our study and the lack of a sham-controlled group represent a methodological limitation. The results suggest that LF-rTMS on the right DLFC might be a potential augmentation strategy in the treatment of both depressive and manic symptoms in mixed states.","87":null,"88":"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by social and language deficits and by repetitive behaviors and interests. Irritability\/aggression is a significant comorbid symptom in this population, which greatly impacts burden of care. This study examined the effect of divalproex sodium for irritability\/aggression in children and adolescents with ASD. This was a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. All efficacy measures were obtained by an independent evaluator blinded to randomization condition and side effects. A total of 55 subjects gavetheir consent and 27 were randomized in a 1 : 1 manner (mean age 9.46+\/-2.46, mean nonverbal IQ 63.3+\/-23.9). Two subjects from the active group and one subject from the placebo group discontinued the study because of either a lack of efficacy or side effects (increased irritability). Primary outcome measures were Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability subscale and Clinical Global Impression-Improvement, which focused on irritability. Overall, 62.5% of divalproex subjects vs 9% of placebo subjects were responders (CGI-irritability OR: 16.7, Fisher's exact p=0.008). A statistically significant improvement was also noted on the ABC-Irritability subscale (p=0.048). There was a trend for responders to have higher valproate blood levels compared with nonresponders. This study suggests the efficacy of divalproex for the treatment of irritability in children and adolescents with ASD. Larger sample follow-up studies are warranted.","89":"This article provides an overview of psychopharmacological treatments for repetitive behaviors in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in the context of current conceptualizations of this understudied core symptom domain. The available literature on the widely used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, and sertraline, are reviewed. In addition to SSRIs, research on effects of other pharmacologic interventions such as divalproex sodium, risperidone, and the neuropeptide oxytocin are presented. To date, data are mixed for interventions commonly prescribed in clinical practice and suggest several areas of investigation in advancing research on the medication management of repetitive behaviors.","90":"Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA) is a congenital erythroid aplasia characterized as a normochromic macrocytic anemia with a selective deficiency in red blood cell precursors in otherwise normocelullar bone marrow. DBA is known to be associated with mental retardation and learning disabilities. Although comorbidities with other psychiatric conditions have not been reported in the existing literature, we report in this paper a case of a DBA patient with previously undiagnosed comorbidity of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), successfully treated with sertaline 200 mg\/day and valproic acid 600 mg\/day. This case of comorbid presentation has clinical, therapeutic and pathophysiological implications. Given the difficulty of distinguishing among mental retardation, learning disabilities and OCD and the importance of precocious diagnosis in treating OCD especially since there are treatment methods interfering with anemia symptoms, physicians should adapt an adequate screening tool treating a child with DBA and comorbid mental disorder.","91":"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is associated with several symptoms, including impulsivity, aggression, and intense unstable affect, which can be targeted with anticonvulsant agents. Divalproex extended-release (ER) is used widely in clinical practice, which leads to the question of its efficacy and tolerability in treating BPD. This study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of divalproex ER in 20 adult outpatients with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition BPD via a 12-week open-label trial. Primary outcome measures included the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale and the Global Assessment Scale. Secondary outcome measures assessed aggression (Aggression Questionnaire, Overt Aggression Scale-Modified); affective disturbance (Affective Intensity Measure, Affective Lability Scale); dissociation (Dissociative Experiences Scale); and general psychopathology (Symptom-Checklist 90-Revised). Thirteen subjects were male and seven were female with a mean age of 37.0+\/-11.3 years. Treatment was associated with statistically significant improvement on the CGI-I, the Global Assessment Scale, the Overt Aggression Scale-Modified irritability subscale, and the Aggression Questionnaire. A trend toward significant improvement was observed on the Affective Intensity Measure. Seven out of 10 completers (70%) were treatment responders, with an endpoint CGI-I of 2 (much improved) or 1 (very much improved). There was no significant decline in affective lability or in dissociation. One participant discontinued treatment due to adverse events. These findings support that divalproex ER is an efficacious and well-tolerated pharmacologic agent for BPD, with the additional advantage of single daily dosing at bedtime. Placebo-controlled trials are needed for replication.","92":null,"93":"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairment in three core symptom domains: socialization, communication, and repetitive\/stereotyped behaviours. Other associated symptom domains are also affected including impulsivity\/aggression, self-injury, anxiety, and mood lability. Divalproex has been shown to have efficacy in treating epilepsy, bipolar disorder, mood lability, and impulsive aggression. The present study evaluated the use of divalproex in the treatment of repetitive, compulsive-like symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Thirteen individuals with ASD participated in an 8-wk, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of divalproex sodium vs. placebo. There was a significant group difference on improvement in repetitive behaviours as measured by the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (C-YBOCS) (p=0.037) and a large effect size (d=1.616). This study provides preliminary support for the use of divalproex in treating repetitive behaviours in ASD. Further research is needed to evaluate the specificity and mechanism of action of these findings.","94":"The Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale adapted for Pathological Gambling (PG-YBOCS) was developed to measure the severity and change in severity of pathological gambling symptoms. The PG-YBOCS is a 10-item clinician-administered questionnaire that measures the severity of PG over a recent time interval (usually within the past one\/two week(s)). In order to assess and validate the scale, it was administered to 337 subjects: 188 pathological gamblers and 149 healthy controls. Internal consistency and correlations between individual items and total score were assessed for various permutations of the sample. Other scales were administered to assess convergent, discriminant and content validity. Sensitivity to change was evaluated in treatment studies with fluovoxamine, lithium, and valproate. Each item was frequently endorsed across a range of severity. Good inter-rater reliability and internal consistency were obtained. The PG-YBOCS showed high validity and reliability for total score, item-total correlations, and for each subscale (Thoughts\/Urges and Behavior). PG-YBOCS scores correlated with global severity and South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) scores. The scale was also sensitive to change in pathological gambling severity. PG-YBOCS thus appears to be a reliable and valid measure of pathological gambling severity, and can be regarded as an important tool for clinicians and researchers treating pathological gamblers.","95":"The authors' goal was to determine whether specific pretreatment clinical characteristics differentially predict favorable treatment response to divalproex versus placebo for impulsive aggression in patients with borderline personality disorder. Fifty-two outpatients with DSM-IV borderline personality disorder were randomly assigned to receive divalproex (N=20) or placebo (N=32), double-blind, for 12 weeks. Trait impulsivity symptoms were determined by using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, and state aggression symptoms were determined by using the Overt Aggression Scale modified for outpatients. Affective stability was determined by using the Young Mania Rating Scale and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Analyses were performed to identify possible baseline symptom domains that predict treatment response. Divalproex was superior to placebo in reducing impulsive aggression in patients with borderline personality disorder. Divalproex-treated patients responded better than placebo-treated patients among those with higher baseline trait impulsivity symptoms and state aggression symptoms. The effects of baseline trait impulsivity and state aggression appear to be independent of one another. However, baseline affective instability did not influence differential treatment response. Both pretreatment trait impulsivity symptoms and state aggression symptoms predict a favorable response to divalproex relative to placebo for impulsive aggression in patients with borderline personality disorder.","96":"Impulsive aggressive behavior is common in psychiatric disorders and accounts for significant morbidity and mortality. However, little systematic treatment data exist from placebo-controlled trials for this symptom domain. This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which outpatients with a score of > or =15 on the Aggression scale of the Overt Aggression Scale-Modified (OAS-M) and who fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for Cluster B personality disorder (n=96), intermittent explosive disorder (n=116), or post-traumatic stress disorder (n=34) were randomized to divalproex sodium or placebo for 12 weeks duration. Based on average OAS-M Aggression scores over the last 4 weeks of treatment, a treatment effect was not observed in the intent-to-treat data set (combined across the three psychiatric disorders), but was observed in both intent-to-treat and evaluable data sets for patients with Cluster B personality disorders. In the Cluster B evaluable data set, statistically significant treatment differences favoring divalproex were also observed for component items of the OAS-M Aggression score, including verbal assault and assault against objects, as well as OAS-M Irritability score, and Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-Severity at multiple time points throughout the study. No treatment group difference was noted for overall premature discontinuation rate; however, across psychiatric diagnoses, 21 (17%) patients in the divalproex group prematurely discontinued because of an adverse event, as compared to 4 (3%) patients in the placebo group (p <0.001). While a treatment effect was not observed when all diagnostic groups were combined, in a large subgroup of patients with Cluster B disorders, divalproex was superior to placebo in the treatment of impulsive aggression, irritability, and global severity.","97":"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lithium and valproate in nonbipolar pathological gamblers. Forty-two subjects with DSM-IV-defined pathological gambling entered a 14-week single-blind trial with lithium (N = 23) or valproate (N = 19). A total of 15 subjects on lithium treatment and 16 patients on valproate treatment completed the 14-week protocol. At the end of the 14-week treatment period, both the lithium and the valproate groups showed significant (p <.01) improvement in mean score on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for pathological gambling. This improvement did not significantly differ between groups. Fourteen (60.9%) of the 23 patients taking lithium and 13 (68.4%) of the 19 patients taking valproate were responders based on a Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement score of much or very much improved. Findings from the present study suggest the efficacy of both lithium carbonate and valproate in the treatment of pathological gambling. This is the first controlled trial of the efficacy of mood stabilizers in pathological gambling. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is required to confirm these findings.","98":"Rivastigmine tartrate is a dual-action cholinesterase inhibitor shown to improve language, cognition, and global functioning in patients with Alzheimer's disease, likely via increased availability of cerebral acetylcholine. Because cholinergic receptor abnormalities can contribute to the neuropathology of autistic spectrum disorders, rivastigmine tartrate could prove to be an effective therapy for affected children. Observations of improved behavior and language output from prior open-label and double-blind treatment of autistic children with donepezil, another cholinesterase inhibitor, prompted this 12-week open-label study with rivastigmine tartrate of 32 autistic patients. Therapeutic indices were the Childhood Autistic Rating Scale, Gardner's Expressive and Receptive One-Word Picture Vocabulary tests, and the Conners' Parent Rating Scale. Testing administered at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks showed gains in both expressive speech and overall autistic behavior over baseline. These improvements were statistically significant and supported the hypothesis that treatment with cholinergic enhancing drugs in autistic spectrum disorders yields positive therapeutic effects.","99":"There has been recent interest in the use of cognitive enhancing drugs, such as cholinesterase inhibitors, as a possible treatment for executive functioning (EF) deficits in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The goal of this study was to assess the tolerability, safety, and efficacy of donepezil on EF in a sample of children and adolescents with ASD. Thirty-four children and adolescents with ASD (age range 8-17 years; IQ >75) were enrolled in a 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of donepezil (doses of 5 and 10\u2009mg), followed by a 10-week open label trial for placebo nonresponders. The effect of donepezil treatment on EF was examined. Despite improvement on a number of EF measures, no statistically significant between-group differences were found (with gains observed for both the placebo and donepezil groups). The results suggest that short-term treatment with donepezil may have limited impact on cognitive functioning in ASD. Future controlled trials may need to consider a longer treatment period to detect significant gains on EF measures.","100":"The objective of our study was to assess the efficacy and safety of donepezil in young adults with Down syndrome (DS) but no evidence of Alzheimer disease (AD). A 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a 12-week, open-label extension was conducted. The intervention consisted of donepezil (5-10 mg\/day) in young adults (aged 18-35 years) with DS, but no AD. The primary measure was the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) test and secondary measures were the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS), the Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test for Children, and the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals, Third Edition. At baseline, 123 subjects were randomly assigned treatment with donepezil or placebo. During the double-blind phase, SIB scores improved significantly from baseline in both groups, with no significant between-group differences. During the open-label phase, SIB scores in the original donepezil group remained stable; the original placebo group showed an improvement similar to that seen in the double-blind phase. VABS scores improved for donepezil, but not placebo, during the double-blind phase (observed cases, P = 0.03; last observation carried forward, P = 0.07). Post hoc responder analyses were significant for donepezil using three of five response definitions (P < or = 0.045). Adverse event rates were comparable to AD studies. In this first large-scale, multicenter trial of a pharmacological agent for DS, donepezil appears safe. Efficacy interpretation was limited for the primary measure due to apparent learning\/practice and ceiling effects. Outcomes in post hoc analyses suggested efficacy in some, but not all subjects, consistent with phenotypic variability of DS. Additional studies are required to confirm potential benefits of donepezil in this population.","101":"In light of the recently reported neuropathologic and neurochemical abnormalities of the cholinergic pathways in autism, donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor, is a potentially useful agent in the treatment of cognitive and behavioral symptoms observed in this disorder. A retrospective pilot study was conducted to determine whether donepezil is effective in the treatment of children and adolescents with autism. Eight patients (mean age = 11.0 +\/- 4.1 years; range 7-19 years) who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th edition) criteria for autistic disorder were openly treated with donepezil. All patients were on concomitant psychoactive medications. Four of these patients (50%) demonstrated significant improvement as assessed by the Aberrant Behavior Checklist and the Clinical Global Impression Scale. Decreases in the Irritability and Hyperactivity subscales were observed, but no changes in the Inappropriate Speech, Lethargy, and Stereotypies subscales were noted. Limited and transient side effects were reported, with one patient experiencing gastrointestinal disturbances and another reporting mild irritability. Double-blind, placebo-controlled investigations are needed to provide further evidence of the potential benefits of donepezil to patients with autistic disorder.","102":"Fifteen children with autism were treated with 60 mg d,l-fenfluramine (FEN) or placebo in a double-blind A-B-A protocol followed immediately by double-blind placebo-controlled crossover administration of FEN (total duration 62 weeks). Both biochemical and clinical outcomes were examined. Biochemically, FEN led to an increase in dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and decreases in whole-blood serotonin (5-HT), plasma norepinephrine (NE), and plasma 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG). The decrease in whole-blood 5-HT was seen only during treatment with FEN. However, NE levels did not return to baseline as long as 8 weeks after the first FEN treatment period. Increases in DOPAC were greater during the second FEN treatment period than the first. Persistent changes in catecholamine regulation may be related to previously reported long-term effects on central nervous system 5-HT after FEN. Clinically, FEN led to a modest decrease in parent, but not teacher, ratings of hyperactivity and to a small reduction in sensorimotor abnormalities. Abnormal social and affectual responses also decreased, but this was not directly related to FEN treatment. Effects on cognition were equivocal. Hyperserotonemic subjects did not differ from normoserotonemic subjects in clinical response. Overall, no significant advantage for the use of FEN could be established.","103":null,"104":"The authors compared the effects of fenfluramine or combined vitamin B6 and magnesium treatment on the evoked potential conditioning of 12 children whose autistic behaviour had improved clinically following treatment. The children who were clinically sensitive to combined vitamin B6 and magnesium developed a conditioning phenomenon and the fenfluramine-sensitive children showed an enhancement of the Cz evoked response amplitude. Results are discussed with reference to behaviour modifications observed during treatment.","105":"Modifications in serotonin and dopamine metabolism were evaluated in 13 children with autistic behavior and related to their responsiveness to fenfluramine treatment. A double-blind medication-placebo crossover design was used. Each patient received 1.5 mg\/kg fenfluramine daily for 3 months followed and preceded by placebo for 1 month. Clinical improvement was observed in 6 children (responders). It included reduction of behavioral symptoms such as motor activity, anxiety, mood disturbances, and distractibility. Modifications of serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and DA metabolites [homovanillic acid (HVA) and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC)] were assessed at urinary levels. Responders and nonresponders showed a significant decrease of urinary 5-HT levels on fenfluramine. The main differences between the two groups of subjects were found with HVA, the major metabolite of DA. Fenfluramine significantly increased HVA levels in responders whereas no significant modification was found in nonresponders. Moreover the initial level of HVA (lower in responders) significantly differentiated the two groups. These results suggest that the clinical response to fenfluramine could be related to the dopaminergic action of this drug and that urinary DA metabolite levels could be considered as indicators of the responsiveness to fenfluramine treatment in children with autistic behavior.","106":"Evoked potentials to auditory stimulations varying in intensity were studied in 13 children with autistic behavior treated with fenfluramine. Modifications of both amplitude and single-trial potential variability were considered according to the clinical and biochemical responsiveness to this drug. Six children (responders) were clinically improved by the treatment. Electrophysiological data were affected according to the clinical and biochemical responsiveness to fenfluramine: the auditory evoked potential amplitude increased, and the single-trial potential variability decreased at each intensity level only in responders whose dopaminergic metabolism was significantly modified by fenfluramine treatment. No modification was found in nonresponders. Both biochemical and electrophysiological results argued for an amphetamine-like action of fenfluramine in those autistic children whose attention deficits are associated with motor disturbances including hyperactivity.","107":"Body dysmorphic disorder is a challenging disorder that manifests as erroneously perceived flaws in one's physical appearance and repetitive behaviors in response to appearance concerns. This disorder is also frequently comorbid with other psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder and autism spectrum disorder. It is currently understood to arise from a combination of biological, psychological, and environmental factors. Treatment of body dysmorphic disorder typically consists of a combination of pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. However, not all patients respond to treatment, and BDD symptoms remain even in those who do respond. This review outlines current pharmacological and neuromodulation treatments for body dysmorphic disorder and suggests directions for future studies of novel treatments such as augmentation with atypical antipsychotics and the use of intranasal oxytocin in cases of body dysmorphic disorder that show residual symptomatology even with tailored monotherapy. There is emerging evidence suggesting that non-invasive neurostimulatory techniques, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, may be of value in treatment-resistant cases.","108":"The effects of fluoxetine and placebo on repetitive behaviors and global severity were compared in adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Adults with ASDs were enrolled in a 12-week double-blind placebo-controlled fluoxetine trial. Thirty-seven were randomly assigned to fluoxetine (N=22) or placebo (N=15). Dosage followed a fixed schedule, starting at 10 mg\/day and increasing as tolerated up to 80 mg\/day. Repetitive behaviors were measured with the compulsion subscale of the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale; the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) improvement scale was used to rate improvement in obsessive-compulsive symptoms and overall severity. There was a significant treatment-by-time interaction indicating a significantly greater reduction in repetitive behaviors across time for fluoxetine than for placebo. With overall response defined as a CGI global improvement score of 2 or less, there were significantly more responders at week 12 in the fluoxetine group than in the placebo group. The risk ratio was 1.5 for CGI global improvement (responders: fluoxetine, 35%; placebo, 0%) and 1.8 for CGI-rated improvement in obsessive-compulsive symptoms (responders: fluoxetine, 50%; placebo, 8%). Only mild and moderate side effects were observed. Fluoxetine treatment, compared to placebo, resulted in significantly greater improvement in repetitive behaviors, according to both the Yale-Brown compulsion subscale and CGI rating of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, as well as on the CGI overall improvement rating. Fluoxetine appeared to be well tolerated. These findings stand in contrast to findings in a trial of citalopram for childhood autism.","109":"Awareness of the impact and prevalence of autism spectrum disorders has significantly increased in recent years. Given the dearth of reliable interventions, there is great interest in demonstrating efficacy of the various treatment options. A growing body of evidence links autism spectrum disorders to abnormalities in serotonin function, and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been utilized to target various symptoms of the disorders. This article reviews the available data on the efficacy and tolerability of SSRIs in individuals with autism spectrum disorders. Objectives for future research in this area will also be suggested. The entire PubMed database including MEDLINE (1966-July 2005) was searched for English-language biomedical articles. Search terms included autism, autism spectrum disorder, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, pervasive developmental disorder, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and sertraline. All clinical trials evaluating treatment outcomes associated with the use of SSRIs in managing symptoms of autism that were identified in the search were reviewed. All randomized controlled trials and open-label trials were included in this review. Case reports and case series were excluded. We identified 3 randomized controlled trials and 10 open-label trials or retrospective chart reviews on the use of SSRIs in autism and autism spectrum disorders. The SSRIs that have been studied in autism spectrum disorders are citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline. Most studies demonstrate significant improvement in global functioning and in symptoms associated with anxiety and repetitive behaviors. While side effects were generally considered to be mild, increased activation and agitation occurred in some subjects. Although SSRIs may demonstrate therapeutic benefit in autism spectrum disorders, methodological weaknesses of many of the clinical trials suggest the need for additional randomized controlled trials. Furthermore, given the increased awareness of the dangers associated with SSRI-induced activation and agitation, the presence of these side effects in the autistic population warrants closer attention to dosage, titration, and subject selection issues.","110":"Repetitive behaviors are a core symptom domain in autism that has been linked to alterations in the serotonin system. While the selective serotonin-receptive inhibitor fluvoxamine has been shown to be effective in adults with autism, as yet no published placebo controlled trials with these agents document safety and efficacy in children with autism. This study examines the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor liquid fluoxetine in the treatment of repetitive behaviors in childhood and adolescent autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). In total, 45 child or adolescent patients with ASD were randomized into two acute 8-week phases in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study of liquid fluoxetine. Study design included two randomized 8-week fluoxetine and placebo phases separated by a 4-week washout phase. Outcome measures included measures of repetitive behaviors and global improvement. Low-dose liquid fluoxetine (mean final dose: 9.9+\/-4.35 mg\/day) was superior to placebo in the treatment of repetitive behaviors by CY-BOCS compulsion scale. The effect size was in the moderate to large range, and the doses used were low. Liquid fluoxetine was only slightly, and not significantly, superior to placebo on CGI autism score partially due to a phase order effect. However, fluoxetine was marginally superior to placebo on a composite measure of global effectiveness. Liquid fluoxetine did not significantly differ from placebo on treatment emergent side effects. Liquid fluoxetine in low doses is more effective than placebo in the treatment of repetitive behaviors in childhood autism. Limitations include small sample size and the crossover design of the study. Further replication and long-term maintenance trials are needed.","111":"There are specific challenges to studying the design of pharmacologic trials in child\/adolescent and adult autism, such as subject stratification and parallel versus crossover designs. This article describes how optimal study design is influenced by subject selection and outcome measures chosen. Lessons learned in study design from the Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology Autism Network trial with risperidone, Seaver Center trials with fluoxetine and valproate, Dartmouth trials with amantadine, and National Institutes of Health secretin trials are highlighted. The Internet System for Assessing Autistic Children system for managing multicenter clinical trials in autism and statistical issues in autism research are also described.","112":"What are the latest psychotherapeutic and pharmacotherapeutic treatment recommendations for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)? OCD is a relatively common disorder with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 2% in the general population. It often has an early onset, usually in childhood or adolescence, and frequently becomes chronic and disabling if left untreated. High associated healthcare utilization and costs, and reduced productivity resulting in loss of earning, pose a huge economic burden to OCD patients and their families, employers, and society. OCD is characterized by the presence of obsessions and compulsions that are time-consuming, cause marked distress, or significantly interfere with a person's functioning. Most patients with OCD experience symptoms throughout their lives and benefit from long-term treatment. Both psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are recommended, either alone or in combination, for the treatment of OCD. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is the psychotherapy of choice. Pharmacologic treatment options include the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline. These have all shown benefit in acute treatment trials; clomipramine, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, and sertraline have also demonstrated benefit in long-term treatment trials (at least 24 weeks), and clomipramine, sertraline, and fluvoxamine have United States Food and Drug Administration approvals for use in children and adolescents. Available treatment guidelines recommend first-line use of an SSRI (ie, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, or citalopram) in preference to clomipramine, due to the latter's less favorable adverse-event profile. Further, pharmacotherapy for a minimum of 1-2 years is recommended before very gradual withdrawal may be considered.","113":"Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a chronic and often disabling disorder that affects 2 to 3 percent of the U.S. population. Optimal treatment involves a combination of pharmacologic and cognitive-behavioral therapies. Advances in psychopharmacology have led to safe and effective treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder that provide clinically significant improvement in symptoms. In this article the authors review studies of pharmacologic treatments. A MEDLINE search was conducted to identify relevant articles from 1991 to 2002. Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies as well as open-label studies and case reports were included. The serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs), including clomipramine, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine, have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder; three of these (clomipramine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline) have been approved for treatment of children and adolescents. Clomipramine and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are first-line agents. However, 40 to 60 percent of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder do not respond to adequate treatment trials with SRIs, and agents that alter serotonin receptors and other neurotransmitter systems, such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and second-messenger systems, may play a role in treatment. Treatment options for patients who do not respond to SRIs include switching, augmentation, or novel-agent strategies. Up to two-thirds of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder have comorbid psychiatric disorders, which may present a challenge in pharmacologic treatment. Major depressive disorder is the most common comorbid condition. Nonpharmacologic invasive techniques may play a role in refractory cases of obsessive-compulsive disorder, but further research is warranted.","114":"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are often comorbid and have both performance and brain dysfunctions during motor response inhibition. Serotonin agonists modulate motor response inhibition and have shown positive behavioural effects in both disorders. We therefore used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the so far unknown shared and disorder-specific inhibitory brain dysfunctions in these two disorders, as well as the effects of a single dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. Age-matched boys with ADHD (18), ASD (19) and healthy controls (25) were compared with fMRI during a stop task measuring motor inhibition. Patients were scanned twice, under either an acute dose of fluoxetine or placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised design. Repeated measures analyses within patients assessed drug effects. To test for potential normalisation effects of brain dysfunctions, patients under each drug condition were compared to controls. Under placebo, relative to controls, ASD boys showed overactivation in left and right inferior frontal cortex (IFC), while ADHD boys showed disorder-specific underactivation in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and basal ganglia. Under fluoxetine, the prefrontal dysfunctions were no longer observed, due to inverse effects of fluoxetine on these activations: fluoxetine downregulated IFC and OFC activation in ASD but upregulated them in ADHD. The findings show that fluoxetine normalises frontal lobe dysfunctions in both disorders via inverse effects, downregulating abnormally increased frontal activation in ASD and upregulating abnormally decreased frontal activation in ADHD, potentially reflecting inverse baseline serotonin levels in both disorders.","115":"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) share brain function abnormalities during cognitive flexibility. Serotonin is involved in both disorders, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can modulate cognitive flexibility and improve behavior in both disorders. Thus, this study investigates shared and disorder-specific brain dysfunctions in these 2 disorders during reward reversal, and the acute effects of an SSRI on these. Age-matched boys with ADHD (15), ASD (18), and controls (21) were compared with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a reversal task. Patients were scanned twice, under either an acute dose of Fluoxetine or placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized design. Repeated-measures analyses within patients assessed drug effects. Patients under each drug condition were compared with controls to assess normalization effects. fMRI data showed that, under placebo, ASD boys underactivated medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), compared with control and ADHD boys. Both patient groups shared decreased precuneus activation. Under Fluoxetine, mPFC activation was up-regulated and normalized in ASD boys relative to controls, but down-regulated in ADHD boys relative to placebo, which was concomitant with worse task performance in ADHD. Fluoxetine therefore has inverse effects on mPFC activation in ASD and ADHD during reversal learning, suggesting dissociated underlying serotonin abnormalities.","116":"Selective serotonin receptor inhibitors are prescribed to reduce the severity of core behaviors of autism spectrum disorders, but their efficacy remains uncertain. To determine the efficacy of fluoxetine for reducing the frequency and severity of obsessive-compulsive behaviors in autism spectrum disorders. Multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Participants aged 7.5-18 years with autism spectrum disorders and a total score of 6 or higher on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, modified for pervasive developmental disorder (CYBOCS-PDD) were recruited from 3 tertiary health centers across Australia. Enrollment began November 2010 and ended April 2017. Follow-up ended August 2017. Participants were randomized to receive fluoxetine (n\u2009=\u200975) or placebo (n\u2009=\u200971). Study medication was commenced at 4 or 8 mg\/d for the first week, depending on weight, and then titrated to a maximum dose of 20 or 30 mg\/d over 4 weeks. Treatment duration was 16 weeks. The primary outcome was the total score on the CYBOCS-PDD (scores range from 0-20; higher scores indicate higher levels of maladaptive behaviors; minimal clinically important difference, 2 points) at 16 weeks postrandomization, analyzed with a linear regression model adjusted for stratification factors (site, age at baseline, and intellectual disability), with an additional prespecified model that included additional adjustment for baseline score, sex, communication level, and imbalanced baseline and demographic variables. Among the 146 participants who were randomized (85% males; mean age, 11.2 years), 109 completed the trial; 31 in the fluoxetine group and 21 in the placebo group dropped out or did not complete treatment. The mean CYBOCS-PDD score from baseline to 16 weeks decreased in the fluoxetine group from 12.80 to 9.02 points (3.72-point decrease; 95% CI, -4.85 to -2.60) and in the placebo group from 13.13 to 10.89 points (2.53-point decrease; 95% CI, -3.86 to -1.19). The between-group mean difference at 16 weeks was -2.01 (95% CI, -3.77 to -0.25; P\u2009=\u2009.03) (adjusted for stratification factors), and in the prespecified model with further adjustment, it was -1.17 (95% CI, -3.01 to 0.67; P\u2009=\u2009.21). In this preliminary study of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders, treatment with fluoxetine compared with placebo resulted in significantly lower scores for obsessive-compulsive behaviors at 16 weeks. Interpretation is limited by the high dropout rate, null findings of prespecified analyses that accounted for potentially confounding factors and baseline imbalances, and CIs for the treatment effect that included the minimal clinically important difference. anzctr.org.au Identifier: ACTRN12608000173392.","117":"This paper reviews the published literature on the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for the treatment of symptoms associated with autistic disorder and other pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs) in both children and adults. To date, placebocontrolled studies of SSRIs have involved only fluvoxamine (in children and adults) and fluoxetine (in children). Open-label and retrospective studies of all other SSRIs in PDDs have also been published that suggest effectiveness. Despite these positive reports, there continues to be questions about the tolerability and appropriate dosing of SSRIs in children with PDDs. Because of the limited number of placebo-controlled studies, definitive conclusions about the role SSRIs should play in the clinical treatment of children with PDDs cannot be drawn. Larger, placebo-controlled studies of SSRIs are needed to guide clinical treatment.","118":"We studied the correlation between response to fluvoxamine and serotonin transporter gene promoter region polymorphism (5-HTTLPR). Eighteen children with autistic disorder completed a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover study of fluvoxamine. Behavioral assessments were obtained before and at 12 weeks of treatment. 5-HTTLPR (long (l) or short(s)), was analyzed by the PCR method. Ten out of 18 patients responded to fluvoxamine treatment; allele type analysis revealed that clinical global effectiveness was noted significantly more in the l allele than in the s allele. However, with respect to language use, a significant effectiveness was noted in the s allele. 5-HTTLPR may influence the individual responses to fluvoxamine administration.","119":"Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have recently been applied to the children with autistic disorder. To create better treatment, we studied here clinical adverse effects of fluvoxamine and correlated them with genetic polymorphism of two genes, the promoter region of serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) and serotonin 2A receptor gene (5-HT2AR). Twenty-eight subjects, consisting of 23 boys and 5 girls, aged from 3 to 18 years old diagnosed as having autistic disorder were analyzed during fluvoxamine administration. The dosages and duration of fluvoxamine treatment are 1.5 to 3 mg\/kg\/day and 2 weeks to 17 months (mean 7.9 months), respectively. There were several clinical adverse effects such as sleep disturbance in 9 cases, climb up to high places in 8, gastrointestinal symptoms in 6, hyperactivities in 5, excitement in 4, general fatigability in 2 and urticaria in 1. Medication was discontinued in 2 patients with fatigability and 1 with sleep disturbance, diarrhea and poor appetite. There was no significant correlation between genetic polymorphism in 5-HTTLPR and the occurrence of clinical adverse effects of fluvoxamine. However hyperactivity was significantly more frequent in the subjects with 102T\/102T polymorphism of 5-HT2AR, and patients with sleep disturbance were significantly less frequent in the subjects with 102C\/102C polymorphism. We conclude that the clinical adverse effects such as climb up to high places and hyperactivity during fluvoxamine treatment may be relatively specific in children, and that genetic polymorphism of 5-HT2AR may be related to the appearance of clinical adverse effects.","120":"Fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor which modulates serotoninergic activities, is a useful drug for patients with an autistic disorder. Genetic variation of the serotonin receptor may influence the efficacy of fluvoxamine treatment. We studied the correlation between clinical responses to fluvoxamine and serotonin receptor gene polymorphism (5-HT2AR) in children with an autistic disorder. Eighteen patients completed a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover study. Clinical global impression (CGI) by child neurologists and interviews for parents were assessed after 12 weeks of fluvoxamine treatment. Behavioral assessments consisting of 20 items by newly created Behavioral Assessment Scale (BAS) were obtained before as well as 6 and 12 weeks after treatment. For genotyping of 5-HT2AR, 102 T\/C polymorphism was analyzed by the PCR method. Seven cases of T\/T, 6 of T\/C and 5 of C\/C were identified. The patients with the genotype T\/C responded more favorably when estimated by CGI and parents' report at 12 weeks of treatment. Although not significant statistically (p = 0.0578), the number of improved BAS items in these patients were larger after fluvoxamine than placebo treatment. On analyses of individual BAS items, the patients with the genotype C\/C showed improvement of unnatural facial expression, which was significant at 6 weeks, but not at 12 weeks, of fluvoxamine treatment. In the patients with the genotype T\/C, eye movements and emotional changes were significantly improved at 12 weeks of treatment. Our results suggested that genetic polymorphism of 102 T\/C in the 5-HT2AR gene may have influence on the response to fluvoxamine treatment for patients with an autistic disorder. Because of the small numbers of subject studied here, further studies are needed. The methods of fluvoxamine treatment, such as appropriate dosage and treatment duration, should also be clarified.","121":"To observe the clinical efficacy of dopamine modulator methylphenidate (MPH) of extended-release formulations (MPH-ER) augmentation of ongoing fluvoxamine treatment in refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and its effects on patient's anxiety and sleep quality.\u2029 Methods: A pilot randomized, placebo-controlled, and double-blind trial was conducted at an outpatient, single-center academic setting. Participants included 44 adults with serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment-refractory OCD and they received a stable fluvoxamine pharmacotherapy with Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores higher than 20. The 44 patients were randomly assigned into a study group and a control group, with 22 patiencs in each group. Fluvoxamine and MPH-ER were given to the study group, while fluvoxamine and placebo were given to the control group, with 8 weeks of the treatment course. Y-BOCS, Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) were used to assess the efficacy, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to evaluate the sleep quality, and Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS) was used to evaluate the side effects. Data were analyzed in the intention-to-treat sample.\u2029 Results: The improvement in the Y-BOCS total score, Y-BOCS obsession subscale score and HAMA score were more prominent in the study group than those in the control group (P<0.001). There was no significant difference in PSQI score and TESS score between the two groups. MPH-ER was well tolerated.\u2029 Conclusion: Fluvoxamine combined with MPH-ER is effective in the treatment of refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder. It can improve anxiety and has no adverse effect on sleep quality.","122":"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the treatment of premature ejaculation (PE). From MEDLINE (Jan, 1950-Mar, 2008), EMBASE (Jan, 1980-Mar, 2008), The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2008) and CNKI (Jan, 1979-Mar, 2008), we retrieved and screened the randomized controlled trials (RCT) and randomized crossover trials (RT) as well as various related data, published and unpublished, on the treatment of PE with SSRIs. The methodological quality of the included trials was evaluated by 2 reviewers. Meta-analyses were conducted with RevMan 5.0 on the homogeneous studies. Totally 22 studies on 4 291 patients were included. Meta-analyses showed that after treated with sertraline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, citalopram, dapoxetine and fluvoxamine, the WMD (95% CI) values of the changes in intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) were 2.63 (1.80, 3.46), 2.21 (1.50, 2.92), 4.31 (2.71, 5.91), 3.82 (3.39, 4.25), 1.57 (1.31, 1.84) and 0.01 (0.71, 0.73) respectively; the RR (95% CI) values of the sexual satisfaction rate of the patients were 1.65 (1.12, 2.43), 2.93 (0.50, 17.31), 3.08 (2.27, 4.17), 2.48 (1.99, 3.09) and 2.93 (2.36, 3.65), and those of their partners were 1.47 (0.98, 2.21), 2.88 (0.38, 21.77), 4.81 (3.15, 7.36), 5.38 (3.75, 7.72) and 2.91 (1.09, 7.78) respectively for sertraline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, citalopram and dapoxetine. All the known SSRIs but fluvoxamine could prolong IELT, and some could improve the sexual satisfaction of both the patients and their partners, but their adverse effects should be noted. The moderate possibility of selection bias and publication bias in the included studies might have a negative impact on the evidence intensity of our results. We expect more reliable evidence from more randomized controlled trials.","123":"A selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor, fluvoxamine (10 and 30 mg\/kg, i.p.) suppressed long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal CA1 field of anesthetized rats. Fluvoxamine (30 mg\/kg, i.p.)-induced suppression of LTP was completely reversed by the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist NAN-190 (0.5 mg\/kg, i.p), but not by the 5-HT(4) receptor antagonist GR 113808 (20 microg\/rat, i.c.v.) and the 5-HT(7) receptor antagonist DR 4004 (10 microg\/rat, i.c.v.). These data suggest that the inhibitory effect of fluvoxamine on LTP induction is mediated via 5-HT(1A) receptors.","124":"The characteristics of endogenous serotonin (5-HT)-mediated synaptic transmission were investigated in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 fields of anaesthetized rats. Electrophysiological approaches were used to elucidate the effects of a selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor, fluvoxamine, on synaptic transmission by determining the population spike amplitude (PSA). Fluvoxamine (10 or 30 mg\/kg i.p.) increased the PSA in the CA1 and CA3 fields concentration dependently, whereby this facilitatory response was greater in the CA3 than in the CA1 field. Fluvoxamine (30 mg\/kg i.p.)-induced increases in the PSA were augmented by the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist NAN 190 (0.5 mg\/kg i.p.) and prevented by the 5-HT(4) receptor antagonist GR 113808 (20 micro g\/rat i.c.v.) or by the 5-HT(7) receptor antagonist DR 4004 (10 micro g\/rat i.c.v.) in the CA1 field. Thus, fluvoxamine-induced facilitatory effects appear to be mediated via 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(4)\/5-HT(7) receptors in an inhibitory and a stimulatory manner, respectively. In the CA3 field, excitability produced by fluvoxamine was abolished by either NAN 190 or DR 4004, but not by GR 113808, suggesting that 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(7) receptors contribute to this facilitation. These findings were supported in part by the results obtained by exogenously applied 5-HT receptor agonists: the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist tandospirone (10 mg\/kg i.p.) decreased PSA in the CA1 field, whereas the 5-HT(4) receptor agonist SC 53116 (10 micro g\/rat i.c.v.) increased it. In contrast, in the CA3 field, tandospirone increased PSA, whereas SC 53116 had no effect. Taken together, the present study revealed that characteristics of synaptic transmission mediated via 5-HT receptors differ between the CA1 and CA3 fields: in the CA1 field, three 5-HT receptors, 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(4) and 5-HT(7), are associated with the endogenous 5-HT-induced facilitation in an opposite and independent manner. In the CA3 field, at least two 5-HT receptors, i.e. 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(7), are involved in this mediation in a facilitatory manner. 5-HT neurons may modulate pyramidal neuron responses to incoming stimuli by complex mechanisms involving these 5-HT receptors. In other words, the net effects resulting from the differential characteristics in the CA1 and CA3 fields may play an important role in the physiological functions of the hippocampus.","125":"Effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) on neurons of the rat dorsolateral septal nucleus (DLSN) were examined by intracellular and whole-cell patch-clamp recording techniques. An outward current was induced by 5-HT (1-100 microM) in a concentration-dependent manner. The EC(50) for 5-HT was 4.8 microM. Also, 8-OH-DPAT (10-100 microM) produced the outward current an EC(50) of 17 microM. Amplitudes of the outward currents produced by 5-HT (100 microM) and 8-OH-DPAT (100 microM) were 117+\/-4 (n=6) and 58+\/-8 pA (n=6), respectively. Fluvoxamine (200 nM), a specific serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, enhanced the 5-HT (1 microM)-induced outward current: the EC(50) for 5-HT was 0.5 microM in the presence of fluvoxamine (200 nM). L-694247 (100 microM) and CP 93129 (100 microM) also produced outward currents with amplitudes of 33+\/-3 (n=4) and 18+\/-5 pA (n=4), respectively in DLSN neurons. DOI (100 microM) and RS 67333 (100 microM) did not produce outward currents. NAN-190 shifted, in a parallel manner, the concentration-response relationship of 5-HT to the right. The Lineweaver-Burk plot of the concentration-response curve showed that NAN-190 depressed the 5-HT-induced current in a competitive manner. The current-voltage relationship indicates that the 5-HT-induced current reversed polarity at a potential close to the equilibrium potential of K(+). Ba(2+) (100 microM-1 mM) partially depressed the outward current produced by 5-HT. These results suggest that 5-HT induces multiple K(+) currents via 5-HT(1A) receptors in DLSN neurons.","126":"Twelve pigeons were successfully (ED50 = 2.4 mg\/kg p.o.) trained to discriminate the 5-HT(1A\/B) receptor agonist eltoprazine (5.0 mg\/kg p.o.) from its vehicle in a fixed-ratio (FR)30 two-key operant drug discrimination procedure. Tests for generalization and antagonism showed that 5-HT1A receptor agonists, such as 8-OH-DPAT (8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin) (66.7%), flesinoxan (72.7%), buspirone (58.3%), and ipsapirone (36.4%) only partially substituted for the eltoprazine cue. Compounds with mixed agonistic action at 5-HT1 receptors, completely (> or = 80%) [(eltoprazine; TFMPP (1-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl) piperazine (ED50 = 7.68 mg\/kg) and RU 24969 (5-methoxy-3-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl-1H-indole) (ED50 = 15.8 mg\/kg)] substituted for eltoprazine; whereas m-CPP (1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine) did not. The selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine partially (44%) substituted for the eltoprazine cue. The 5-HT1A receptor antagonist NAN-190 (1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phtalimido)butyl]piperazine) fully blocked the eltoprazine cue. Both (+\/-)-pindolol and (+\/-)-propranolol showed partial antagonism of the eltoprazine cue (66.7 and 50.0%, respectively). (+\/-)-Pindolol also showed partial substitution (50%) for the eltoprazine cue, but NAN-190 and (+\/-)propranolol did not. It is concluded that the discriminatory stimulus properties of eltoprazine in the pigeon are mediated by 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors.","127":"Ligands with varying intrinsic activity and selectivity for the various subtypes of the serotonin receptor were tested in the rat pup ultrasonic vocalization (USV) model, a putative animal model reflecting anxiety. USV were elicited by isolating rat pups from their mother and littermates by placing them on a warm (37 degrees C) or a cold (18 degrees C) plate. Concurrently, the negative geotaxic (NG) response and rectal temperature were determined to assess the potentially sedative and hypothermic effects of putative anxiolytics. USV were reduced at low doses and in both temperature conditions by the full 5-HT1A receptor agonists flesinoxan and 8-OH-DPAT (8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin.HBr) and the partial 5-HT1A receptor agonists buspirone, ipsapirone and BMY 7378 (2-[4-[4-[2-pyrimidinyl]-1,2-piperazinyl]butyl]-1,2-benzi-isoth iozol-3-(2H)one-1,1-dioxide. 2HCl). The 5-HT1A receptor antagonists NAN-190 (1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phtalimido)-butyl]piperazide.2H Cl), (+\/-)-WAY 100,135 (+\/-)-(N-tert-butyl-3(4-(2-methoxy phenyl)piperazin-1 -yl)-2-phenyl propionamine.2HCl), and ((S)-UH-301 (S)-5-fluoro-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propyl-amino)tetralin.HBr) reduced USV at higher doses and only in one of both test conditions. The selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist DU 125530 (2-[4-[4[(7-chloro-2,3dihydro-4-benzodioxin-5-yl)-1-piperazi nyl]butyl]-1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one-1,1, dioxide, monomesylate), did not influence USV at the cold plate up to high doses, although concomitantly the negative geotaxis was disturbed. The negative geotaxis was impaired after all 5-HT1A receptor ligands, except BMY 7378 and (+\/-)-WAY 100,135. Hypothermia coincided with USV-suppression, except for NAN-190 and (S)-UH-301. The USV-suppressing action of flesinoxan (3 mg\/kg) could be antagonized by DU 125530, but not its NG effect. However, the hypothermia induced by flesinoxan was antagonized by DU 125530. USV were also suppressed by the 5-HT uptake inhibitors fluvoxamine (both warm and cold plate) and clomipramine (only warm plate). The tricyclic antidepressant imipramine only decreased USV on the cold plate, however, in a U-shaped dose-response curve. At the highest dose tested, no decrease was present. The 5-HT uptake stimulant tianeptine reduced USV under both conditions. Fluvoxamine had no side effects, clomipramine induced hypothermia and tianeptine clearly had sedative properties. The 5-HT1B\/2C receptor agonist TFMPP (trifluorometaphenylpiperazine) stimulated USV at a low dose at the cold plate and suppressed USV at a high dose under both conditions. The 5-HT2A\/2C receptor antagonist ketanserine enhanced USV at low doses under both conditions and had no effect at a higher dose. Concurrently heavy sedation and hypothermia occurred. The 5-HT3 receptor agonist phenylbiguanide and the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron had no effect in this paradigm. Clearly, subtypes of the 5-HT receptor affect rat pup USV differentially.","128":"The present study was undertaken to identify the receptor subtypes involved in (+\/-) pindolol's ability to enhance the effects of antidepressant drugs in the mouse forced swimming test. Interaction studies were performed with S 15535 (presynaptic 5-HT1A receptor agonist) and methiothepin (5-HT1B autoreceptor antagonist) in an attempt to attenuate or potentiate antidepressant-like activity. (+\/-) Pindolol was tested in combination with selective agonists and antagonists at 5-HT1, 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptor subtypes. Pretreatment with S 15535 and methiothepin attenuated the activity of paroxetine, fluvoxamine and citalopram (32 mg\/kg, i.p.; P < 0.01). (+\/-) Pindolol (32 mg\/kg, i.p.) induced significant anti-immobility effects when tested in combination with 5-methoxy-3-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridyl)-1H-indole (RU 24969) (1 mg\/kg, i.p.; P < 0.05), 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[-(2-phthalimido) butyl]piperazine) (NAN 190) (0.5 mg\/kg; P < 0.05) and ondansetron (0.00001 mg\/kg, i.p.; P < 0.01). Pretreatment with NAN 190 (0.5 mg\/kg, i.p.) potentiated the effects of RU 24969 (1 mg\/kg, i.p.; P < 0.05) and (+\/-) pindolol (32 mg\/kg, i.p.; P < 0.05) in the forced swimming test, as did ondansetron (0.00001 mg\/kg, i.p.). Significant additive effects were induced when RU 24969 (1 mg\/kg, i.p.) was tested in combination with NAN 190 (0.5 mg\/kg, i.p.; P < 0.05), (+\/-) pindolol (32 mg\/kg, i.p.; P < 0.05) and ondansetron (0.0000 mg\/kg, i.p.; P < 0.05). 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) (1 mg\/kg, i.p.) or ketanserin (8 mg\/kg, i.p.) did not induce significant antidepressant-like effects with any of the agonists\/antagonists tested. The results of the present study suggest that pindolol is acting at presynaptic 5-HT1B serotonergic receptors, in addition to the 5-HT1A subtype, in augmenting the activity of antidepressants in the mouse forced swimming test.","129":"Twelve homing pigeons were trained to discriminate the 5-HT1A receptor agonist flesinoxan (0.25 mg\/kg p.o.) from its vehicle in a fixed ratio (FR) 30 two-key operant drug discrimination procedure. Tests for generalization and antagonism showed that compounds with agonistic action at the 5-HT1A receptor, such as 8-OH-DPAT (8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin), buspirone and ipsapirone all substituted for the flesinoxan cue. Compounds with mixed agonistic action at the 5-HT(1A\/1B) receptor fully (eltoprazine) or partially (RU24969 (5-methoxy-3-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl-1H-indole)) substituted for flesinoxan. TFMPP (1-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine) and mCPP (1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine), both acting at the 5-HT(1B\/2C) receptor, did not substitute for flesinoxan, neither did the selective 5-HT re-uptake inhibitor fluvoxamine. The results of the antagonism tests showed that the 5-HT1A receptor antagonists NAN-190 (1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phthalimido)butyl]piperazine), WAY 100635 ((N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclo-he xane-carboxamide) and the newly developed DU125530 (2-[4-[4-(7-chloro-2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxin-5-yl)-1-piperazinyl ]butyl]-1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one-1,1-dioxide) fully (more than 80%) blocked the flesinoxan cue without having substantial effects when given alone. WAY100135 (N-tert-butyl-3-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine-1-yl)-2-phenylpropanamide ), (+\/-)-pindolol and (S)-UH-301 ((S)-5-fluoro-8-hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino)-tetralin) all partially antagonized the flesinoxan cue. However, both WAY100135 as well as (+\/-)-pindolol also partially substituted for flesinoxan in generalization tests. NAN190, (S)-UH-301, WAY100635 and DU125530 were without any activity in the generalization test at the doses tested. The putative 5-HT1A receptor antagonist S15535 (4-benzodioxan-5-yl) 1-(indan-2-yl)piperazine) was identified as a full agonist in the present procedure. Taken together these results suggest that the flesinoxan cue in pigeons is mediated by the 5-HT1A receptor and that DU125530 acts as a full antagonist on the 5-HT1A receptor.","130":"The forced swimming test is a behavioural model developed to predict the efficacy of antidepressant drugs. Few studies have been aimed at evaluating the mechanism of action of antidepressants in the forced swimming test. The present study was designed in order to further evaluate the mode of action of antidepressants in the forced swimming test, by using selective agonists and antagonists at 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptor sites. Agonists\/antagonists and antidepressants were administered 45 min and 30 min, respectively, prior to testing. Prior administration of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) (1 mg\/kg, i.p.) induced anti-immobility effects with the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine (8 mg\/kg, i.p.) and noradrenaline uptake inhibitors maprotiline (8 mg\/kg, i.p.) and desipramine (16 mg\/kg, i.p.), but not with fluoxetine (16 mg\/kg, i.p.), citalopram (16 mg\/kg, i.p.) or fluvoxamine (8 mg\/kg, i.p.). These effects were antagonised by prior administration of 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[-(2-phthalimido)butyl]piperazine) (NAN 190) (0.5 mg\/kg, i.p.). On the other hand, pretreatment with (+\/-)-pindolol (32 mg\/kg, i.p.) potentiated the effects of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and was devoid of any activity with imipramine (8 mg\/kg, i.p.), maprotiline (8 mg\/kg, i.p.) or desipramine (16 mg\/kg, i.p.). Prior administration of 5-methoxy-3-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridyl)-1H-indole (RU 24969) enhanced the antidepressant-like effects of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and imipramine (8 mg\/kg, i.p.) in the forced swimming test. The anti-immobility effects of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the forced swimming test seem to be mediated by presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors as well as postsynaptic 5-HT1B receptors. Antidepressant-like effects of the noradrenaline uptake inhibitors seem, on the other hand, to be mediated by postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. Considering the variety of 5-HT receptors, it is possible that other subtypes may participate in the anti-immobility effects of antidepressants in the forced swimming test.","131":"Several studies associate autism spectrum disorder (ASD) pathophysiology with metabolic abnormalities related to DNA methylation and intracellular redox homeostasis. In this regard, three completed clinical trials are reexamined in this work: treatment with (i) methylcobalamin (MeCbl) in combination with low-dose folinic acid (LDFA), (ii) tetrahydrobiopterin, and (iii) high-dose folinic acid (HDFA) for counteracting abnormalities in the folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism (FOCM) and transsulfuration (TS) pathways and also for improving ASD-related symptoms and behaviors. Although effects of treatment on individual metabolites and behavioral measures have previously been investigated, this study is the first to consider the effect of interventions on a set of metabolites of the FOCM\/TS pathways and to correlate FOCM\/TS metabolic changes with behavioral improvements across several studies. To do so, this work uses data from one case-control study and the three clinical trials to develop multivariate models for considering these aspects of treatment. Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) is first used to establish a model for distinguishing individuals with ASD from typically developing (TD) controls, which is subsequently evaluated on the three treatment data sets, along with one data set for a placebo, to characterize the shift of FOCM\/TS metabolism toward that of the TD population. Treatment with MeCbl plus LDFA and, separately, treatment with tetrahydrobiopterin significantly shifted the metabolites toward the values of the control group. Contrary to this, treatment with HDFA had a lesser, though still noticeable, effect whilst the placebo group showed marginal, but not insignificant, variations in metabolites. A second analysis is then performed with non-linear kernel partial least squares (KPLS) regression to predict changes in adaptive behavior, quantified by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Composite, from changes in FOCM\/TS biochemical measurements provided by treatment. Incorporating the 74 samples receiving any treatment, including placebo, into the regression analysis yields an <i>R<\/i> <sup>2<\/sup> of 0.471 after cross-validation when using changes in six metabolic measurements as predictors. These results are suggestive of an ability to effectively improve pathway-wide FOCM\/TS metabolic and behavioral abnormalities in ASD with clinical treatment.","132":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects about 1 in 45 individuals in the United States, yet effective treatments are yet to be defined. There is growing evidence that ASD is associated with abnormalities in several metabolic pathways, including the inter-connected folate, methylation and glutathione pathways. Several treatments that can therapeutically target these pathways have been tested in preliminary clinical trials. The combination of methylcobalamin (mB12) with low-dose folinic acid (LDFA) and sapropterin, a synthetic form of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) have been studied in open-label trials while high-dose folinic acid has been studied in a double-blind placebo controlled trial. All of these treatments have the potential to positively affect folate, methylation and glutathione pathways. Although the effect of mB12\/LDFA and BH4 on methylation and glutathione metabolism have been examined in the open-label studies, these changes have not been compared to controls who received a placebo in order to account for the natural variation in the changes in these pathways. Furthermore, the recent study using high-dose folinic acid (HDFA) did not analyze the change in metabolism resulting from the treatment. Thus, we compared changes in methylation and glutathione metabolism and biomarkers of chronic oxidative stress as a result of these three treatments to individuals receiving placebo. In general, mB12\/LDFA treatment had a significant effect on glutathione and cysteine metabolism with a medium effect size while BH4 had a significant effect on methylation and markers of chronic oxidative stress with a large effect size. HDFA treatment did not significantly influence biomarkers of methylation, glutathione or chronic oxidative stress. One caveat was that participants in the mB12\/LDFA and BH4 studies had significantly worse markers of glutathione metabolism and chronic oxidative stress at baseline, respectively. Thus, the participants selected in these two clinical trials may have been those with the most severe metabolic abnormalities and most expected to respond to these treatments. Overall this study supports the notion that metabolic abnormalities in individuals with ASD may be amenable to targeted treatments and provide some insight into the mechanism of action of these treatments.","133":"We sought to determine whether high-dose folinic acid improves verbal communication in children with non-syndromic autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and language impairment in a double-blind placebo control setting. Forty-eight children (mean age 7 years 4 \u2009months; 82% male) with ASD and language impairment were randomized to receive 12 weeks of high-dose folinic acid (2\u2009mg\u2009kg<sup>-1<\/sup> per day, maximum 50\u2009mg per day; n=23) or placebo (n=25). Children were subtyped by glutathione and folate receptor-\u03b1 autoantibody (FRAA) status. Improvement in verbal communication, as measured by a ability-appropriate standardized instrument, was significantly greater in participants receiving folinic acid as compared with those receiving placebo, resulting in an effect of 5.7 (1.0,10.4) standardized points with a medium-to-large effect size (Cohen's d=0.70). FRAA status was predictive of response to treatment. For FRAA-positive participants, improvement in verbal communication was significantly greater in those receiving folinic acid as compared with those receiving placebo, resulting in an effect of 7.3 (1.4,13.2) standardized points with a large effect size (Cohen's d=0.91), indicating that folinic acid treatment may be more efficacious in children with ASD who are FRAA positive. Improvements in subscales of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, the Aberrant Behavior Checklist, the Autism Symptom Questionnaire and the Behavioral Assessment System for Children were significantly greater in the folinic acid group as compared with the placebo group. There was no significant difference in adverse effects between treatment groups. Thus, in this small trial of children with non-syndromic ASD and language impairment, treatment with high-dose folinic acid for 12 weeks resulted in improvement in verbal communication as compared with placebo, particularly in those participants who were positive for FRAAs.","134":"This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of folinic acid\/placebo as an adjuvant to risperidone on inappropriate speech and other behavioral symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Fifty-five ASD children (age (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation)\u2009=\u200913.40\u2009\u00b1\u20092.00; male\/female: 35\/20) were evaluated for behavioral symptoms at baseline, week 5, and week 10 using the aberrant behavior checklist-community (ABC-C). Folinic acid dosage was 2\u00a0mg\/kg up to 50\u00a0mg per day for the entire course of the study. The repeated measures analysis showed significant effect for time\u2009\u00d7\u2009treatment interaction on inappropriate speech (F\u2009=\u20093.51; df\u2009=\u20091.61; P\u2009=\u20090.044), stereotypic behavior (F\u2009=\u20094.02; df\u2009=\u20091.37; P\u2009=\u20090.036), and hyperactivity\/noncompliance (F\u2009=\u20096.79; df\u2009=\u20091.66; P\u2009=\u20090.003) subscale scores. In contrast, no significant effect for time\u2009\u00d7\u2009treatment interaction was found on lethargy\/social withdrawal (F\u2009=\u20091.06; df\u2009=\u20091.57; P\u2009=\u20090.336) and irritability (F\u2009=\u20092.86; df\u2009=\u20091.91; P\u2009=\u20090.064) subscale scores. Our study provided preliminary evidence suggesting that folinic acid could be recommended as a beneficial complementary supplement for alleviating speech and behavioral symptoms in children with ASD.Clinical trial registeration: This trial was registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials ( www.irct.ir ; No. IRCT20090117001556N114).","135":null,"136":"The role of cholinergic abnormalities in autism was recently evidenced and there is a growing interest in cholinergic modulation, emerging for targeting autistic symptoms. Galantamine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and an allosteric potentiator of nicotinic receptors. This study aimed to evaluate the possible effects of galantamine as an augmentative therapy to risperidone, in autistic children. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, 40 outpatients aged 4-12 years whom had a diagnosis of autism (DSM IV-TR) and a score of 12 or higher on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) Irritability subscale were equally randomized to receive either galantamine (up to 24 mg\/day) or placebo, in addition to risperidone (up to 2 mg\/day), for 10 weeks. We rated participants by ABC-C and a side effects checklist, at baseline and at weeks 5 and 10. By the study endpoint, the galantamine-treated patients showed significantly greater improvement in the Irritability (P = 0.017) and Lethargy\/Social Withdrawal (P = 0.005) subscales than the placebo group. The difference between the two groups in the frequency of side effects was not significant. In conclusion, galantamine augmentation was shown to be a relatively effective and safe augmentative strategy for alleviating some of the autism-related symptoms.","137":"Ginkgo biloba has been reported to affect the neurotransmitter system and to have antioxidant properties that could impact the pathogenesis of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Based on these studies, we decided to assess the effectiveness of Ginkgo biloba extract (Ginko T.D., Tolidaru, Iran) as an adjunctive agent to risperidone in the treatment of autism. Forty-seven outpatients with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of autism ages between 4 and 12 years were assigned to this double blinded clinical trial and were randomly divided into two groups. One group received risperidone plus Ginko T.D and the other received risperidone plus placebo. The dose of risperidone was 1-3 mg\/day and the dose of Ginko T.D. was 80 mg\/day for patients under 30 kg and 120 mg\/day for patients above 30 kg. Patients were assessed using Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) rating scale and the side effect check list every 2 weeks until the endpoint. None of the 5 subscales of ABC-C rating scale showed significant differences between the two groups. Incidents of side effects were not significantly different between the two groups. Adding Ginkgo biloba to risperidone did not affect the treatment outcome of ADs. Nevertheless, further observations are needed to confirm this result.","138":"Long-term drug treatment of schizophrenia with conventional antipsychotics has limitations: an estimated quarter to one third of patients are treatment-resistant; conventional antipsychotics have only a modest impact upon negative symptoms (poverty of thought, social withdrawal and loss of affect); and adverse effects, particularly extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Newer, so-called atypical, antipsychotics such as olanzapine, risperidone, sertindole and clozapine (an old drug which was re-introduced in 1990) are claimed to address these limitations. Atypical agents are, at a minimum, at least as effective as conventional drugs such as haloperidol. They also cause substantially fewer extrapyramidal symptoms. However, some other adverse effects are more common than with conventional drugs. For example, clozapine carries a significant risk of serious blood disorders, for which special monitoring is mandatory; it also causes troublesome drowsiness and increased salivation more often than conventional agents. Some atypical agents cause more weight gain or QT prolongation than older agents. The choice of therapy is, therefore, not straightforward. At present, atypical agents represent an advance for patients with severe or intolerable EPS. Most published evidence exists to support the use of clozapine, which has also been shown to be effective in schizophrenia refractory to conventional agents. However, the need for compliance with blood count monitoring and its sedative properties make careful patient selection important. The extent of any additional direct benefit offered by atypical agents on negative symptoms is not yet clear. The lack of a depot formulation for atypical drugs may pose a significant practical problem. To date, only two double-blind studies in which atypical agents were compared directly have been published. Neither provides compelling evidence for the choice of one agent over another. Atypical agents are many times more expensive than conventional drugs. Although drug treatment constitutes only a small proportion of the costs of managing schizophrenia, the additional annual cost of the use of atypical agents in, say, a quarter of the likely U.K. schizophrenic population would be about 56 M pound sterling. There is only limited evidence of cost-effectiveness. Atypical antipsychotics are not currently licensed for other conditions where conventional antipsychotics are commonly used, such as behaviour disturbance or dementia in the elderly. Their dose, and place in treatment in such cases have yet to be determined.","139":"To report results from a long-term prospective study of safety of haloperidol treatment and prevalence of haloperidol-related dyskinesias. Subjects were children with autism requiring pharmacotherapy for target symptoms. After baseline assessments, children received haloperidol treatment; responders requiring further treatment were considered for enrollment into the present study. Six-month haloperidol treatment periods were followed by a 4-week placebo period. The procedure was repeated if further haloperidol treatment was required. At specified times children were evaluated by using multiple instruments. Between 1979 and 1994, 118 children aged 2.3 to 8.2 years participated in the study. The mean dose of haloperidol was 1.75 mg\/day. Mainly withdrawal dyskinesias (WD) developed in 40 (33.9%) children; 20 had more than one dyskinetic episode. A subgroup that remained significantly longer in the study and had a significantly higher cumulative dose of haloperidol evidenced a significantly higher incidence of WD. Occurrence rates of tardive dyskinesia (TD) and multiple episodes of TD\/WD were higher among girls. Female gender and pre- and perinatal complications may be involved in susceptibility to dyskinesias; greater cumulative haloperidol dose and\/or longer exposure to haloperidol may increase the risk.","140":"Aggressive behavior is difficult to capture with most available rating instruments because it occurs with low frequency. The Overt Aggression Scale (OAS) was designed to capture all incidents on a 24-hour basis. To assess its usefulness, the OAS was piloted on 16 hospitalized, severely aggressive children with conduct disorder. OAS ratings capture episodes of aggressive behavior, measure trends in aggressive behavior over time, and appear to reflect change associated with pharmacotherapy in hospitalized children. This study suggests that the use of the OAS on a children's psychiatric inpatient unit is appropriate and feasible for clinical as well as research purposes.","141":"This study compared live ratings with ratings of videotapes and compared response to clomipramine with response to haloperidol in 8 subjects, mean age 5.62 years, who met criteria for autism. They were consecutive admissions to a pilot study of clomipramine (n = 4) or a double-blind, placebo controlled study of haloperidol (n = 4). Live ratings were performed by two raters at the end of the pre-treatment placebo baseline period and at the end of the drug treatment period on the CPRS and the CGI and were videotaped. Employing the same instruments, these videotapes were rated by two raters who did not know the subjects and were blind to study design, treatment, and study phase. Ratings of videotapes significantly differed from live ratings. A treatment effect for haloperidol was detected only on live ratings and not on ratings of videotapes. No treatment effect was detected for clomipramine in either live or videotape ratings.","142":"It has been hypothesized that an association exists between pre- and perinatal complications, central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, and the development of tardive (TD) and withdrawal dyskinesias (WD). We assessed the relationship between pre- and perinatal complications and TD\/WD in a sample of 118 children with autism who participated in an ongoing long-term prospective study of the efficacy and safety of haloperidol. The mean total Rochester Research Obstetrical Scale (ROS) score was significantly higher for children who developed TD\/WD compared to those who did not (p = .007) as was the mean score of the ROS Delivery Scale (p = .002). Anesthesia during delivery was more frequent in children who developed TD\/WD (25 of 40, 62.5%) than in those who did not (30 of 78, 38.5%) (p = .019). The ROS Not Vertex Presentation item and TD\/WD were associated only in females (p = .019). Six of 7 males with short labor developed TD\/WD (p = .007). ROS scores did not differ significantly as a function of gender or socio-economic status (SES). Pre- and perinatal complications appear to be related to the development of TD\/WD in this sample of children.","143":"This article presents data on the diagnosis and phenomenology of schizophrenia in 16 hospitalized children, ages 5.5 to 11.75 years. These 16 subjects are the first to complete an ongoing double-blind, placebo-controlled study of haloperidol in children with schizophrenia diagnosed by DSM-III-R criteria. We describe the pharmacologic treatment response of this subsample and compare our diagnostic, phenomenologic, and treatment findings with those of other investigators. Our results show that children under age 12 can be diagnosed with schizophrenia by the same criteria used for adults, that they show comparable clinical symptoms, and that on haloperidol they show improvement in target psychotic symptoms, at least in a short-term inpatient setting.","144":"The long-term effects of haloperidol on weight were assessed in 30 children, 25 males and 5 females, diagnosed with autistic disorder whose ages ranged from 3.08 to 8.42 years. They received haloperidol (0.25-3.50 mg\/day; mean 1.26 +\/- 0.84) for 6 months followed by a 4-week drug withdrawal period. Weights obtained on the last day of the 6-month haloperidol period were compared to weights obtained following drug withdrawal. There was no significant difference between the mean weights obtained on the last day of haloperidol administration (24.799 +\/- 9.741 kg) compared to the mean weights at the end of the fourth week of the placebo period (24.644 +\/- 9.833 kg). Weights increased during the first week of drug discontinuation (24.879 +\/- 9.855 kg), but decreased during each following week of drug withdrawal. Weight was measured monthly during the 6-month haloperidol treatment period for 8 of the 30 subjects. In this subsample, weight gain was greater during the 1-month period lasting from the end of the 4-week drug withdrawal to the end of the first month after resuming haloperidol treatment than weight gain prior to drug withdrawal, between the fifth and sixth month of haloperidol treatment.","145":"Plasma beta-endorphin levels were measured in 13 autistic children, aged 3.67 to 11.67 years at the end of treatment (naltrexone, haloperidol, pimozide, or placebo) and in 5 of the 13 children also at baseline. Baseline plasma beta-endorphin levels were lower than those reported in the literature. There was a strong correlation between plasma beta-endorphin levels and severity of sterotypies in all children. Naltrexone did not seem to have a specific effect on plasma beta-endorphin levels; short-term haloperidol treatment was associated with an increase, whereas long-term haloperidol treatment seemed to have a depressive effect on plasma beta-endorphin levels, which rose after withdrawal of haloperidol.","146":"This report presents preliminary findings in an ongoing double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the safety and efficacy of haloperidol in hospitalized schizophrenic children. The subjects are diagnosed schizophrenic by DSM-III-R criteria and admitted to the Bellevue Hospital Children's Inpatient Psychiatric Unit. The study is 10 weeks in duration and employs a crossover design. After a 2-week placebo baseline period, the subjects enter double-blind treatment for 8 weeks, by random assignment receiving either haloperidol for 4 weeks followed by placebo for 4 weeks, or alternatively, placebo for 4 weeks followed by haloperidol for 4 weeks. Dosage, regulated individually, ranges from 0.5 to 10.0 mg\/day. To date, of an anticipated 20 subjects, 12 have completed the study. These children, 9 boys and 3 girls, were ages 5.5 to 11.75 years upon study entry. Haloperidol was superior to placebo for reduction of target symptoms with optimal haloperidol dose of 0.5 to 3.5 mg\/day (0.02-0.12 mg\/kg\/day).","147":"A secondary analysis of data pooled from three studies (Anderson et al. 1984, 1989; Campbell et al. 1978) was performed to identify variables predictive of haloperidol response in 125 autistic children, with ages ranging from 2.3 to 8.2 years. Mean behavioral improvement was greater under haloperidol treatment conditions than under placebo. Higher intelligence quotient (IQ) was predictive of reduction in behavioral symptoms under general conditions of haloperidol or placebo treatment, while older children were found to respond favorably to haloperidol itself. Under both haloperidol and placebo conditions, there was also a tendency for greater reduction in symptoms, in terms of raw score and percent change, for those with greater initial severity of illness. Results for initial severity of illness as a predictor of improvement generalized across a wide variety of behavior not specific to autism (e.g., hyperactivity and temper outbursts). However, mean behavioral improvement and its prediction with demographics for individuals tended to be more specific to symptoms related to autism per se. Reduction in symptoms during short-term haloperidol treatment was not found to be related to whether or not children developed dyskinesias in subsequent long-term haloperidol administration.","148":"The use of haloperidol in pain management has been a topic of interest for several decades. Haloperidol is a widely used antipsychotic medication with unique pharmacologic properties that make it a potential candidate for pain management. However, the efficacy and safety of haloperidol for pain management remain controversial. This narrative review provides a summary of the current literature on the use of haloperidol for pain management, including its pharmacology, clinical effectiveness, adverse effects, and dosing regimens. We performed a comprehensive search of the literature for this review. The most robust clinical data from the past decade suggest that haloperidol has good efficacy in the treatment of pain related to gastroparesis and migraines and has shown promise for opioid use reduction in patients with chronic pain or receiving palliative care. The overall side effect profile is excellent, with zero reported events of QT-related cardiac arrest and minimal reports of sedation and transient extrapyramidal effects such as akathisia. Dosing regimens used were heterogeneous, with most ranging from 1 to 5 mg per dose via intravenous, intramuscular, or oral route. Studies with designs that isolated the effects of haloperidol from combinations of other drugs were extremely limited. Further high-quality prospective studies are needed to determine the ideal role of haloperidol in the routine clinical management of painful conditions.","149":"Self-grooming behavior in rodents serves as a valuable behavioral index for investigating stereotyped and perseverative responses. Most current grooming analyses rely on video observation, which lacks standardization, efficiency, and quantitative information about force. To address these limitations, we developed an automated paradigm to analyze grooming using a force-plate actometer. Grooming behavior is quantified by calculating ratios of relevant movement power spectral bands. These ratios are input into a na\u00efve Bayes classifier, trained with manual video observations. The effectiveness of this method was tested using CIN-d mice, an animal model developed through early-life depletion of striatal cholinergic interneurons (CIN-d) and featuring prolonged grooming responses to acute stressors. Behavioral monitoring was simultaneously conducted on the force-place actometer and by video recording. The na\u00efve Bayes approach achieved 93.7% accurate classification and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.894. We confirmed that male CIN-d mice displayed significantly longer grooming durations than controls. However, this elevation was not correlated with increases in grooming force. Notably, the dopaminergic antagonist haloperidol reduced grooming force and duration. In contrast to observation-based approaches, our method affords rapid, unbiased, and automated assessment of grooming duration, frequency, and force. Our novel approach enables fast and accurate automated detection of grooming behaviors. This method holds promise for high-throughput assessments of grooming stereotypies in animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders.","150":"This study aimed to evaluate Haloperidol's (Hal) effects on the behavioral, neurotrophic factors, and epigenetic parameters in an animal model of schizophrenia (SCZ) induced by ketamine (Ket). Injections of Ket or saline were administered intraperitoneal (once a day) between the 1st and 14th days of the experiment. Water or Hal was administered via gavage between the 8th and 14th experimental days. Thirty minutes after the last injection, the animals were subjected to behavioral analysis. The activity of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), histone deacetylase (HDAC), and histone acetyltransferase and levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) were evaluated in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. Ket increased the covered distance and time spent in the central area of the open field, and Hal did not reverse these behavioral alterations. Significant increases in the DNMT and HDAC activities were detected in the frontal cortex and striatum from rats that received Ket, Hal, or a combination thereof. Besides, Hal per se increased the activity of DNMT and HDAC in the hippocampus of rats. Hal per se or the association of Ket plus Hal decreased BDNF, NGF, NT-3, and GDNF, depending on the brain region and treatment regimen. The administration of Hal can alter the levels of neurotrophic factors and the activity of epigenetic enzymes, which can be a factor in the development of effect collateral in SCZ patients. However, the precise mechanisms involved in these alterations are still unclear.","151":"Self-grooming behavior in rodents serves as a valuable model for investigating stereotyped and perseverative responses.

Although frequently missed, the effective recognition of delirium demands attention and commitment. Reversibility is frequently not achievable. Non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions are commonly used but largely unproven. Palliative sedation, although controversial, should be considered for refractory delirium. Psychological assistance should be available to patients and their families at all times.","153":"Agitated delirium is common and highly distressing. Medications are often needed to reduce agitation, but it is unclear what the desired level of sedation is. This study assessed personalized sedation goals (PSGs) and their predictors for patients in a delirium clinical trial and in clinical vignettes. This was a preplanned secondary analysis of a double-blind randomized clinical trial examining the sedative effect of chlorpromazine and\/or haloperidol in patients with agitated delirium. At the baseline, caregivers and nurses were independently asked to select the PSG for the trial patient from 5 choices corresponding to Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) scores of 0 or higher (no sedation), -1 to -2, -3, -4, and -5 (deep sedation). Respondents also selected a PSG for 6 vignettes that differed by the level of agitation, ability to communicate, and survival. Forty-two caregivers and 39 nurses answered questions regarding PSGs. For the trial patient, caregivers preferred RASS scores of -1 to -2 most often (36%), whereas nurses preferred an RASS score of -3 most often (51 %). Caregivers were significantly more likely than nurses to choose lighter sedation (odds ratio [OR], 4.8; P = .01) despite reporting greater delirium-related distress (P = .0006). Patients were undersedated 33% to 53% of the time and oversedated 0% to 15% of the time according to the PSG response criteria. In the case vignettes, deeper sedation was preferred by nurses (P < .0001) and for patients who were unable to communicate (OR, 3.1-4.4; P < .0001) and had a shorter life expectancy (OR, 1.7; P = .002). Caregivers often preferred lighter sedation than nurses. Many patients were undersedated in comparison with caregivers' PSGs, and this highlights room for improvement. In the last days of life, many patients with cancer develop delirium and become restless\/agitated; this can be highly distressing. Caregivers and physicians alike are often concerned about the use of sedatives for agitated delirium and try to find a balance between maximizing comfort and maintaining communication. This study examined the concept of a personalized sedation goal for setting an individualized target for the level of sedation. Caregivers often preferred lighter sedation than nurses. Many patients were undersedated in comparison with caregivers' stated goals, and this highlights room for improvement.","154":"Nausea and vomiting are a common clinical symptom in the advanced cancer patient. Pharmacologic management is important. Evidence for drug choices and guidelines are needed to help clinicians manage nausea and vomiting in this population METHODS: Evidence from a systematic review published in 2010, initial MASCC guidelines developed from a systematic review of literature to 2015, and a new systematic review of randomized trials published between 2015 and February 2, 2021, was combined to establish a new guideline. A search of the literature between 2015 and February 2, 2021, revealed 257 abstracts of which there was one systematic review and 4 randomized trials which were used to modify the guideline. The new guideline is as follows: First Line: Metoclopramide (II) multiple small RCTs including a placebo-controlled trial, haloperidol (II) multiple non-placebo-controlled RCTs, high consensus. Second line: Methotrimeprazine (II) 1 well-powered non-placebo-controlled RCT, olanzapine (II) 1 placebo-controlled pilot RCT, high consensus. Third line: Tropisetron (II) large unblinded lower quality non-placebo-controlled RCT, levosulpiride (II) 1 blinded non-placebo-controlled pilot RCT, high consensus. Haloperidol, metoclopramide, methotrimeprazine, olanzapine tropisetron, and levosulpiride have been antiemetics used in randomized trials with antiemetic activity demonstrated. There are only three placebo-controlled randomized trials we could find in our literature review. Placebo responses varied significantly between two randomized trials. More randomized placebo-controlled trials with either metoclopramide or haloperidol rescue are needed to clarify antiemetic choices in advanced cancer. First-line antiemetics for nausea and vomiting in advanced cancer are metoclopramide and haloperidol, and second-line medications are methotrimeprazine and olanzapine.","155":"Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) is a frequent complication in patients with advanced cancer, particularly colon or gynecological malignancies. MASCC previously published a guideline for symptom management of MBO in 2017. This is a 5-year update. A systematic search and review of relevant literature includes a review published in 2010 and 2017. The guideline update used the same literature search process as followed in 2015. The dates of the new search included 2015 up to February 2, 2021. The guidelines involved the pharmacologic management of nausea and vomiting in malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) only. Only randomized trials were included in the updated guideline as evidence. The evidence was reviewed by the panel and the MASCC criteria for establishing a guideline were followed using MASCC level of grading and category of evidence. There was one systematic review and 3 randomized trials accepted as evidence from 257 abstracts. Octreotide is effective in reducing gastrointestinal secretions and colic and thereby reduces nausea and vomiting caused by MBO. Scopolamine butylbromide is inferior to octreotide in the doses used in the comparison study. Olanzapine or metoclopramide may be effective in reducing nausea and vomiting secondary to partial bowel obstructions. The panel suggests using either drug. Additional studies are needed to clarify benefits. Haloperidol has been used by convention as an antiemetic but has not been subjected to a randomized comparison. Ranitidine plus dexamethasone may be effective in reducing nausea and vomiting from MBO but cannot be recommended until there is a comparison with octreotide. Octreotide remains the drug of choice in managing MBO. Ranitidine was used in one randomized trial in all participants and so its effectiveness as a single drug is not known until there is a randomized comparison with octreotide. Antiemetics such as metoclopramide and olanzapine may be effective, but we have very few randomized trials of antiemetics in MBO. The panel recommends octreotide in non-operable MBO. Randomized trials are needed to clarify ranitidine and antiemetic choices.","156":"Few studies have examined how the use of rescue medications could be used to inform on the efficacy of interventions in delirium clinical trials. The objective of this study was to determine the association among rescue medication use, Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS), and perceived comfort by the nurses and caregivers. This was a pre-planned secondary analysis of a double-blind, randomized clinical trial comparing the use of a single dose of lorazepam plus haloperidol versus placebo plus haloperidol in patients with agitated delirium. Rescue medications were considered the gold standard for this analysis. The optimal cutoff for RASS analysis was calculated by using general linear regression models and determining the area of the curve and using the top left approach. We used 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 tables to examine the association between rescue medication use and perceived comfort. Fifty-eight patients received the study medications and 52 (89%) completed the 8-h observation period. There were 26 (50%) patients in each arm. The lorazepam\/haloperidol arm required fewer rescue doses (4\/26 (15%)) vs. 16\/26 (62%), p\u2009=\u20090.004). Patients with a greater initial RASS reduction required fewer rescue doses. The cutoff value for RASS improvement was 4 points, area under the curve (AUC) 0.64 (95% CI 0.49-0.79) for those who required no rescue doses, and 3 points, AUC 0.74 (95% CI 0.52-0.96) for those who required more than one rescue dose. Rescue medication use was responsive to change and associated with both RASS scores and perceived patient comfort by the nurse and caregiver.","157":"The present study aims to evaluate the effects of haloperidol, an important first-generation antipsychotic, on the antioxidant system parameters in the brain of animals subjected to a model of schizophrenia induced by ketamine. Adult rats intraperitoneally received saline (1\u2009mL\/kg) or ketamine (25\u2009mg\/kg body weight) for 15 days, and saline or haloperidol (0.1\u2009mg\/kg body weight) via gavage once a day, between the 9th and 14th days. In the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum, assessments of lipid (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal and 8-isoprostane levels) and protein (protein carbonyl content) oxidative damage were conducted. It was also measured the glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase activities in the same cerebral structures. Increases in the 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal and 8-isoprostane levels were detected in rats receiving haloperidol and ketamine. An increase in the carbonyl content was also observed in animals receiving ketamine, haloperidol, or a combination thereof. In animals receiving the antipsychotic, there was a decrease in the activity of the enzymes. Therefore, both ketamine and haloperidol induced oxidative damage. A possible energy dysfunction or a haloperidol effect targeting the glutathione enzymes, and then disrupting the redox homeostasis in neurons, could not be ruled out, although further studies are required to confirm or refute a direct interaction.","158":"Although initially showing great potential, oxytocin treatment has encountered a translational hurdle in its promise of treating the social deficits of autism. Some debate surrounds the ability of oxytocin to successfully enter the brain, and therefore modify neuroanatomy. Moreover, given the heterogeneous nature of autism, treatment will only amerliorate symptoms in a subset of patients. Therefore, to determine whether oxytocin changes brain circuitry, and whether it does so variably, depending on genotype, we implemented a large randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, preclinical study on chronic intranasal oxytocin treatment in three different mouse models related to autism with a focus on using neuroanatomical phenotypes to assess and subset treatment response. Intranasal oxytocin (0.6IU) was administered daily, for 28 days, starting at 5 weeks of age to the 16p11.2 deletion, Shank3 (exon 4-9) knockout, and Fmr1 knockout mouse models. Given the sensitivity of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to the neurological effects of interventions like drugs, along with many other advantages, the mice underwent in vivo longitudinal and high-resolution ex vivo imaging with MRI. The scans included three in vivo T1weighted, 90\u00a0um isotropic resolution scans and a T2-weighted, 3D fast spin echo with 40um isotropic resolution ex vivo scan to assess the changes in neuroanatomy using established automated image registration and deformation based morphometry approaches in response to oxytocin treatment. The behavior of the mice was assessed in multiple domains, including social behaviours and repetitive behaviours, among others. Treatment effect on the neuroanatomy did not reach significance, although the pattern of trending effects was promising. No significant effect of treatment was found on social behavior in any of the strains, although a significant effect of treatment was found in the Fmr1 mouse, with treatment normalizing a grooming deficit. No other treatment effect on behavior was observed that survived multiple comparisons correction. Overall, chronic treatment with oxytocin had limited effects on the three mouse models related to autism, and no promising pattern of response susceptibility emerged.","159":"There is a paucity of treatments targeting core symptom domains in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Several animal models and research in typically developing volunteers suggests that manipulation of the oxytocin system may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of social deficits. We review the literature for oxytocin and ASD and report on early dosing, safety and efficacy data of multi-dose oxytocin on aspects of social cognition\/function, as well as repetitive behaviors and co-occurring anxiety within ASD. Fifteen children and adolescents with verbal IQs\u226570 were diagnosed with ASD using the ADOS and the ADI-R. They participated in a modified maximum tolerated dose study of intranasal oxytocin (Syntocinon). Data were modeled using repeated measures regression analysis controlling for week, dose, age, and sex. Among 4 doses tested, the highest dose evaluated, 0.4 IU\/kg\/dose, was found to be well tolerated. No serious or severe adverse events were reported and adverse events reported\/observed were mild to moderate. Over 12 weeks of treatment, several measures of social cognition\/function, repetitive behaviors and anxiety showed sensitivity to change with some measures suggesting maintenance of effect 3 months past discontinuation of intranasal oxytocin. This pilot study suggests that daily administration of intranasal oxytocin at 0.4 IU\/kg\/dose in children and adolescents with ASD is safe and has therapeutic potential. Larger studies are warranted. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Oxytocin and Social Behav.","160":"There are no effective medications for the treatment of social cognition\/function deficits in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and adult intervention literature in this area is sparse. Emerging data from animal models and genetic association studies as well as early, single-dose intervention studies suggest that the oxytocin system may be a potential therapeutic target for social cognition\/function deficits in ASD. The primary aim of this study was to examine the safety\/therapeutic effects of intranasal oxytocin versus placebo in adults with ASD, with respect to the two core symptom domains of social cognition\/functioning and repetitive behaviors. This was a pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design trial of intranasal oxytocin versus placebo in 19 adults with ASD (16 males; 33.20 \u00b1 13.29 years). Subjects were randomized to 24 IU intranasal oxytocin or placebo in the morning and afternoon for 6 weeks. Measures of social function\/cognition (the Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy) and repetitive behaviors (Repetitive Behavior Scale Revised) were administered. Secondary measures included the Social Responsiveness Scale, Reading-the-Mind-in-the-Eyes Test and the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale - compulsion subscale and quality of life (World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire - emotional\/social subscales). Full-information maximum-likelihood parameter estimates were obtained and tested using mixed-effects regression analyses. Although no significant changes were detected in the primary outcome measures after correcting for baseline differences, results suggested improvements after 6 weeks in measures of social cognition (Reading-the-Mind-in-the-Eyes Test, p = 0.002, d = 1.2), and quality of life (World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire - emotion, p = 0.031, d = 0.84), both secondary measures. Oxytocin was well tolerated and no serious adverse effects were reported. This pilot study suggests that there is therapeutic potential to daily administration of intranasal oxytocin in adults with ASD and that larger and longer studies are warranted. NCT00490802.","161":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by persistent social interaction impairments and is male-biased in prevalence. We have established naturally occurring low sociality in male rhesus monkeys as a model for the social features of ASD. Low-social male monkeys exhibit reduced social interactions and increased autistic-like trait burden, with both measures highly correlated and strongly linked to low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) arginine vasopressin (AVP) concentration. Little is known, however, about the behavioral and neurochemical profiles of female rhesus monkeys, and whether low sociality in females is a tractable model for ASD. Social behavior assessments (ethological observations; a reverse-translated autistic trait measurement scale, the macaque Social Responsiveness Scale-Revised [mSRS-R]) were completed on N\u2009=\u200988 outdoor-housed female rhesus monkeys during the non-breeding season. CSF and blood samples were collected from a subset of N\u2009=\u200916 monkeys across the frequency distribution of non-social behavior, and AVP and oxytocin (OXT) concentrations were quantified. Data were analyzed using general linear models. Non-social behavior frequency and mSRS-R scores were continuously distributed across the general female monkey population, as previously found for male monkeys. However, dominance rank significantly predicted mSRS-R scores in females, with higher-ranking individuals showing fewer autistic-like traits, a relationship not previously observed in males from this colony. Females differed from males in several other respects: Social behavior frequencies were unrelated to mSRS-R scores, and AVP concentration was unrelated to any social behavior measure. Blood and CSF concentrations of AVP were positively correlated in females; no significant relationship involving any OXT measure was found. This study sample was small, and did not consider genetic, environmental, or other neurochemical measures that may be related to female mSRS-R scores. Dominance rank is the most significant predictor of autistic-like traits in female rhesus monkeys, and CSF neuropeptide concentrations are unrelated to measures of female social functioning (in contrast to prior CSF AVP findings in male rhesus monkeys and male and female autistic children). Although preliminary, this evidence suggests that the strong matrilineal organization of this species may limit the usefulness of low sociality in female rhesus monkeys as a tractable model for ASD.","162":"This narrative review charts my unconventional path to becoming a social neuroscientist and describes my research findings - some baffling, some serendipitous, some pivotal - in the field of neuropeptide biology. I trace my childhood as a Bell Labs \"brat\" to my adolescence as a soccer-playing party girl, to my early days as a graduate student, when I first encountered oxytocin and vasopressin. These two molecules instantly captivated - and held - my attention and imagination. For more than 25 years, a core goal of my research program has been to better understand how these neuropeptides regulate social functioning across a range of species (e.g., meadow voles, mice, squirrel monkeys, rhesus monkeys, and humans), and to translate fundamental insights from this work to guide development of novel pharmacotherapies to treat social impairments in clinical populations. I also discuss my experience of being a woman and a mother in STEM, and identify the important people and events which helped shape my career and the scientist I am today.","163":"Significant clinical improvement is often observed in patients who receive placebo treatment in randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials. While a proportion of this \"improvement\" reflects experimental design limitations (e.g., reliance on subjective outcomes, unbalanced groups, reporting biases), some of it reflects genuine improvement corroborated by physiological change. Converging evidence across diverse medical conditions suggests that clinically-relevant benefits from placebo treatment are associated with the activation of brain reward circuits. In parallel, evidence has accumulated showing that such benefits are facilitated by clinicians that demonstrate warmth and proficiency during interactions with patients. Here, we integrate research on these neural and social aspects of placebo effects with evidence linking oxytocin and social reward to advance a neurobiological account for the social facilitation of placebo effects. This account frames oxytocin as a key mediator of treatment success across a wide-spectrum of interventions that increase social connectedness, thereby\u00a0providing a biological basis for assessing this fundamental non-specific element of medical care.","164":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by core social deficits. Prognosis is poor, in part, because existing medications target only associated ASD features. Emerging evidence suggests that the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) may be a blood-based biomarker of social functioning and a possible treatment for ASD. However, prior OXT treatment trials have produced equivocal results, perhaps because of variability in patients' underlying neuropeptide biology, but this hypothesis has not been tested. Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design, we tested the efficacy and tolerability of 4-wk intranasal OXT treatment (24 International Units, twice daily) in 32 children with ASD, aged 6-12 y. When pretreatment neuropeptide measures were included in the statistical model, OXT compared with placebo treatment significantly enhanced social abilities in children with ASD [as measured by the trial's primary outcome measure, the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS)]. Importantly, pretreatment blood OXT concentrations also predicted treatment response, such that individuals with the lowest pretreatment OXT concentrations showed the greatest social improvement. OXT was well tolerated, and its effects were specific to social functioning, with no observed decrease in repetitive behaviors or anxiety. Finally, as with many trials, some placebo-treated participants showed improvement on the SRS. This enhanced social functioning was mirrored by a posttreatment increase in their blood OXT concentrations, suggesting that increased endogenous OXT secretion may underlie this improvement. These findings indicate that OXT treatment enhances social abilities in children with ASD and that individuals with pretreatment OXT signaling deficits may stand to benefit the most from OXT treatment.","165":"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a rare inherited genetic disorder causing severe intellectual disability and autistic-like symptoms. Individuals with FXS, males in particular, often exhibit extreme eye gaze avoidance and hyperarousal when they encounter stressful social situations. We investigated whether oxytocin (OT), a hormone with prosocial and anxiolytic effects, could alleviate symptoms of social anxiety in this population. A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled single-dose trial was performed with intranasal administration of placebo, 24 IU OT and 48 IU OT. Measures of eye gaze frequency, heart rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), heart rate variability (HRV) and salivary cortisol were obtained during a structured social challenge conducted 50 min following OT administration. Ten low-functioning males with FXS (aged 13-28 years) traveled to Stanford for the initial visit: 8 completed the study. Eye gaze frequency improved significantly in response to the 24 IU OT dose and salivary cortisol levels decreased significantly in response to the 48 IU OT dose. There was no effect of OT on heart rate, RSA or HRV although individual plots of the heart rate data suggested that OT increased heart rate in some participants and decreased heart rate in others. These findings suggest that intranasal administration of OT may ameliorate some symptoms of social anxiety in patients with FXS. Further double-blind placebo-controlled studies of OT, conducted in combination with behavioral treatment programs, may be warranted.","166":"Social relationships protect against the development of stress-related psychiatric disorders, yet little is known about the neurobiology that regulates this phenomenon. Recent evidence suggests that oxytocin (OT), a neuropeptide involved in social bond formation, may play a role. This experiment investigated the effects of chronic intranasal OT administration on acute stress-induced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation in adult female squirrel monkeys. Subjects were randomized to one of two experimental conditions. Monkeys were intranasally administered either 50 microg oxytocin (N = 6 monkeys) or 0 microg oxytocin (N = 6 monkeys)\/300 microl saline once a day for eight consecutive days. Immediately after drug administration on the eighth day, all monkeys were exposed to acute social isolation. Blood samples for determinations of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol concentrations were collected after 30 and 90 min of stress exposure. Consistent with an anti-stress effect, OT-treated monkeys exhibited lower ACTH concentrations compared to saline-treated monkeys after 90 min of social isolation (F(1,7) = 6.891; P = 0.034). No drug-related differences in cortisol levels were observed, indicating that OT does not directly attenuate the adrenal stress response. Intranasal peptide administration has been shown to penetrate the central nervous system, and research must determine whether intranasally delivered OT exerts its effect(s) at a pituitary and\/or brain level. This primate model offers critical opportunities to improve our understanding of the anti-stress effects of OT and may lead to novel pharmacological treatments for stress-related psychiatric disorders.","167":"Sleep disorders are frequently reported in autistic patients. Evidences suggest that increased oxidative stress and reduced antioxidants may play a major role in the pathogenesis of these disorders. Carnosine acts as an antioxidant, antitoxic and neuroprotective agent. The aim of this trial study was to examine the effects of carnosine supplementation on the sleep disorders and severity of autism core symptoms in autistic patients. In this double-blind, randomized clinical trial, 43 autistic patients (31 boys and 12 girls; aged 4 to 16 years) were divided into two groups of carnosine and control that received 500 mg of carnosine and 500 mg of placebo per day for 2 months, respectively. Sleep disorders were measured using Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaires. Gilliam Autism Rating Scale 2 was used to assess the effects of carnosine supplementation on the autism severity. Carnosine supplementation did not change anthropometric indices (p > 0.05) and showed no effect on autism severity (p > 0.05), whereas it significantly reduced sleep duration (p = 0.04), parasomnias (p = 0.02) and total sleep disorders score by 7.59% (p = 0.006) when compared with the control group. The results suggest that carnosine supplementation could be effective in improving sleep disturbances, in particular sleep duration and parasomnias subscales.","168":"L-Carnitine is a naturally occurring substance required in mammalian energy metabolism that functions by facilitating long-chain fatty acid entry into cellular mitochondria, thereby delivering substrate for oxidation and subsequent energy production. It has been purposed that L-carnitine may improve and preserve cognitive performance, and may lead to better cognitive aging through the life span, and several controlled human clinical trials with L-carnitine support the hypothesis that this substance has the ability to improve cognitive function. We further hypothesized that, since L-carnitine is an important co-factor of mammalian mitochondrial energy metabolism, acute administration of L-carnitine to human tissue culture cells should result in detectable increases in mitochondrial function. Cultures of SH-SY-5Y human neuroblastoma and 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells grown in 96-well cell culture plates were acutely administered L-carnitine hydrochloride, and then, mitochondrial function was assayed using the colorimetric 2,3-bis[2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxyanilide inner salt cell assay kit in a VERSAmax tunable microplate reader. Significant increases in mitochondrial function were observed when human neuroblastoma or human astrocytoma cells were exposed to 100 nM (20 \u03bcg L-carnitine hydrochloride\/L) to 100 \u03bcM (20 mg L-carnitine hydrochloride\/L) concentrations of L-carnitine hydrochloride in comparison to unexposed cells, whereas no significant positive effects were observed at lower or higher concentrations of L-carnitine hydrochloride. The results of the present study provide insights for how L-carnitine therapy may significantly improve human neuronal function, but we recommend that future studies further explore different derivatives of L-carnitine compounds in different in vitro cell-based systems using different markers of mitochondrial function.","169":"L-carnitine was proposed as a potential treatment for patients diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder to improve mitochondrial dysfunction, but no prior randomized controlled trials have been conducted. Thirty subjects diagnosed with an ASD were randomly assigned to receive a standardized regimen (50 mg L-carnitine\/kg bodyweight\/day) of liquid L-carnitine (n=19) or placebo (n=11) for 3-months. Measures included changes in professionally completed Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), hand muscle testing, and modified clinical global impression (CGI) forms; parent completed Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC), treatment adherence measurement (TAM), frequency and intensity of side effect rating (FISER)\/global rating of side effect burden (GRSEB)\/patient report of incidence of side effects (PRISE) forms; and lab testing. Significant improvements were observed in CARS (-2.03, 95% CI=-3.7 to -0.31), CGI (-0.69, 95% CI=-1.1 to -0.06), and ATEC scores. Significant correlations between changes in serum free-carnitine levels and positive clinical changes were observed for hand muscle strength (R2=0.23, P=0.046), cognitive scores (R2=0.27, P=0.019), and CARS scores (R2=0.20, P=0.047). Study subjects were protocol-compliant (average adherence was >85%) and generally well-tolerated the L-carnitine therapy given. L-carnitine therapy (50 mg\/kilogram-bodyweight\/day) administered for 3-months significantly improved several clinical measurements of ASD severity, but subsequent studies are recommended.","170":"The purpose of this study was to conduct a 20-week controlled trial of lovastatin (10 to 40\u2009mg\/day) in youth with fragile X syndrome (FXS) ages 10 to 17\u2009years, combined with an open-label treatment of a parent-implemented language intervention (PILI), delivered via distance video teleconferencing to both treatment groups, lovastatin and placebo. A randomized, double-blind trial was conducted at one site in the Sacramento, California, metropolitan area. Fourteen participants were assigned to the lovastatin group; two participants terminated early from the study. Sixteen participants were assigned to the placebo group. Lovastatin or placebo was administered orally in a capsule form, starting at 10\u2009mg and increasing weekly or as tolerated by 10\u2009mg increments, up to a maximum dose of 40\u2009mg daily. A PILI was delivered to both groups for 12\u2009weeks, with 4 activities per week, through video teleconferencing by an American Speech-Language Association-certified Speech-Language Pathologist, in collaboration with a Board-Certified Behavior Analyst. Parents were taught to use a set of language facilitation strategies while interacting with their children during a shared storytelling activity. The main outcome measures included absolute change from baseline to final visit in the means for youth total number of story-related utterances, youth number of different word roots, and parent total number of story-related utterances. Significant increases in all primary outcome measures were observed in both treatment groups. Significant improvements were also observed in parent reports of the severity of spoken language and social impairments in both treatment groups. In all cases, the amount of change observed did not differ across the two treatment groups. Although gains in parental use of the PILI-targeted intervention strategies were observed in both treatment groups, parental use of the PILI strategies was correlated with youth gains in the placebo group and not in the lovastatin group. Participants in both groups demonstrated significant changes in the primary outcome measures. The magnitude of change observed across the two groups was comparable, providing additional support for the efficacy of the use of PILI in youth with FXS.

The moderating effects of these bridge symptoms on the response to flexibly dosed lurasidone 20-80 mg\/d compared to placebo treatment was analyzed in children and adolescents with bipolar I depression in a six-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind study followed by a 2-year, openlabel extension study of lurasidone. Sleep disturbances, assessed by \"difficulty with sleep\" (Children's Depression Rating Scale, Revised [CDRS-R] item 4) and \"decreased need for sleep\" (Young Mania Rating Scale [YMRS] item 4), and \"irritability\" (CDRS-R item-8, YMRS item 5) were identified as \"bridge\" symptoms and found to have replicable causal associations with depressive (CDRS-R total) and manic symptom clusters (YMRS total) at baseline and week-6. A greater improvement in overall depression severity at week 6 with lurasidone (vs. placebo) treatment was observed in the presence (vs. absence) of decreased need for sleep at study baseline, mediated in part by significant reductions from study baseline in decreased need for sleep and manic symptom severity. The absence of sleep disturbance and irritability in patients at open-label extension study baseline was associated with higher rates of sustained recovery (symptomatic and functional remission) over 6 months compared to patients with those symptoms at baseline (68% vs. 50%, Number Needed to Treat=6). Our findings suggest that sleep disturbance and irritability are cardinal symptoms that \"bridge\" between depressive and manic symptom clusters and influence treatment outcomes in youth with bipolar depression.","173":"Drug trials for negative symptoms in schizophrenia select patients based on the severity and stability of negative symptoms, using criteria that are not suitable for trials of acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. Here we present a method to prognostically enrich subjects having a predefined factor structure in PANSS and apply it to the measurement of negative symptoms specifically in trials of acute schizophrenia. A vector of 1335 elements based on between- and within-item variances, covariances, and differences of PANSS items was created to calculate an index of heterogeneity and to enrich for a predetermined symptom construct in PANSS. Using prerandomization PANSS scores across <i>N<\/i> = 4876 subjects in 13 trials of acute schizophrenia, we demonstrate an ability to select for a subpopulation having the greatest amount of variance explained across the 7-items of the Marder PANSS negative symptom (MPNS) construct. Network analyses on subjects enriched for MPNS construct confirm that negative symptoms were most influential in overall psychopathology, distinct from subjects without the MPNS construct. As expected for D2 antagonists, drug-placebo differences on negative symptoms with lurasidone were not specific to the subpopulation having the MPNS construct. In contrast, the novel TAAR1 agonist ulotaront demonstrated specific improvements in negative symptoms which were greatest in the MPNS subpopulation. These results demonstrate the utility of a novel prognostic enrichment strategy that can address heterogeneity in clinical trials, where patients can be selected on the basis of a greater likelihood of having the measured symptom construct (negative symptoms) related to the disorder (schizophrenia).

A systematic literature review using PRISMA guidelines and network meta-analysis (NMA) of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of second-generation antipsychotics for bipolar depression in youths 10 to 18 years of age was conducted. Efficacy measures included Children's Depression Rating Scale, Revised (CDRS-R) and Clinical Global Impressions-Bipolar Disorder-Severity Depression (CGI-BP-S-depression) and Overall (CGI-BP-S-overall) scores. Available safety outcomes included discontinuations (all-cause, lack of efficacy, adverse events), metabolic parameters (weight change, cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose), changes in prolactin, and somnolence. Results from the NMA were reported as mean changes from baseline or odds ratios (OR) with 95% credible intervals (CrIs). Four RCTs comparing placebo to lurasidone, quetiapine (1 each for immediate- and extended-release), and the olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC) met\u00a0all of the inclusion criteria. Lurasidone and OFC demonstrated similar and statistically significant improvements in CDRS-R, but quetiapine did not (lurasidone:\u00a0-5.70 [-8.66,\u00a0-2.76]; OFC:\u00a0-5.01 [-8.63,\u00a0-1.38]; quetiapine:\u00a0-1.85 [-5.99, 2.27]). Lurasidone was associated with smaller changes in weight, cholesterol, and triglycerides from baseline compared to OFC and quetiapine. There were no differences in changes in glucose levels among antipsychotics. In addition, lurasidone was associated with smaller change in prolactin levels compared to OFC but not quetiapine. Evidence from 4 studies in this NMA indicated that lurasidone and OFC, but not quetiapine, were efficacious for the treatment of bipolar depression in youths. Lurasidone was associated with less weight gain and smaller impacts on cholesterol and triglycerides compared with quetiapine and OFC.","175":"While clinical trial evidence has firmly established the efficacy of several atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) for treating bipolar depression, no randomized controlled trials (RCT's) comparing AAPs have been conducted. This Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) compared the relative efficacy and tolerability of AAP monotherapy in adults with bipolar depression. Efficacy measures included change in Montgomery \u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Clinical Global Improvement - Bipolar Disorder (CGI-BP), response, and remission. Multiple tolerability outcomes were examined. Results from random effects models were reported as difference in change from baseline for continuous variables or odds ratios for dichotomous variables. Treatments were ranked using the surface under the curve cumulative ranking probabilities. Number needed to treat (NNT) and harm (NNH) were calculated. Eighteen RCT's met inclusion criteria of the systematic literature review. On change in MADRS, lurasidone (-\u20094.71 [95% Crl -\u20096.98, -\u20092.41]), quetiapine (-\u20094.80 [-\u20095.93, -\u20093.72]), olanzapine (-\u20094.57 [-\u20095.92, -\u20093.20]), and cariprazine (-\u20092.29 [-\u20093.47, -\u20091.09]) were more efficacious than placebo. Lurasidone was associated with a significantly greater odds of response (\u226550% improvement in MADRS) compared to cariprazine (1.78 [95% Crl 1.08, 2.77]), aripiprazole (2.38 [1.38, 3.85]), and ziprasidone (2.47 [1.41, 3.98]), but was similar to olanzapine (1.68 [0.99,2.65]) and quetiapine (1.25 [0.78, 1.90]). For change in CGI-BP-S-overall score, lurasidone was significantly better than cariprazine (-\u20090.38 [95% Crl -\u20090.66,-0.10]) and ziprasidone (-\u20090.58 [-\u20090.91,-0.26]), but similar to quetiapine (-\u20090.08 [-\u20090.36, 0.19])and olanzapine (-\u20090.04 [-\u20091.41, 1.46]). Lurasidone (0.34\u2009kg [95% Crl -\u20090.22, 0.89]) and aripiprazole (0.20\u2009kg [-\u20090.59, 1.00]) had a similar weight change compared to placebo, but olanzapine (2.88\u2009kg [2.40, 3.36]), quetiapine (1.17\u2009kg [0.84, 1.49]), and cariprazine (0.65\u2009kg [0.34, 0.96]) were associated with greater weight gain. The NNT for response was the lowest for lurasidone (NNT\u2009=\u20095) followed by quetiapine (NNT\u2009=\u20096), olanzapine (NNT\u2009=\u200910) and cariprazine (NNT\u2009=\u200912). In this NMA in adults with bipolar depression, which evaluated change in depressive symptoms (assessed by MADRS) across short-term trials, the largest improvement versus placebo was observed for lurasidone, olanzapine and quetiapine with cariprazine, showing a smaller treatment effect. Aripiprazole and ziprasidone were ineffective for the treatment of bipolar depression. Improvement in CGI-BP-S score for lurasidone was larger than cariprazine and ziprasidone but similar to quetiapine and olanzapine. Based on short term studies lurasidone and aripiprazole had similar weight gain compared to placebo.","176":"To compare the risk of hospitalization for adult Medicaid beneficiaries with bipolar I disorder treated with lurasidone vs. other oral atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) as monotherapy. A retrospective cohort study of the IBM MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid Claims database identified adults with bipolar I disorder who initiated an AAP (index date) between 1 January 2014 and 30 June 2019. Patients were continuously enrolled 12\u2009months pre- and 24\u2009months post-index date. Each month during the post-index period was categorized as monotherapy with lurasidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine or risperidone, no\/minimal treatment, or other. Marginal structural models were performed to estimate hospitalization risk and length of stay (LOS) (all-cause and bipolar I disorder-related) compared to lurasidone. The analysis included 8262 adults. Compared to lurasidone, the adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of all-cause hospitalization were significantly higher for olanzapine (aOR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.09-2.10) and quetiapine (aOR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.18-1.89). The risk was significantly higher for bipolar I disorder-related hospitalization for quetiapine (aOR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.10-2.04) and risperidone (aOR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.04-2.56) compared to lurasidone. The bipolar I disorder-related LOS per 100 patient-months was more than twice as long for quetiapine (8.42\u2009days) compared to lurasidone (3.97\u2009days, <i>p<\/i>\u2009<\u2009.01). Lurasidone-treated adult Medicaid patients with bipolar I disorder had significantly lower risk of all-cause hospitalization than those treated with olanzapine and quetiapine and lower risk of bipolar I disorder-related hospitalization than quetiapine and risperidone. Bipolar I disorder-related hospital LOS was significantly shorter for patients treated with lurasidone compared to quetiapine.","177":"To compare healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), costs, and treatment adherence and persistence for patients with bipolar disorder treated with lurasidone or cariprazine. Adult patients with bipolar disorder who initiated lurasidone or cariprazine as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy between 1 January 2016 and 30 June 2019 were identified from the IBM MarketScan Commercial and Medicare Supplemental Database. The date of the first claim for lurasidone or cariprazine was defined as the index date. A difference-in-difference (DID) analysis, which mitigated bias by using each cohort as its own control, compared the changes in HCRU and costs from 6-months pre-treatment (baseline) to 6-months post-treatment (follow-up) between the two cohorts. Treatment adherence (medication possession ratio and proportion of days covered) and persistence (time to discontinuation) were assessed during the 6-month post-treatment period. Adjusted analyses were conducted using inverse probability of treatment weighting on HCRU, costs, and time to discontinuation. A total of 16,683 patients treated with lurasidone and 4,128 patients treated with cariprazine were identified. Average age (39-40) and proportion female (68-71%) were similar between cohorts. Both cohorts had reductions in hospitalizations from baseline to follow-up, and the decrease was significantly greater for the lurasidone cohort compared to the cariprazine cohort (change in the proportions of patients with all-cause hospitalizations: -5.3% vs. -2.5%, DID\u2009=\u2009-2.8%, <i>p<\/i><.001). The total healthcare costs increased from baseline to follow-up in both cohorts, and the increase was significantly lower for the lurasidone cohort (change in total all-cause healthcare cost per person: $3,413 vs. $4,642, DID=-$1,228, <i>p<\/i>\u2009=\u2009.022). The lurasidone cohort had significantly lower risk of discontinuing treatment (hazard ratio = 0.86, <i>p<\/i><.001) than the cariprazine cohort. Patients with bipolar disorder treated with lurasidone had greater reductions in hospitalizations from 6-months pre-treatment to 6-months post-treatment and had a lower increase in total costs compared to patients treated with cariprazine.","178":"To investigate the symptom network structure of major depressive disorder (MDD) with mixed features and implications for treatment. In this post-hoc analysis of a previously reported randomized trial, patients meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for MDD presenting with two or three manic symptoms (DSM-5 mixed features specifier) were randomized to 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with lurasidone 20-60\u00a0mg\/d (N\u00a0=\u00a0109) or placebo (N\u00a0=\u00a0100). The network structure of symptoms at baseline and their treatment moderating effects were investigated. Network analyses showed that both ``elevated mood'' (YMRS item 1) and ``increased motor activity-energy'' (YMRS item 2) were associated with ``sleep disturbance'' (\"bridge\" symptom) and the depressive symptom cluster. Presence of both \"elevated mood\" and \"increased motor activity-energy\" at baseline predicted significantly less improvement in MADRS and CGI-S score at week 6 with lurasidone (vs. placebo) compared to patients without these manic symptoms at baseline. The network model also showed \"rapid\/pressured speech\" (YMRS item 6) at baseline predicted improvement in both manic and depressive symptoms with lurasidone vs. placebo treatment. This was a post-hoc analysis where findings need to be confirmed by prospective controlled studies. This post-hoc analysis describes the symptom network structure of MDD with mixed features in a patient sample at study baseline. Specific manic symptoms were found to be linked to sleep disturbance (characterized as a \"bridge\" symptom), which in turn linked the manic and depressive symptom clusters. The presence (vs. absence) of the specific manic symptoms we identified moderated the antidepressant and antimanic effects of lurasidone in the treatment of MDD with mixed (subthreshold hypomanic) features.","179":"To assess the effects of treatment with lurasidone on risk for metabolic syndrome (MetS) in patients with schizophrenia. Rates of metabolic syndrome during treatment with lurasidone (40-160\u00a0mg\/d) were analyzed using pooled, short-term data from three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (vs olanzapine and quetiapine XR); long-term data from two active-comparator-controlled studies (vs risperidone and quetiapine XR); and data from two open-label studies in which patients were switched from olanzapine or risperidone to lurasidone. MetS was defined based on the National Cholesterol Education Program criteria. In short-term studies, the odds of meeting criteria for MetS at week 6 LOCF (adjusted for baseline metabolic syndrome status) was similar for the lurasidone and placebo groups (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.18; [95% CI, 0.81-1.71]; P\u00a0=\u00a0.39), but the odds (vs placebo) were significantly greater for olanzapine (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.81; [95% CI, 1.53-5.15]; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and quetiapine (OR\u00a0=\u00a03.49; [95% CI, 1.93-6.29]; P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). No dose effect was observed for lurasidone across the dose range of 40-160\u00a0mg\/d. In long-term studies, the odds of MetS after 12\u00a0months of treatment was significantly higher for risperidone compared with lurasidone (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.12; 95% CI, 1.15-3.90; P\u00a0=\u00a0.016) and for quetiapine XR compared with lurasidone (OR\u00a0=\u00a03.92; 95% CI, 1.15-13.40; P\u00a0=\u00a0.029). In open-label extension studies, the rate of MetS decreased in patients switched to lurasidone after 6\u00a0weeks of treatment with olanzapine or 12\u00a0months of treatment with risperidone. In this analysis of lurasidone clinical trials, the odds of developing metabolic syndrome were minimal during short- and long-term treatment with lurasidone (40-160\u00a0mg\/d).","180":"Accumulating evidence has implicated insulin resistance and inflammation in the pathophysiology of cognitive impairments associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. This post-hoc analysis based on a placebo-controlled trial investigated the effect of inflammation (indexed by CRP) and metabolic risk factors on cognitive performance in patients with schizophrenia treated with lurasidone. Acutely exacerbated patients with schizophrenia were randomized to lurasidone (80 or 160\u00a0mg\/day), quetiapine XR 600\u00a0mg\/day, or placebo. A wide range CRP test and a cognitive assessment using the CogState computerized battery were performed at baseline and week 6 study endpoint. Associations between log-transformed CRP, high density lipoprotein (HDL), homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and treatment response were evaluated. CRP combined with HDL, triglyceride-to-HDL (TG\/HDL) ratio, or HOMA-IR at study baseline were significant moderators of the improvement in cognitive performance associated with lurasidone 160\u00a0mg\/day (vs. placebo) treatment (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Greater placebo-corrected treatment effect size on the CogState composite score was observed for patients in the lurasidone 160\u00a0mg\/day treatment group who had either low CRP and high HDL (d\u00a0=\u00a00.43), or low CRP and low HOMA-IR (d\u00a0=\u00a00.46). Interactive relationships between CRP, HDL, TG\/HDL, HOMA-IR and the antipsychotic efficacy of lurasidone or quetiapine XR were not significant. There were no significant associations between antipsychotic treatment and changes in CRP level at study endpoint. Findings of this post-hoc analysis based on a placebo-controlled trial in patients with schizophrenia suggest that baseline CRP level combined with measures of metabolic risk significantly moderated the improvement in cognitive performance associated with lurasidone 160 mg\/day (vs. placebo) treatment.\u00a0Our findings underscore the importance of maintaining a low metabolic risk profile in patients with schizophrenia.","181":"To explore possible benefits of a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agent for autistic symptoms based on postmortem observation of nAChR abnormalities (deficient \u03b14\u03b22 nAChRs, excess \u03b17 nAChRs) in brains of patients with autism. Mecamylamine, because of its safety record in children with other disorders, was chosen for this first exploration. Twenty children with autism spectrum disorder age 4-12 years were randomly assigned for 14 weeks to placebo (n=8) or mecamylamine (n=12) in ascending fixed doses: 0.5 mg\/day for 6 weeks, 2.5 mg for 2 weeks, then 5 mg\/day for 6 weeks. Improvement was rated by a blinded independent evaluator. Because of small sample, data analysis was descriptive. Eighteen participants (10 mecamylamine, 8 placebo) completed the study. All doses were well tolerated; the only side effect of note was constipation (50% compared with 25% of placebo group). Three children had clinically nonsignificant electrocardiographic QT prolongation. Both groups showed modest to moderate improvement, but differences between groups were negligible. On the primary outcome measure, the Ohio Autism Clinical Impressions Scale, 90% of the active treatment group showed improvement at some point (but only 40% sustained it), compared with 62% on placebo. Of the four in active treatment that sustained improvement, three had a maximum dose of 0.13-0.15 mg\/kg\/day, while those who regressed had doses \u22650.18 mg\/kg\/day. Graphed means suggested better outcome with lower mg\/kg and longer medication duration. Four parents spontaneously reported reduced hyperactivity and irritability and better verbalization and continued mecamylamine at their own expense. Mecamylamine appeared to be safe, but not very effective in autism. The suggestion of better results at lower doses and longer exposure warrants consideration for future trials. The next step would be exploration of a more specific \u03b14\u03b22 nAChR agonist, such as varenicline.","182":"Robust clinical evidence has not been available for melatonin, a drug commonly administered for treating sleep problems of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In a phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, we administered 1-mg melatonin (n\u2009=\u200965), 4-mg melatonin (n\u2009=\u200965), or placebo (n\u2009=\u200966) to196 children with ASD once daily before bedtime under adequate sleep hygiene interventions. The primary outcome was sleep onset latency (SOL) assessed with the electronic sleep diary. SOL shortened significantly in the 1- and 4-mg melatonin groups compared to the placebo group (-\u00a022.0, -\u00a028.0, and -\u00a05.0\u00a0min, respectively; p\u2009<\u20090.0001 each). This therapeutic regimen of melatonin is a reasonable clinical approach to cope with ASD-emergent difficulties in children with ASD.","183":"Clinical evidence is required about the long-term efficacy and safety of melatonin treatment for sleep problems in children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) who underwent adequate sleep hygiene interventions. We conducted a 26-week, multicenter, collaborative, uncontrolled, open-label, phase III clinical trial of melatonin granules in children 6 to 15\u2009years of age who had NDDs and sleep problems. The study consisted of the 2-week screening phase, the 26-week medication phases I and II, and the 2-week follow-up phase. Children received 1, 2, or 4\u2009mg melatonin granules orally in the medication phases. Variables of sleep status including sleep onset latency (SOL), aberrant behaviors listed on the Aberrant Behavior Check List-Japanese version (ABC-J), and safety were examined. The primary endpoint was SOL in the medication phase I. Between June 2016 and July 2018, 99 children (80 males and 19 females, 10.4\u2009years in mean age) were enrolled at 17 medical institutions in Japan-74, 60, 22, 9, 6, and 1 of whom had autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder, intellectual disabilities, motor disorders, specific learning disorder, and communication disorders, respectively, at baseline. Fifteen children received the maximal dose of 4\u2009mg among the prespecified dose levels.

Temper upon wakening and sleepiness after awakening improved significantly (P\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.0001 each) in the medication phase I from baseline and persisted in the follow-up phase. The following subscales of the ABC-J improved significantly: stereotypic behavior (P\u2009=\u20090.0322) in the medication phase I; and irritability, hyperactivity, and inappropriate speech (P\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.0001) in the medication phase II. Treatment-emergent adverse events did not occur subsequent to week 16 after medication onset, and NDDs did not deteriorate in the follow-up phase. Long-term melatonin treatment in combination with adequate sleep hygiene interventions may afford clinical benefits to children with NDDs and potentially elevates their well-being.

Herein we confirmed the diurnal variation of melatonin metabolites, oxidative stress markers, and antioxidant power in urine of patients with XPA and age-matched controls, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The peak of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin, a metabolite of melatonin, was seen at 6:00 in both the XPA patients and controls, though the peak value is lower, specifically in the younger age group of XPA patients. The older XPA patients demonstrated an increase in the urinary levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and hexanoyl-lysine, a marker of oxidative DNA damage and lipid peroxidation, having a robust peak at 6:00 and 18:00, respectively. In addition, the urinary level of total antioxidant power was decreased in the older XPA patients. Recently, it is speculated that oxidative stress and antioxidant properties may have a diurnal variation, and the circadian rhythm is likely to influence the NER itself. We believe that the administration of melatonin has the possibility of ameliorating the augmented oxidative stress in neurodegeneration, especially in the older XPA patients, modulating the melatonin metabolism and the circadian rhythm.","185":"We carried out a questionnaire survey to investigate the uses of melatonin and ramelteon in Japanese children. We sent a questionnaire to councilors of the Japanese Society of Child Neurology by e-mail, and sent the same questionnaire to members of the Japanese Society of Pediatric Psychiatry and Neurology by postal mail. During the first phase of the survey, 220 responses were obtained, and 45% of the respondents prescribed melatonin. Imported supplements and chemical reagents were used by 64% and 29% of melatonin prescribers, respectively. Some prescribed melatonin without patient consent or institutional approval. In patients with pervasive developmental disorder, cerebral palsy, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, Rett syndrome, and visual disturbance, melatonin was prescribed by 37%, 29%, 10%, 6%, and 6% of the respondents, respectively. In terms of sleep disorders, melatonin was prescribed by 49% and 42% of respondents in patients with circadian rhythm disorders and insomnia, respectively. Ramelteon was prescribed by 52% of respondents. Regarding types of target diseases and sleep disorders, the use of ramelteon differed little from that of melatonin. In the second phase of the survey on the use of melatonin, 23 doctors prescribed the drug for 254 patients. The daily effective dose ranged from 0.2 mg to 8 mg in patients aged 2 months to 37 years. In more than 60% of the patients who took melatonin, PDD was diagnosed. In the patients with melatonin for insomnia, 90% and 25% had difficulty falling asleep and disorders in circadian rhythm, respectively. Both melatonin and ramelteon were widely prescribedin Japanese children. Melatonin tended to be used without sufficient ethical consideration in Japan, indicating the necessity of melatonin as medicine. Then, careful determination of an applicable dose are required in future studies.","186":"Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a genetic disorder caused by deficient nucleotide excision repair. Patients with CS exhibit progeroid features, developmental delay, and various neurological disorders; they are also known to suffer from sleep problems, which have never been investigated in detail. The aim of this study is to investigate the pathogenesis of sleep disorders in patients with CS. We performed a questionnaire survey of the families of patients with CS, enzyme-linked immunosorbent analyses of the melatonin metabolite, 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (6-SM), in the patients' urine, and immunohistochemistry in the hypothalamus, the basal nucleus of Meynert (NbM), and the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPN) in four autopsy cases. Sleep-wakefulness rhythms were disturbed in patients with CS, and these disturbances seemed to be related to a reduced urinary excretion of 6-SM. In addition, although the hypothalamic nuclei were comparatively preserved, acetylcholine neurons (AchNs) were severely decreased in the NbM and PPN. AchNs modulate both arousal and rapid eye movement sleep, and selective lesions of AchNs in the PPN and\/or NbM in combination with disturbed melatonin metabolism might be involved in the sleep disorders in CS.","187":"Melatonin's potential preventive effect against cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains hypothetical. No study has evaluated the relationships between endogenous melatonin and the established blood biomarkers related to CVD. The objective of the present study is to examine the association between the endogenous melatonin level and various established blood biomarkers of risk of CVD, including white blood cell (WBC) count and plasma concentrations of lipids, homocysteine, uric acid (UA), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). This cross-sectional study included 181 Japanese women who attended a health checkup program provided by a general hospital between March 2005 and March 2006. All study subjects responded to a self-administered questionnaire and were measured for weight, height, and blood pressure. Venous fasting blood and first-void morning urine were obtained from all subjects. Statistically significant inverse correlations were observed between urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s), the major metabolite of melatonin in urine, and WBC count, UA, and hs-CRP after controlling for age, body mass index, menopausal status, smoking status, diet, sleeping habits, and exercise (r = -0.19, -0.21, and -0.24, respectively). There were no significant correlations between urinary aMT6s and plasma lipids and homocysteine. These data suggested that the urinary aMT6s level was inversely associated with established independent risk factors for CVD, such as WBC, UA, and hs-CRP. Endogenous melatonin may have implications for the risk of CVD.","188":"A vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT) is responsible for the accumulation of l-glutamate in synaptic vesicles in glutamatergic neurons. Two isoforms, VGLUT1 and VGLUT2, have been identified, which are complementarily expressed in these neurons. Mammalian pinealocytes, endocrine cells for melatonin, are also glutamatergic in nature, accumulate l-glutamate in synaptic-like microvesicles (SLMVs), and secrete it through exocytosis. Although the storage of l-glutamate in SLMVs is mediated through a VGLUT, the molecular nature of the transporter is less understood. We recently observed that VGLUT2 is expressed in pinealocytes. In the present study, we show that pinealocytes also express VGLUT1. RT-PCR and northern blot analyses indicated expression of the VGLUT1 gene in pineal gland. Western blotting with specific antibodies against VGLUT1 indicated the presence of VGLUT1 in pineal gland. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with a section of pineal gland and cultured cells indicated that VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 are co-localized with process terminal regions of pinealocytes. Furthermore, immunoelectronmicroscopy as well as subcellular fractionation studies revealed that both VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 are specifically associated with SLMVs. These results indicate that both VGLUTs are responsible for storage of l-glutamate in SLMVs in pinealocytes. Pinealocytes are the first exception as to complementary expression of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2.","189":"5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is a precursor and a putative modulator for melatonin synthesis in mammalian pinealocytes. 5-HT is present in organelles distinct from l-glutamate-containing synaptic-like microvesicles as well as in the cytoplasm of pinealocytes, and is secreted upon stimulation by norepinephrine (NE) to enhance serotonin N-acetyltransferase activity via the 5-HT2 receptor. However, the mechanism underlying the secretion of 5-HT from pinealocytes is unknown. In this study, we show that NE-evoked release of 5-HT is largely dependent on Ca2+ in rat pinealocytes in culture. Omission of Ca2+ from the medium and incubation of pineal cells with EGTA-tetraacetoxymethyl-ester inhibited by 59 and 97% the NE-evoked 5-HT release, respectively. Phenylephrine also triggered the Ca2+-dependent release of 5-HT, which was blocked by phentolamine, an alpha antagonist, but not by propranolol, a beta antagonist. Botulinum neurotoxin type E cleaved 25 kDa synaptosomal-associated protein and inhibited by 50% of the NE-evoked 5-HT release. Bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of vacuolar H+-ATPase, and reserpine and tetrabenazine, inhibitors of vesicular monoamine transporter, all decreased the storage of vesicular 5-HT followed by inhibition of the NE-evoked 5-HT release. Agents that trigger L-glutamte exocytosis such as acetylcholine did not trigger any Ca2+-dependent 5-HT release. Vice versa neither NE nor phenylephrine caused synaptic-like microvesicle-mediated l-glutamate exocytosis. These results indicated that upon stimulation of a adrenoceptors pinealocytes secrete 5-HT through a Ca2+-dependent exocytotic mechanism, which is distinct from the exocytosis of synaptic-like microvesicles.","190":"The mammalian pineal gland uses L-glutamate as an intercellular chemical transmitter to regulate negatively melatonin synthesis. To receive glutamate signals, pinealocytes express at least three kinds of glutamate receptors: metabotropic receptor types 3 and 5 and an ionotropic receptor, GluR1. In this study, we examined whether or not the fourth class of ionotropic receptor, delta, which is known for its nondefinitive molecular function and its unique expression pattern in brain, is expressed in pineal gland. RT-PCR analyses with specific probes indicated the expression of mRNA of delta2 but not that of delta1 in pineal gland and cultured pineal cells. Western blotting analysis with polyclonal antibodies specific to the carboxyl-terminal region of the delta2 receptor recognized a single 110-kDa polypeptide of cerebellar membranes and specifically immunostained Purkinje cells. The delta2 antibodies recognized a 110-kDa polypeptide of pineal membranes and specifically immunostained huge glial-like cells with the occasional presence of several long, branching processes in a pineal cell culture. delta2 is not uniformly distributed throughout the cells and is relatively abundant at the periphery of the cell bodies and long processes, where the terminals of synaptophysin-positive processes of pinealocytes, a site for glutamate secretion, are frequently present. The delta2-positive cells constitute a very minor population among total pineal cells (approximately 0.03%). Double immunolabeling with delta2 antibodies and antibodies against marker proteins for pineal interstitial cells clearly distinguishes delta2-positive pineal cells and other known interstitial cells, including glial fibrillary acidic protein- or vimentin-positive glial-like cells. These results indicated that the delta2 glutamate receptor is expressed in a novel subpopulation of pineal glial-like cells in culture and suggest the presence of a glutamate-mediated intercellular signal transduction mechanism between pinealocytes and delta2-expressing cells. The pineal cells may provide a good experimental system for studies on the function of glutamate receptor delta2.","191":"Rat pinealocytes receive noradrenergic innervation that stimulates melatonin synthesis. Besides melatonin, we showed previously that pinealocytes accumulate L-glutamate in microvesicles and secrete it through an exocytic mechanism. The secreted glutamate binds to the class II metabotropic glutamate receptor and inhibits norepinephrine-stimulated melatonin synthesis in neighboring pinealocytes through an inhibitory cyclic AMP cascade. In this study, it was found that, in addition to metabotropic receptors, pinealocytes express functional ionotropic receptors. RT-PCR and northern analyses indicated the expression of mRNA for GluR1, KA2, and NR2C in pineal gland. The presence of GluR1 protein was confirmed by immunological techniques, but neither KA2 nor NR2C was detected. Consistent with this observation, the presence of (RS)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid or kainate, non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonists, transiently stimulated increased the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration of cultured pinealocytes, whereas N-methyl-D-aspartate did not. These responses were prevented by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, a selective antagonist for non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, by L-type Ca(2+) channel blockers such as nifedipine, or by omitting Ca(2+) or Na(+) in the medium. In the presence of Ca(2+) and Na(+), (RS)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid or kainate evoked glutamate secretion from the cultured cells, which was prevented by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, L-type Ca(2+) channel blockers, type E or B botulinum neurotoxin, or incubation at <20 degrees C. These results strongly suggest that GluR1 is functionally expressed in pinealocytes and triggers microvesicle-mediated exocytosis of L-glutamate via activation of L-type Ca(2+) channels. It is possible that GluR1 participates in a signaling cascade that enhances and expands the L-glutamate signal throughout the pineal gland.","192":"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that causes significant impairment in socialization and communication. It is also associated with ritualistic and stereotypical behaviour. Recent studies propose both hyper-and hypoglutamatergic ideologies for autism. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of memantine plus risperidone in the treatment of children with autism. Children with autism were randomly allocated to risperidone plus memantine or placebo plus risperidone for a 10-wk, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The dose of risperidone was titrated up to 3\u00a0mg\/d and memantine was titrated to 20\u00a0mg\/d. Children were assessed at baseline and after 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 wk of starting medication protocol. The primary outcome measure was the irritability subscale of Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C). Difference between the two treatment arms was significant as the group that received memantine had greater reduction in ABC-C subscale scores for irritability, stereotypic behaviour and hyperactivity. Eight side-effects were observed over the trial, out of the 25 side-effects that the checklist included. The difference between the two groups in the frequency of side-effects was not significant. The present study suggests that memantine may be a potential adjunctive treatment strategy for autism and it was generally well tolerated. This trial is registered with the Iranian Clinical Trials Registry (IRCT1138901151556N10; www.irct.ir).","193":"Three phase 2 trials were conducted to assess the efficacy and long-term safety of weight-based memantine extended release (ER) treatment in children with autism spectrum disorder. MEM-MD-91, a 50-week open-label trial, identified memantine extended-release treatment responders for enrollment into MEM-MD-68, a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled withdrawal trial. MEM-MD-69 was an open-label extension trial in which participants from MEM-MD-68, MEM-MD-91, and open-label trial MEM-MD-67 were treated \u2a7d48\u2009weeks with memantine extended release. In MEM-MD-91, 517 (59.6%) participants were confirmed Social Responsiveness Scale responders at week 12; mean Social Responsiveness Scale total raw scores improved two to three times a minimal clinically important difference of 10 points. In MEM-MD-68, there was no difference between memantine and placebo on the primary efficacy parameter, the proportion of patients with a loss of therapeutic response (defined as \u2a7e10-point increase from baseline in Social Responsiveness Scale total raw score). MEM-MD-69 exploratory analyses revealed mean standard deviation improvement in Social Responsiveness Scale total raw score of 32.4 (26.4) from baseline of the first lead-in study. No new safety concerns were evident. While the a priori-defined efficacy results of the double-blind trial were not achieved, the considerable improvements in mean Social Responsiveness Scale scores from baseline in the open-label trials were presumed to be clinically important.","194":"Abnormal glutamatergic neurotransmission is implicated in the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this study, the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist memantine (once-daily extended-release [ER]) were investigated in children with autism in a randomized, placebo-controlled, 12 week trial and a 48 week open-label extension. A total of 121 children 6-12 years of age with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed., Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR)-defined autistic disorder were randomized (1:1) to placebo or memantine ER for 12 weeks; 104 children entered the subsequent extension trial. Maximum memantine doses were determined by body weight and ranged from 3 to 15\u2009mg\/day. There was one serious adverse event (SAE) (affective disorder, with memantine) in the 12 week study and one SAE (lobar pneumonia) in the 48 week extension; both were deemed unrelated to treatment. Other AEs were considered mild or moderate and most were deemed not related to treatment. No clinically significant changes occurred in clinical laboratory values, vital signs, or electrocardiogram (ECG). There was no significant between-group difference on the primary efficacy outcome of caregiver\/parent ratings on the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), although an improvement over baseline at Week 12 was observed in both groups. A trend for improvement at the end of the 48 week extension was observed. No improvements in the active group were observed on any of the secondary end-points, with one communication measure showing significant worsening with memantine compared with placebo (p\u2009=\u20090.02) after 12 weeks. This trial did not demonstrate clinical efficacy of memantine ER in autism; however, the tolerability and safety data were reassuring. Our results could inform future trial design in this population and may facilitate the investigation of memantine ER for other clinical applications.","195":"This report examined the effect of methylphenidate on social communication and self-regulation in children with pervasive developmental disorders and hyperactivity in a secondary analysis of RUPP Autism Network data. Participants were 33 children (29 boys) between the ages of 5 and 13 years who participated in a four-week crossover trial of placebo and increasing doses of methylphenidate given in random order each for one week. Observational measures of certain aspects of children's social communication, self-regulation, and affective behavior were obtained each week. A significant positive effect of methylphenidate was seen on children's use of joint attention initiations, response to bids for joint attention, self-regulation, and regulated affective state. The results go beyond the recent literature and suggest that methylphenidate may have positive effects on social behaviors in children with PDD and hyperactivity.","196":"To examine the psychometric properties of the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scales (CYBOCS) modified for pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs). Raters from five Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology (RUPP) Autism Network were trained to reliability. The modified scale (CYBOCS-PDD), which contains only the five Compulsion severity items (range 0-20), was administered to 172 medication-free children (mean 8.2 +\/- 2.6 years) with PDD (autistic disorder, n = 152; Asperger's disorder, n = 6; PDD not otherwise specified, n = 14) participating in RUPP clinical trials. Reliability was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and internal consistency by Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Correlations with ratings of repetitive behavior and disruptive behavior were examined for validity. Eleven raters showed excellent reliability (ICC = 0.97). The mean CYBOCS score was 14.4 (+\/- 3.86) with excellent internal consistency (alpha = .85). Correlations with other measures of repetitive behavior ranged from r = 0.11 to r = 0.28 and were similar to correlations with measures of irritability (r = 0.24) and hyperactivity (r = 0.25). Children with higher scores on the CYBOCS-PDD had higher levels of maladaptive behaviors and lower adaptive functioning. The five-item CYBOCS-PDD is reliable, distinct from other measures of repetitive behavior, and sensitive to change.","197":"Thirteen children (ages 5.6 to 11.2 years) with autism and symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of methylphenidate (0.3 and 0.6 mg\/kg per dose). Eight subjects responded positively, based upon a minimum 50% decrease on the Conners Hyperactivity Index. Ratings of stereotypy and inappropriate speech, which are often associated with autistic core features, also decreased. However, no changes were found on the Child Autism Rating Scale, a global assessment of autistic symptomotology. Significant adverse side effects occurred in some children including social withdrawal and irritability, especially at the 0.6 mg\/kg dose. Results suggest that methylphenidate can be efficacious for children with autism and ADHD symptoms. However, this group of children seems to be particularly susceptible to adverse side effects.","198":"This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design study of the safety and efficacy of methylphenidate (MPH) in 11 preschool children (aged 4.0-5.11 years) with developmental disabilities and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). MPH doses of 0.3 and 0.6 mg\/kg per dose and a placebo were given. Drug response was evaluated via teacher-completed behavior checklists and clinic-based observations of activity level, attention, and compliance to adult requests. A side effects checklist was also completed by teachers and parents. Significant improvement on teacher ratings of hyperactivity and inattention as well as clinic-based observations of activity level and compliance were associated with MPH. Eight of 11 preschool children were medication responders (based on a minimum 40% decrease between placebo and one drug condition on either the teacher-rated Conners Hyperactivity Index or the Hyperactive-Distractible subscale of the Preschool Behavior Questionnaire). Five children exhibited significant adverse drug side effects such as severe social withdrawal, increased crying, and irritability, especially at the higher dose (0.6 mg\/kg). Results suggest that preschool children with developmental disabilities and ADHD respond to MPH at rates similar to those of school-age children with mental retardation and ADHD. However, this population appears to be especially susceptible to adverse drug side effects.","199":"Fifty-two children (ages 7 to 14 years) with moderate retardation to borderline intellectual functioning were recontacted 12 to 65 months following participation in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of methylphenidate (MPH). Sixty-nine percent of subjects continued to be prescribed medication for behavior control at follow-up. While 72% of the sample evidenced improvement, over two-thirds continued to be rated at or above the 98th percentile on the Hyperactivity Index of the Parent Conners. In fact, 22% of subjects had received inpatient psychiatric treatment between the time of the initial MPH trial and follow-up. Finally, subjects with high initial ratings on the Parent Conners Conduct Problems scale were more likely to be suspended from school or receive inpatient psychiatric treatment than subjects with low initial ratings. The results suggested that children with ADHD and mental retardation of borderline intellectual functioning continued to exhibit significant symptoms associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) at follow-up and that early conduct problems were predictive of continuing behavioral difficulties.","200":"The primary purpose of this study was to predict stimulant medication response among children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and mental retardation (MR). Forty-seven children with ADHD and MR (IQs of 48 to 77) served as subjects; ages ranged from 6.1 to 12.5 years. Subjects participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of two doses of methylphenidate (0.3 and 0.6 mg\/kg per dose) and a placebo. Data were collected in each child's weekday classroom and a Saturday laboratory classroom. Stepwise multiple regression analyses were used to predict drug responses in both settings. Higher parent ratings of impulsivity and activity level at baseline were associated with greater gains in weekday classroom dependent measures. Similarly, higher weekday teacher measures of activity level, impulsivity, inattention, and conduct problems at baseline were related to improvement on Saturday laboratory classroom dependent measures. Finally, gender, race, and socioeconomic status (SES) were found to be important predictors, with males, Caucasian subjects, and subjects from families of higher SES more likely to evidence clinical gains on a number of variables than other subjects. These results were generally consistent with research conducted among children with ADHD but without MR. However, factors such as race and conduct problems appear to have predictive utility specific to children with MR.","201":"Using a combination of an alternating treatment and double-blind placebo-controlled drug design, the independent and combined effects of two behavioral interventions and two doses of methylphenidate (MPH) in 3 children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and mental retardation (MR) were assessed. In this single subject design, 2 of the 3 subjects responded positively to medication as measured by increased on-task behavior. The first behavioral intervention, a token economy for on-task behavior, was ineffective for increasing either on-task behavior or work accuracy when combined with placebo. However, improvement in work accuracy was realized with implementation of a second behavioral intervention that specifically targeted accuracy independent of drug conditions. The current findings highlight both the positive effects and limitations of the two commonly used treatment modalities for ADHD. Future studies should continue to extend this area of investigative efforts to produce more data-based knowledge as to the appropriate doses of treatment, both pharmacological and behavioral, with children with both ADHD and mental retardation.","202":"Stimulant medication efficacy was evaluated in 14 children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and IQs of 48 to 74 in a double-blind crossover study of two methylphenidate doses and placebo. Dependent measures included behavioral ratings, work output, measures of learning, attention and impulsivity, and direct observation of peer social interactions. Nine children (64%) were methylphenidate-responders, based upon the Conners Hyperactivity Index. Significant gains in on-task behavior and attentional skills were noted with methylphenidate in comparison to placebo. No improvement on measures of learning or social interactions were observed. Results extend and replicate previous research conducted by the authors.","203":"The adverse side effects of methylphenidate were evaluated in 27 children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and IQs of 48 to 74 who participated in a double-blind study of two doses of methylphenidate and placebo. A checklist of 13 side effects, generated from the Physician's Desk Reference, was completed by teachers. Rates of irritability, anxiety, moodiness, and activity level decreased significantly when comparing the placebo with drug conditions. However, medication for six (22%) of the children was discontinued because of the appearance of motor tics (three children) and severe social withdrawal (two children), suggesting that mentally retarded children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may be at a greater risk for developing these side effects than the nonretarded population.","204":"Twelve children with IQ scores of 50 to 74 (educable mental retardation) who met rigorous diagnostic criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder participated in a double-blind crossover study of the efficacy of two doses of methylphenidate compared with placebo. Dependent measures included behavioral ratings, classroom work output, laboratory measures of attention and learning, and direct observations of social behavior. Improvement with medication on the Conners Hyperactivity Index was observed in 75% of subjects. Significant increases in work output, on-task behavior, and attentional skills were associated with methylphenidate. However, gains in measures of attention were not associated with improvement in learning, as measured by a paired associate learning task. Additionally, no significant increases in appropriate social interactions during free play were associated with methylphenidate. The results suggest that mentally retarded children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder respond to methylphenidate at similar rates and in similar domains to that of the nonretarded population.","205":"This study assessed the safety and efficacy of methylphenidate in children with seizures and attention-deficit disorder. Ten children, aged 6 years 10 months to 10 years 10 months, without seizures while receiving a single antiepileptic drug, were evaluated in a double-blind medication-placebo crossover study with methylphenidate hydrochloride was administered at 0.3 mg\/kg per dose and given at 8 AM and 12 PM on school days only. The use of methylphenidate was associated with statistically significant improvements on the Conners' Teacher Rating Scale and on the Finger Tapping Task and with trends toward improvement on the Matching Familiar Figures Test and Discriminant Reaction Time tests. No child had seizures during the study period nor subsequently for those who continued receiving psychostimulants. There were no significant changes of epileptiform features or back-ground activity on electroencephalograms and no alterations in antiepileptic drug levels. Methylphenidate may be a safe and effective treatment for certain children with seizures and concurrent attention-deficit disorder.","206":"<b><i>Objective:<\/i><\/b> To examine the effectiveness of four doses of psychostimulant medication, combining extended-release methylphenidate (ER-MPH) in the morning with immediate-release MPH (IR-MPH) in the afternoon, on cognitive task performance. <b><i>Method:<\/i><\/b> The sample comprised 24 children (19 boys and 5 girls) who met the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition Text Revision<\/i> (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) on the <i>Autism Diagnostic Interview-R<\/i> and the <i>Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule<\/i>, and had significant symptoms of attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

The sample comprised 24 children (19 boys; 5 girls) who met American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed. (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) on the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), and had significant symptoms of attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This sample consisted of elementary school-age, community-based children (mean chronological age=8.8 years, SD=1.7; mean intelligence quotient [IQ]=85; SD=16.8). Effects of four dose levels of MPH on parent and teacher behavioral ratings were investigated using a within-subject, crossover, placebo-controlled design. MPH treatment was associated with significant declines in hyperactive and impulsive behavior at both home and school. Parents noted significant declines in inattentive and oppositional behavior, and improvements in social skills. No exacerbation of stereotypies was noted, and side effects were similar to those seen in typically developing children with ADHD. Dose response was primarily linear in the dose range studied. The results of this study suggest that MPH formulations are efficacious and well-tolerated for children with ASD and significant ADHD symptoms.","208":"Individual variation in cognitive and behavioral response to methylphenidate (MPH) was investigated in children with mental retardation and attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder. Twenty-four children (mean age 10.9 years, SD = 2.4) participated in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial with 0.15-, 0.30-, and 0.60-mg\/kg b.i.d. doses of MPH. Parent and teacher behavioral ratings, as well as cognitive task performance, were assessed at each dose. Relative to placebo, most children with attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder and mental retardation showed some degree of behavioral and cognitive improvement with MPH treatment. However, fewer of these children made substantial gains (>30% improvement, relative to placebo) with MPH treatment. At the highest dose, 55% of the children showed substantial behavioral gains and 46% made substantial gains in cognitive task performance. However, there was substantial independence between changes in behavior and changes in cognitive performance. At the 0.60-mg\/kg MPH dose, more children showed substantial cognitive and behavioral gains than those who showed substantial declines in a ratio of more than 5:1. However, it may be prudent to assess cognitive change as well as behavioral effects because improvements in the former do not necessarily forecast improvements in the latter in children with attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder and mental retardation.","209":"Cognitive effects of stimulant medication were investigated in children with mental retardation (MR) and attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Performance on tasks tapping sustained attention, visual and auditory selective attention, inhibition, and immediate memory was assessed for 24 children (mean age 10.9 years) during a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover treatment trial with 0.15, 0.30, and 0.60 mg\/kg b.i.d. dosages of methylphenidate (MPH). Successively higher MPH doses were associated with consistent gains in cognitive task performance, with optimal performance noted at the highest dose. Analysis of dose-response curves revealed significant linear components of trend on measures tapping sustained attention, visual selective attention, auditory selective attention, as well as two tasks tapping inhibition\/impulsivity: delay of gratification and match-to-sample. No evidence of a curvilinear dose-response relationship emerged for any measure. Inattention and disinhibition\/impulsivity decline with MPH treatment in children with ADHD\/MR, and consistent with the Multimodal Treatment Study of ADHD, higher MPH doses are most effective. These findings also suggest that cognitive testing, together with behavioral and medical assessment, can be an effective tool in assessing stimulant response in children with ADHD\/MR.","210":"The effects of stimulant medication treatment were investigated in children with mental retardation (MR) and attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Parent and teacher behavioral ratings and reports of side effects were obtained for children (N = 24, mean age = 10.9 years, SD = 2.4) during a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover treatment trial with 0.15 mg\/kg, 0.30 mg\/kg, and 0.60 mg\/kg b.i.d. dosages of methylphenidate. The most significant improvements occurred at the 0.60 mg\/kg methylphenidate dose for teacher ratings of inattention (p =.024), hyperactivity (p <.001), aggression (p <.001), and asocial behavior (p =.009). No significant improvements, relative to placebo, occurred at the 0.15 mg\/kg dosage. Of interest, nearly all significant medication-related behavioral improvements were detected by teachers. However, parents were sensitive raters of side effects, noting more sleeping problems and loss of appetite at the 0.60 mg\/kg dose compared with placebo. These results suggest that symptoms of ADHD can be treated successfully in children with ADHD\/MR, and consistent with MTA study results, higher doses were most effective. Furthermore, these improvements were not accompanied by increases in symptoms such as staring, social withdrawal, or anxiety.","211":"This study investigated the utility of the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP), a computerized laboratory analog aggression measure. We measured the effects of methylphenidate (MPH) on aggressive responding in children with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), who had high ratings on the Child Behavior Checklist Aggression Factor (CBCL; Achenbach 1991). Results are reported for 6 subjects, ages 8-11 years. All were tested at baseline in an unmedicated condition, and after double-blind administration of placebo, 0.3 mg\/kg of MPH, and 0.6 mg\/kg of MPH. A main effect of decreased aggressive responding with MPH was found, with a dose-related change by repeated measures ANOVA (F = 6.59, df = 2.10, p = .014). Post-hoc analysis with the Tukey HSD indicated that only the 0.6 mg\/kg was significantly (p < .05) different than placebo. Implications for use of the PSAP in future investigations of medications in aggressive children are discussed.","212":"Response to atomoxetine, a nonstimulant norepinephrine-specific reuptake inhibitor, was compared with the effect of osmotic-release oral methylphenidate, a long-acting methylphenidate preparation, in patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In a large placebo-controlled, double-blind study, patients ages 6-16 with ADHD, any subtype, were randomly assigned to receive 0.8-1.8 mg\/kg per day of atomoxetine (N=222), 18-54 mg\/day of osmotically released methylphenidate (N=220), or placebo (N=74) for 6 weeks. The a priori specified primary analysis compared response (at least 40% decrease in ADHD Rating Scale total score) to osmotically released methylphenidate with response to atomoxetine and placebo. After 6 weeks, patients treated with methylphenidate were switched to atomoxetine under double-blind conditions. The response rates for both atomoxetine (45%) and methylphenidate (56%) were markedly superior to that for placebo (24%), but the response to osmotically released methylphenidate was superior to that for atomoxetine. Each medication was well tolerated, with completion rates and discontinuations for adverse events not significantly different from those for placebo. Of the 70 subjects who did not respond to methylphenidate, 30 (43%) subsequently responded to atomoxetine. Likewise, 29 (42%) of the 69 patients who did not respond to atomoxetine had previously responded to osmotically released methylphenidate. Response was significantly greater with osmotically released methylphenidate than with atomoxetine. One-third of patients who received methylphenidate followed by atomoxetine responded better to one or the other, suggesting that there may be preferential responders.","213":"The primary treatment for attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been psychostimulants. Recently developed nonpsychostimulant treatments have allowed certain patients to switch from a psychostimulant to a nonpsychostimulant. However, the outcomes of such switches have not been systematically studied. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess treatment tolerance and efficacy during a cross-taper transition from methylphenidate or amphetamine to atomoxetine among children and adolescents with ADHD. This pilot study was conducted in patients (aged 6-17 years) with incomplete responses (failure to obtain full reduction\/elimination of symptoms) or intolerance of adverse events (AEs) during psychostimulant treatment. Patients continued ongoing psychostimulant treatment during the first week of the study. Transition to atomoxetine began by administering atomoxetine 0.5 mg\/kg . d plus full-dose psychostimulant for 1 week, followed in the second week by 1.2 mg\/kg . d atomoxetine plus half-dose psychostimulant. Patients remained on 1.2 mg\/kg . d atomoxetine monotherapy for the remaining 5 weeks. This stepwise transition was enacted due to the difference in pharmacodynamics between the psychostimulants and atomoxetine. Applying a stepwise cross-titration allowed for better control of ADHD symptoms during the intervening period. Change in ADHD symptoms, as measured by the mean change in the Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-IV-Parent Version: Investigator-administered and -scored (ADHDRS-IV-Parent:Inv), was assessed from baseline to end point. Of the 62 subjects enrolled in the study, 39 (62.9%) were diagnosed as ADHD-combined type. Similar proportions were receiving methylphenidate (51.6%) and amphetamine (48.4%). Slightly more wished to switch due to inadequate response (53.2%) than intolerability (46.8%). Nine subjects discontinued at various times during the course of the study (patient or parent\/caregiver decision [4], AE [2], protocol violation [2], and lack of efficacy [1]). Mean (SD) ADHDRS-IV-Parent:Inv total scores (n = 59, last-observation-carried-forward) improved significantly from baseline (visit 2) to an end point (32.1 [10.5] vs 22.6 [14.0]; P < 0.001). Of the 58 subjects answering in the atomoxetine monotherapy phase, 38 (65.5%) reported a preference for atomoxetine treatment over their previous psychostimulant. Tolerability results were as follows: 26 (44.1%) of 59 patients reported >or=1 AE, the most common being somnolence (4 [6.8%]), fatigue (3 [5.1%]), decreased appetite (3 [5.1%]), cough (3 [5.1%]), headache (3 [5.1%]), and contact dermatitis (2 [3.4%]). No clinically severe AEs were reported. Both mean (SD) diastolic (2.4 [7.8] mm Hg; P = 0.031) and systolic (2.4 [7.9] mm Hg; P = 0.029) blood pressures increased significantly from baseline to end point. Electrocardiography revealed a significant increase in mean (SD) heart rate (9.2 [11.6] bpm; P < 0.001) and a corresponding decrease in mean (SD) RR interval (-77.8 [98.2] ms; P < 0.001). Statistically significant, but mild, increases in diastolic pressure and heart rate were observed. These children and adolescent patients were successfully switched from methylphenidate or amphetamine to atomoxetine treatment, with resulting improvement in ADHD symptom severity from baseline in this pilot study.","214":"The use of psychostimulants in autistic disorder has not received extensive evaluation. Furthermore, their use for the symptomatic control of autistic disorder has been felt to be contraindicated. This study investigates the use of methylphenidate (MPH) for the treatment of selected symptoms of autistic disorder. Ten children, ages 7-11, with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of autistic disorder participated in a double-blind crossover study using placebo and two MPH doses (10 mg or 20 mg bid). Subjects showed modest but statistically significant improvement on MPH over placebo. No significant side effects including worsening stereotypic movements occurred on either dose. Improvement in hyperactivity and lack of adverse effects suggest that MPH may be useful in the treatment of hyperactive autistic children.","215":null,"216":"The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has surged, with an estimated 1 in 36 eight-year-olds in the United States meeting criteria for ASD in 2020. Autistic individuals face elevated rates of co-occurring medical, psychiatric, and behavioral conditions compared to non-autistic individuals. The rising ASD-patient demand is increasingly outpacing the capacity of ASD-specialty clinics, resulting in urgent need for autism-competent providers in general practice settings. This work aims to empower healthcare providers, especially primary care providers (PCPs), with guidelines for the recognition and safe pharmacologic management of common co-occurring psychiatric and behavioral conditions in ASD. Lurie Center for Autism medical providers, who have extensive experience in ASD care, delineated approaches for recognition and pharmacological treatment of sleep disturbances, attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, depression, and irritability tailored to ASD patients. Pharmacological guidelines were iteratively refined until consensus was reached. Treatment differences relative to standard of care (SOC) of non-autistic individuals are noted. Key literature and clinical trial results were reviewed to supplement clinical experience. The pharmacological treatment pathways reflect how appropriate medication options for ASD patients can depend on many factors unique to the patient and can differ from established non-autistic SOC. Key takeaways include: For sleep disturbances in ASD, initial strategies align with non-autistic SOC, emphasizing sleep hygiene and melatonin use. First-line recommendations for treating ADHD, anxiety, and depression in ASD differ from non-autistic SOC; \u03b1<sub>2<\/sub>-adrenergic agonists are more suitable than stimulants for some ASD-ADHD patients, buspirone and mirtazapine are preferred to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for anxiety, and duloxetine, mirtazapine, bupropion, and vortioxetine are recommended ahead of SSRIs for depression. Addressing irritability in ASD requires interdisciplinary evaluation of contributing factors, and guanfacine, risperidone, or aripiprazole may be appropriate, depending on severity. Recognition and treatment of co-occurring psychiatric and behavioral conditions in autistic patients must account for differences in clinical presentation and medication effectiveness and tolerability. Drawing on evidence-based clinical insights, these guidelines seek to support PCPs in making informed decisions when prescribing medications for ASD patients with co-occurring psychiatric and behavioral conditions, ultimately enhancing access to timely, comprehensive care for all individuals with ASD.","217":"Depression impacts many individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), carrying increased risk of functional impairment, hospitalization, and suicide. Prescribing medication to target depression in patients with ASD occurs despite limited available systematic data describing medication management of depression in this population. The purpose of this study is to discover prescribing patterns for individuals with MDD and ASD during this time period (2004-2012) to inform current and future prescribing practices with historical data. Drawing from a large clinical database describing the prescribing practices in patients with ASD, we identified 166 individuals with ASD (mean age 14.5\u2009\u00b1\u20098.3 years old) who received medication targeting symptoms of depression. We report prescribing rates for specific drugs, drug treatment duration, and reasons for drug discontinuation when applicable. Sertraline, mirtazapine, and fluoxetine were the three most commonly prescribed medications to treat comorbid depression for this patient population. Among 241 drug starts, 123 (49%) drug treatments were continued at the final reviewed follow-up visit (average treatment duration of \u00b1\u20090.72 years). The most common reason for discontinuation across all medications prescribed was loss of or lack of effectiveness. This study raises concern that standard of care pharmacological treatments for depression in individuals with ASD may be less effective than in neurotypical populations. There remains a need to develop effective interventions for depression specifically tailored to the needs of individuals with ASD.","218":"This study was a 10-week double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial of mirtazapine for anxiety in youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Participants were ages 5 to 17 years with ASD and clinically significant anxiety (Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale [PARS] score \u226510). Thirty participants were randomized to mirtazapine (7.5-45\u2009mg\/day) or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. The co-primary outcome measures were the PARS and the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement subscale (CGI-I). Mirtazapine resulted in a statistically significant within group decrease in anxiety on the PARS (ES 1.76, p\u2009<\u20090.001). The improvement in PARS score for mirtazapine versus placebo was clinically meaningful but not statistically significant (ES\u2009=\u20090.63, p\u2009=\u20090.64). Forty-seven percent of participants assigned to mirtazapine (95% CI 22%: 74%) and 20% assigned to placebo (95% CI 2%: 60%) were rated \"much improved\" (CGI-I\u2009=\u20092) or \"very much improved\" (CGI-I\u2009=\u20091) for anxiety, p\u2009=\u20090.46. No statistically significant differences in mean 10-week changes between mirtazapine and placebo occurred on any outcome measure. There were no statistically significant differences in adverse effect frequency between mirtazapine and placebo. The results are consistent with mirtazapine's safety and tolerability and meet three of four pre-specified indicators of efficacy (statistically significant change in total PARS score for mirtazapine, numerically greater reduction in total PARS score for mirtazapine than placebo, numerically higher number of responders to mirtazapine than placebo, but not greater than 50% of participants receiving mirtazapine rated as responders). Implementation of a larger randomized controlled trial of mirtazapine for the treatment of anxiety in this population is supported.Clinical trial registration information: Mirtazapine Treatment of Anxiety in Children and Adolescents with Pervasive Developmental Disorders; https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov ; NCT01302964.","219":"This review outlines pharmacologic treatments for the behavioral symptoms associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in children, adolescents, and adults. Symptom domains include repetitive and stereotyped behaviors, irritability and aggression, hyperactivity and inattention, and social impairment. Medications covered include serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs), mirtazapine, antipsychotics, psychostimulants, atomoxetine, \u03b1-2 agonists, D-cycloserine, and memantine. Overall, SRIs are less efficacious and more poorly tolerated in children with ASDs than in adults. Antipsychotics are the most efficacious drugs for the treatment of irritability in ASDs, and may be useful in the treatment of other symptoms. Psychostimulants demonstrate some benefit for the treatment of hyperactivity and inattention in individuals with ASDs, but are less efficacious and associated with more adverse effects compared with individuals with ADHD. D-cycloserine and memantine appear helpful in the treatment of social impairment, although further research is needed.","220":"Autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) are pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs) frequently associated with behavioral symptoms that may require pharmacotherapy to manage. Behavioral symptoms in children with autism include interfering repetitive behaviors, irritability, and hyperactivity and inattention, among others. The psychotropic medications examined in this review include: serotonin reuptake inhibitors, typical and atypical antipsychotics, medications used to treat attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder, naltrexone, buspirone, divalproex sodium, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, memantine, mirtazapine, riluzole, pioglitazone, and topiramate. For the treatment of interfering repetitive behaviors, serotonin reuptake inhibitors demonstrate less efficacy and are more poorly tolerated in children with autism compared to adults. Antipsychotics are the most efficacious drugs for the treatment of irritability in children with autism and other PDDs. For the treatment of hyperactivity and inattention, psychostimulants demonstrate some benefit. However, they are overall less efficacious and cause more side effects in children with PDDs compared to typically developing children with attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder. Results from double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of these agents and others for the treatment of the behavioral symptom domains described above will be discussed in this review.","221":"Recently, the addition of drugs with prominent 5-HT(2) receptor antagonist properties (risperidone, olanzapine, mirtazapine, and mianserin) to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has been shown to enhance therapeutic responses in patients with major depression and treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). These 5-HT(2) antagonists may also be effective in ameliorating some symptoms associated with autism and other pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs). At the doses used, these drugs would be expected to saturate 5-HT(2A) receptors. These findings suggest that the simultaneous blockade of 5-HT(2A) receptors and activation of an unknown constellation of other 5-HT receptors indirectly as a result of 5-HT uptake inhibition might have greater therapeutic efficacy than either action alone. Animal studies have suggested that activation of 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors may counteract the effects of activating 5-HT(2A) receptors. Additional 5-HT receptors, such as the 5-HT(1B\/1D\/5\/7) receptors, may similarly counteract the effects of 5-HT(2A) receptor activation. These clinical and preclinical observations suggest that the combination of highly selective 5-HT(2A) antagonists and SSRIs, as well as strategies to combine high-potency 5-HT(2A) receptor and 5-HT transporter blockade in a single compound, offer the potential for therapeutic advances in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders.","222":"This review examines the most recent evidence for the pharmacologic management of severe maladaptive behaviors often observed in patients with autistic disorder. Although a multimodal approach is imperative in the management of autism, medications are frequently required for the individual to benefit from behavioral and educational interventions. Several classes of medications appear helpful in diminishing specific target symptoms and include the atypical antipsychotics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mirtazapine, mood stabilizers and alpha(2)-adrenergic agonists. Controlled research and longitudinal studies are needed to expand the knowledge base of these compounds as well as other medications under investigation. It is anticipated that future research regarding neuroimmunology, as well as the cholinergic and glutamatergic neurotransmitter systems, will contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiology of autistic disorder.","223":"Prior neuroimaging clinical trials investigating the neural effects of intranasal administration of the neuropeptide oxytocin demonstrated a key role of the amygdala in oxytocin's neuromodulatory effects. These studies mostly demonstrated the acute effects of single-dose administrations, examining task-dependent effects of oxytocin on brain activity elicited during explicit experimental tasks or stimuli presentations. The increased consideration of oxytocin as a potential ameliorating treatment in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) requires a better understanding of how multiple-dose oxytocin administration affects intrinsic, task-free, amygdala function. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with between-subject design, 38 adult men with ASD underwent resting-state fMRI scanning before and after oxytocin or placebo treatment. Effects were assessed either after a single-dose administration, consisting of 24 international units, or after multiple-dose treatment, consisting of 4 weeks of once-daily nasal spray administrations. Compared to placebo, oxytocin induced a decrease in intrinsic resting-state BOLD signal amplitudes of the bilateral amygdala (fractional amplitudes of low-frequency fluctuations) and modulated cross-frequency interactions between adjacent BOLD frequency components. The right amygdala showed a pattern of reduced cross-frequency harmonicity, while the left amygdala showed a relative increase in harmonic cross-frequency interactions after oxytocin treatment. Notably, the direction and magnitude of BOLD spectral changes induced after a single-dose were qualitatively similar to treatment effects induced after multiple-dose treatment. Furthermore, the identified spectral changes in amygdalar BOLD amplitude and cross-frequency harmonicity were associated with improved feelings of tension, reflecting oxytocin's anxiolytic, stress-reducing neuromodulatory role. The observed effects of oxytocin on amygdalar BOLD spectral characteristics and associated behaviors contribute to a deeper mechanistic understanding of the intrinsic, task-free neuromodulatory dynamics that underlie single- and multiple-dose oxytocin treatment in ASD.

In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, we investigated the effects of single-dose and multiple-dose IN-OT treatment (4 weeks of daily (24 IU) administrations) on brain activity related to processing emotional states. Thirty-eight adult men with ASD (aged between 18 and 35 years) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging of the posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTS) and amygdala regions while processing emotional states from point-light biological motion. In line with prior research, a single dose of IN-OT induced a reliable increase in pSTS brain activity during the processing of point-light biological motion, but no consistent long-term changes in pSTS activity were induced after the multiple-dose treatment. In terms of bilateral amygdala, the multiple-dose treatment induced a consistent attenuation in brain activity, which outlasted the period of actual administrations until four weeks and one year post-treatment. Critically, participants with stronger attenuations in amygdala-activity showed greater behavioral improvements, particularly in terms of self-reported feelings of avoidant attachment and social functioning. Together, these observations provide initial insights into the long-lasting neural consequences of chronic IN-OT use on amygdala functioning and provide first indications that the acute versus chronic effects of IN-OT administration may be qualitatively different. Larger studies are however warranted to further elucidate the long-term impact of IN-OT treatment on human neural substrates and its behavioral consequences.","225":"Intranasal administration of the neuropeptide oxytocin (IN-OT) is increasingly explored as a potential treatment for targeting the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To date, however, the impact of multiple-dose IN-OT treatment on human neural circuitry is largely unknown, and also the possibility that long-term IN-OT use may induce long-lasting neural adaptations remains unexplored. Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, between-subject design (including 38 adult men with ASD), this treatment-mechanism study showed that 4 weeks of daily oxytocin administration (24 IU\/day) significantly altered intrinsic (resting-state fMRI) functional connectivity of the amygdala to core regions of the \"social brain\" (particularly orbitofrontal cortex and superior temporal sulcus) up to 4 weeks and 1 year post treatment. The neural adaptations in functional coupling of the amygdala to the orbitofrontal cortex were associated with reduced feelings of avoidance toward others and-at the trend level-reduced repetitive behaviors. These observations contribute to a deeper mechanistic understanding of the neural substrates that underlie behavioral effects of multiple-dose IN-OT treatment, and provide initial insights into the long-lasting neural consequences of chronic IN-OT use on amygdala circuitry. Future studies are however warranted to further elucidate the long-term impact of IN-OT treatment on human neural circuitry and its behavioral consequences.","226":"Intranasal administration of the \"prosocial\" neuropeptide oxytocin is increasingly explored as a potential treatment for targeting the core characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, long-term follow-up studies, evaluating the possibility of long-lasting retention effects, are currently lacking. Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design, this pilot clinical trial explored the possibility of long-lasting behavioral effects of 4 weeks of intranasal oxytocin treatment (24 International Units once daily in the morning) in 40 adult men with ASD. To do so, self-report and informant-based questionnaires assessing core autism symptoms and characterizations of attachment were administered at baseline, immediately after 4 weeks of treatment (approximately 24 h after the last nasal spray administration), and at two follow-up sessions, 4 weeks and 1 year post-treatment. No treatment-specific effects were identified in the primary outcome assessing social symptoms (Social Responsiveness Scale, self- and informant-rated). In particular, with respect to self-reported social responsiveness, improvements were evident both in the oxytocin and in the placebo group, yielding no significant between-group difference (<i>p<\/i> = .37). Also informant-rated improvements in social responsiveness were not significantly larger in the oxytocin, compared to the placebo group (between-group difference: <i>p<\/i> = .19). Among the secondary outcome measures, treatment-specific improvements were identified in the Repetitive Behavior Scale and State Adult Attachment Measure, indicating reductions in self-reported repetitive behaviors (<i>p<\/i> = .04) and reduced feelings of avoidance toward others (<i>p<\/i> = .03) in the oxytocin group compared to the placebo group, up to 1 month and even 1 year post-treatment. Treatment-specific effects were also revealed in screenings of mood states (Profile of Mood States), indicating higher reports of \"vigor\" (feeling energetic, active, lively) in the oxytocin, compared to the placebo group (<i>p<\/i> = .03). While no treatment-specific improvements were evident in terms of core social symptoms, the current observations of long-term beneficial effects on repetitive behaviors and feelings of avoidance are promising and suggestive of a therapeutic potential of oxytocin treatment for ASD. However, given the exploratory nature of this pilot study, future studies are warranted to evaluate the long-term effects of OT administration further. The trial was registered with the European Clinical Trial Registry (Eudract 2014-000586-45) on January 22, 2014 (https:\/\/www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu\/ctr-search\/trial\/2014-000586-45\/BE).","227":"The neuropeptide 'oxytocin' (OT) is known to play a pivotal role in a variety of complex social behaviors by promoting a prosocial attitude and interpersonal bonding. Previous studies showed that a single-dose of exogenously administered OT can affect trust and feelings of attachment insecurity. With the present study, we explored the effects of two weeks of daily OT administration on measures of state and trait attachment using a double-blind between-subjects randomized placebo-controlled design. In 40 healthy young adult men state and trait attachment were assessed before and after two weeks of daily intranasal OT (24 IU) or placebo using the State Adult Attachment Scale and the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment. Mood, social responsiveness and quality of life were additionally assessed as secondary outcome measures. Reductions in attachment avoidance and increases in reports of attachment toward peers were reported after two weeks of OT treatment. Further, treatment-induced changes were most pronounced for participants with less secure attachment towards their peers. indicating that normal variance at baseline modulated treatment response. OT treatment was additionally associated with changes in mood, indicating decreases in feelings of tension and (tentatively) anger in the OT group, not in the placebo group. Further, at the end of the two-week trial, both treatment groups (OT, placebo) reported to experience an increase in social responsiveness and quality of life, but the effects were only specific to the OT-treatment in terms of reports on 'social motivation'. In summary, the observed improvements on state and trait dimensions of attachment after a multiple-dose treatment with OT provide further evidence in support of a pivotal role of OT in promoting the experience of attachment.","228":"<i>N<\/i>-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a novel therapeutic agent with multiple mechanisms of action in the central nervous system and a favourable side effect profile. Clinical evidence indicates that adjunctive NAC may reduce the severity of depressive symptoms in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD). A 12-week randomised controlled trial of 2,000 mg\/day adjunctive NAC for MDD found no significant improvement at the primary endpoint (week 12) but did see improvements at the post-discontinuation interview (week 16). Within the context of patient-centered treatment, mixed-methods qualitative analysis was also included to explore factors that may determine individual responses to adjunctive NAC treatment. These data were drawn, under blinded conditions, from clinician notes recorded in the case report form. Using the DSM-5 symptom profile for MDD as the initial framework, themes were developed and explored. Frequencies were compared between placebo and NAC groups. Per protocol analysis of individual themes across the six interviews revealed group differences in favour of NAC for overall depressive affect, optimism, relationships and reduced functional impairment. This study provides further evidence for the utility of the mixed methods approach complimenting the primary findings using traditional quantitative analyses, as well as being able to capture additional, often more subtle, evidence of individual symptom-level change that reflects improvement in functional abilities in response to NAC supplementation. The use of mixed methods to explore outcomes from psychiatric studies should be considered in future to work towards improved patient-centred care and both confirm quantitative findings and generate novel hypotheses.","229":"Clozapine is the most effective antipsychotic for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, yet a significant proportion of individuals on clozapine continue to experience disabling symptoms, despite being treated with an adequate dose. There is a need for adjunct treatments to augment clozapine, notably for negative and cognitive symptoms. One such potential agent is the glutathione precursor N-acetylcysteine (NAC). A randomized double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled trial for clozapine patients with enduring psychotic symptoms (n = 84) was undertaken to investigate the efficacy of adjunctive NAC (2 g daily) for negative symptoms, cognition and quality of life (QoL). Efficacy was assessed at 8, 24, and 52 weeks. NAC did not significantly improve negative symptoms (P = .62), overall cognition (P = .71) or quality of life (Manchester quality of life: P = .11; Assessment of quality of life: P = .57) at any time point over a 1-year period of treatment. There were no differences in reported side effects between the groups (P = .26). NAC did not significantly improve schizophrenia symptoms, cognition, or quality of life in treatment-resistant patients taking clozapine.

Exploration of participant's experience provides vital information to enhance statistical outcomes for novel therapy trials. This study used mixed-methods to explore participants' experience of a trial testing N -acetyl cysteine (NAC) and mitochondrially active nutraceuticals for BD depression. report forms from a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of BD depression (n = 148) were analysed using a pragmatic adaption of grounded theory and thematic analysis. Thematic analysis of 148 study participants indicated numerous changes in participant experience over time. For example, perceived environmental stressors reported by participants decreased over the trial in both treatment groups. Quantitative analysis of the themes revealed more positive theme reports in the combination treatment arm compared to the placebo arm and there were more negative themes identified in the placebo arm, compared to the NAC arm. This approach revealed additional results not elucidated in the primary quantitative analysis. This emphasises the value of mixed-methods research in capturing participants' experiences in RCTs and detecting possible latent benefits and risks. Such methods can detect latent target signals in novel therapy trials conducted in BD and generate novel hypotheses.","231":"Preliminary evidence has suggested that adjunctive N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant precursor to glutathione, may reduce symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). We conducted a 20-week, multi-site, randomized controlled trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of the adjunctive use of NAC in OCD. The study was a phase III, 20-week, double-blind, randomized controlled trial across multiple sites in Australia investigating 2\u00a0g to 4\u00a0g per day of NAC (titrated according to response) in 98 participants with DSM-5 diagnosed OCD. Data were analysed using linear mixed effects models for the 89 participants who attended at least one follow-up visit. A modified intention-to-treat analysis of the primary outcome found no evidence that NAC reduced symptoms of OCD measured on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, relative to placebo (mean difference at week 20\u00a0=\u00a00.53, 95% compatibility interval\u00a0=\u00a0-2.18, 3.23; p\u00a0=\u00a00.70; favouring placebo). There was also no evidence that NAC, compared to placebo, improved outcomes on the secondary measures including anxiety, depression, quality of life, functioning, or clinician\/participant impression. NAC was well-tolerated with only mild gastrointestinal adverse events associated with the treatment. We found no evidence supporting the efficacy of the adjunctive use of NAC in OCD.","232":"Smoking represents a significant health threat to the population, however there remains a core group of consistent smokers that are largely unable to break the addiction. Novel therapies are required to assist this group with cessation. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a nutraceutical supplement that has shown efficacy compared to placebo in previous pilot studies for assisting smokers to quit or reduce their consumption of cigarettes. A double-blind, randomised trial with a treatment period of 16 weeks and a final follow-up at 42 weeks was conducted comparing 1.8g of effervescent NAC per day (n=47) with placebo (n=47) as an aide to smoking cessation. Both study arms received adjunctive online support through the QuitCoach program. Participants reported smoking at each timepoint (baseline and weeks 8, 16 & 42), which was confirmed through salivary cotinine and exhaled carbon monoxide testing. Primary and secondary analyses were undertaken using a modified intent-to-treat basis, including all participants with at least one valid post baseline outcome, regardless of treatment received or their withdrawal from the study. There was no significant difference in smoking outcomes between intervention groups among the 24 participants that competed follow-up. There were no significant differences in age, gender, or body mass index (BMI) between the groups lost to follow-up or recorded at follow-up. This study found no evidence to support NAC as a therapy for smoking cessation. The negative outcome could be the result of lack of treatment efficacy, or alternatively, small sample size, participant retention difficulties, dose, or duration of follow-up.

This has led to the investigation of NAC as a potential candidate for the treatment of BD. The aim of this study was to investigate metabolomic markers to identify predictors of NAC response in a cohort of BD participants. This study is a secondary analysis of a 16-week, multi-site, randomized, double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial in BD participants with a current acute depressive episode. This study included trial participants who received either NAC 2000\u00a0mg\/day, or placebo. Participants (NAC: n\u00a0=\u00a031, placebo: n\u00a0=\u00a029) were assessed at baseline and week 16 using the Montgomery \u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and were dichotomised into \"responders\" (MADRS at week 16\u00a0<\u00a050% of MADRS at baseline) and \"non-responders\" (MADRS at week 16\u00a0>\u00a050% at baseline). Untargeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was performed to analyse baseline levels of 68 serum metabolites. Of the nine metabolites that differentiated placebo and NAC groups, five were amino acids with lower levels in the NAC responder group compared with the NAC non-responders. Further analysis generated a predictive model of MADRS improvement including glycine, norleucine, threonine, proline, phenylalanine, tyrosine, glutamic acid, lysine and leucine (R<sup>2<\/sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.853; adjusted R<sup>2<\/sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.733). This prediction model predicted 85% of the variance in MADRS outcome after adjunctive treatment with NAC. BD participants with lower serum levels of free amino acids at baseline may be more likely to respond to adjunctive treatment with NAC.","234":"Methamphetamine dependence is a significant global health concern for which there are no approved medications. The cysteine prodrug, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), has been found to ameliorate glutamate dysregulation in addiction, and to reduce craving for methamphetamine and other drugs. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of NAC as a pharmacotherapy for methamphetamine dependence. A parallel double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial of people dependent on methamphetamine recruited from Geelong, Melbourne and Wollongong, Australia, between July 2018 and December 2019. Participants were randomised to receive either 12 weeks of oral NAC (2400\u00a0mg\/day) or matched placebo, delivered as a take-home medication. The primary outcome was methamphetamine use, measured in two ways: (a) change in days of use in the past 4 weeks from baseline to weeks 4, 8 and 12, assessed using the Timeline Followback; and (b) methamphetamine-positive oral fluid samples taken weekly. Analyses were intention-to-treat and based on imputed data. Secondary outcomes were craving, severity of dependence, withdrawal severity and psychiatric symptoms (depression, suicidality, hostility and psychotic symptoms). Significance levels were <i>p<\/i>\u00a0<\u00a00.025 for primary outcomes and <i>p<\/i>\u00a0<\u00a00.01 for secondary outcomes. Adverse events were compared between groups by system organ class. The study was prospectively registered, ACTRN12618000366257. Participants (<i>N<\/i>\u00a0=\u00a0153; 59% male, mean [SD] age 38 [8]) were randomised to placebo (<i>n<\/i>\u00a0=\u00a077) or NAC (<i>n<\/i>\u00a0=\u00a076). Both groups had a median (IQR) of 24 (15-28) days of methamphetamine use in the 4 weeks prior to baseline. Both groups significantly reduced methamphetamine use (mean [SE] reduction of 7.3 [1.2]) days for placebo, 6.8 [1.2] for NAC) but NAC did not reduce days of methamphetamine use more than placebo (group difference of 0.5 days, 97.5% CI -3.4-4.3). There was no significant effect of NAC on methamphetamine-positive oral fluid samples (placebo 79%, NAC 76%; mean difference -2.6, 97.5% CI -12.6-7.4). NAC did not significantly reduce craving, severity of dependence, withdrawal, suicidality, depression, hostility or psychotic symptoms relative to placebo. Adverse events did not differ significantly between placebo and NAC groups. These findings suggest that take-home oral NAC has no significant effect on methamphetamine use or most clinically related outcomes amongst people who are dependent on the drug.","235":"Tobacco smoking is a highly prevalent, addictive behaviour and a key public health priority. However available cessation therapies have low quit and high relapse rates, indicating an urgent need for more effective treatments. Predicated on promising preclinical and pilot clinical data, this paper presents a rationale and protocol for the trial of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) as a novel anti-craving smoking cessation aid. Current smokers (n\u2009=\u2009120) of at least 10 cigarettes a day are recruited through online advertisements, print publications and dissemination of flyers. Participants are randomised on a 1:1 ratio to receive either 16-week treatment of 1.8\u2009g\/day of NAC or placebo with all participants receiving quit support from the online QuitCoach tool. Participants are attending visits at baseline, 8 and 16\u2009weeks with a 42-week post-discontinuation follow-up. The primary outcome measure is sustained abstinence at six\u2009months after treatment based on self-reported rating scales and confirmed by exhaled carbon monoxide and salivary cotinine levels. Secondary outcomes are timing of the first lapse and relapse, between-group cigarette consumption, withdrawal symptoms, general wellbeing and mood\/anxiety symptoms. Between-group differences in adverse events and subgroup analyses for variables including gender and Diagnostic Statistics Manual 5 diagnostics will also be investigated. The planned trial addresses an issue of major importance to human health and, if an effect is shown, may result in substantial changes to the management of smoking and nicotine addiction with overt public health implications.

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been found to reduce the craving for methamphetamine and other drugs, but its effect on methamphetamine use and other clinically related endpoints are uncertain. The N-ICE trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of NAC as a take-home pharmacotherapy for methamphetamine dependence. This is a two-arm parallel double-blind placebo-controlled three-site randomised trial (ratio 1:1) using permuted block randomisation, with variable block sizes. It is stratified by site, sex and whether the methamphetamine is injected or not. Participants (N\u2009=\u2009180; 60 per site) need to be dependent on methamphetamine, interested in reducing their methamphetamine use and not currently receiving treatment for substance use disorders. The trial is being conducted in outpatient settings in Melbourne, Geelong and Wollongong, Australia. Participants will receive either 2400\u2009mg oral NAC or a matched placebo, delivered as a take-home medication for 12\u2009weeks. Two 600\u2009mg capsules are self-administered in the morning and two more in the evening. Adherence is being monitored using eCAP\u2122 medication bottle lids, which record the date and time of each occasion the bottle is opened. The primary outcome is methamphetamine use during the 12-week trial medication period, measured as (a) days of use, assessed using the timeline followback, and (b) methamphetamine-positive saliva tests, taken weekly. Secondary measures include weekly assessment of methamphetamine craving, severity of methamphetamine dependence, methamphetamine withdrawal symptoms and psychiatric symptoms (depression, suicidality, psychotic symptoms and hostility). Adverse events are monitored at each weekly assessment. Tolerability is assessed using the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication. The N-ICE trial is the first clinical trial to assess whether NAC can reduce methamphetamine use. This trial will improve our understanding of the potential utility of NAC in managing methamphetamine dependence and clinically related outcomes. If found to be effective, take-home NAC could be a potentially scalable and affordable pharmacotherapy option for treating methamphetamine dependence.

A randomized, double-blind, multicentre, placebo-controlled trial including adult subjects diagnosed with bipolar disorder, currently experiencing a depressive episode. Participants were treated with 3\u202fg\/day NAC or placebo as an adjunctive to standard treatment for 20 weeks, followed by a 4-week washout where the blinding was maintained. The primary outcome was the mean change in the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score over the 20-week treatment phase. Linear Mixed Effects Repeated Measures (LMERM) was used for analysing the primary outcome. A total of 80 subjects were included. The mean MADRS score at baseline was 30.1 and 28.8 in participants randomized to NAC and placebo, respectively. Regarding the primary outcome measure, the between-group difference (NAC vs. placebo) was 0.5, which was statistically non-significant (95% CI: -7.0-5.9;p\u202f=\u202f0.88). All findings regarding secondary outcomes were statistically or clinically insignificant. The study had a placebo response rate of 55.6% - high placebo response rates are associated with failure to separate from placebo. Based on our primary outcome measure, we could not confirm previous studies showing a therapeutic effect of adjunctive NAC treatment on acute bipolar depression. Further studies with larger samples are needed to elucidate if specific subgroups could benefit from adjunctive NAC treatment.","238":"Atypical antipsychotics have been shown to improve disruptive and repetitive behaviors in pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs), but they require assessment of potential side effects. This is the first placebo-controlled trial of olanzapine in the treatment of children and adolescents with PDD. Eleven patients with a diagnosis of either autism, Asperger's syndrome, or PDD not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) and aged 6-14 years were randomized into an 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel treatment study with olanzapine. There was a significant linear trend x group interaction on the Clinical Global Impressions- Improvement (CGI-I) and 50% on olanzapine versus 20% on placebo were responders. Olanzapine was associated with significant weight gain (7.5 +\/- 4.8 lbs vs. 1.5 +\/- 1.5 lbs on placebo). Olanzapine may be a promising treatment for improving global functioning of PDDs, but the risk of significant weight gain remains a concern. Additional studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of olanzapine in the treatment of children with PDD.","239":"Nonresponse to treatment in obsessive-compulsive disorder is common, associated with substantial impairment, and understudied.

We sought to examine the feasibility of a novel, Internet-based clinical trial design to evaluate the efficacy of this supplement. E-mail invitations were sent to parents of children aged 5 to 8 years enrolled in the Interactive Autism Network. All study procedures, including screening, informed consent, and collection of outcome measures took place over the Internet. The primary outcome measures were parent- and teacher-rated changes in hyperactivity on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC-H). During the 6-week recruitment period, 57 children from 28 states satisfied all eligibility criteria and were randomly assigned to 1.3 grams of omega-3 fatty acids or an identical placebo daily for 6 weeks. Outcome assessments were obtained from all 57 participants and 57 teachers, and the study was completed in 3 months. Children in the omega-3 fatty acid group had a greater reduction in hyperactivity (-5.3 points) compared to the placebo group (-2.6 points), but the difference was not statistically significant (1.9-point greater improvement in the omega-3 group, 95% CI = -2.2 to 5.2). Adverse events were rare and not associated with omega-3 fatty acids. Participant feedback was positive. Internet-based, randomized controlled trials of therapies in children with ASD are feasible and may lead to marked reductions in the time and cost of completing trials. A larger sample size is required to definitively determine the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids.

One small randomized controlled trial (n = 13) noted non-significant improvements in hyperactivity and stereotypy. The remaining five studies were small (n = 30, 22, 19, 9, and 1) with four reporting improvements in a wide range of outcomes including language and learning skills, parental observations of general health and behavior, a clinician-administered symptom scale, and clinical observations of anxiety. Due to the limitations of evidence from uncontrolled studies and the presence of only one small randomized controlled trial, there is currently insufficient scientific evidence to determine if omega-3 fatty acids are safe or effective for ASD.","243":"alpha-Linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3n-3) has been associated inconsistently with an increased risk of prostate cancer. Additional studies have become available since the publication of 2 previous meta-analyses. The objective was to review the published data on the relation between ALA and prostate cancer. We conducted a systematic review to identify studies that included data on ALA and risk of prostate cancer. Data were pooled from studies that compared the highest ALA quantile with the lowest ALA quantile, and risk estimates were combined by using a random-effects model. The relation between ALA and prostate cancer is inconsistent across studies. We pooled data from 8 case-control and 8 prospective studies. The summary estimate revealed that high ALA dietary intakes or tissue concentrations are weakly associated with prostate cancer risk (relative risk [RR]: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.43). When examined by study type (ie, retrospective compared with prospective or dietary ALA compared with tissue concentration) or by decade of publication, only the 6 studies examining blood or tissue ALA concentrations revealed a statistically significant association. With the exception of these studies, there was significant heterogeneity and evidence of publication bias. After adjustment for publication bias, there was no association between ALA and prostate cancer (RR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.79, 1.17). Studies examining the relation between ALA and prostate cancer have produced inconsistent findings. High ALA intakes or high blood and adipose tissue concentrations of ALA may be associated with a small increased risk of prostate cancer. However, these conclusions are qualified because of the heterogeneity across studies and the likelihood of publication bias.","244":null,"245":"An imbalance in the excitatory\/inhibitory systems with abnormalities in the glutamatergic pathways has been implicated in the pathophysiology of autism. Furthermore, chronic redox imbalance was also recently linked to this disorder. The goal of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility of using oral N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a glutamatergic modulator and an antioxidant, in the treatment of behavioral disturbance in children with autism. This was a 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of NAC in children with autistic disorder. Subjects randomized to NAC were initiated at 900 mg daily for 4 weeks, then 900 mg twice daily for 4 weeks and 900 mg three times daily for 4 weeks. The primary behavioral measure (Aberrant Behavior Checklist [ABC] irritability subscale) and safety measures were performed at baseline and 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Secondary measures included the ABC stereotypy subscale, Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised, and Social Responsiveness Scale. Thirty-three subjects (31 male subjects, 2 female subjects; aged 3.2-10.7 years) were randomized in the study. Follow-up data was available on 14 subjects in the NAC group and 15 in the placebo group. Oral NAC was well tolerated with limited side effects. Compared with placebo, NAC resulted in significant improvements on ABC irritability subscale (F = 6.80; p < .001; d = .96). Data from this pilot investigation support the potential usefulness of NAC for treating irritability in children with autistic disorder. Large randomized controlled investigations are warranted.","246":"Oxytocin (OT), the brain's most abundant neuropeptide, plays an important role in social salience and motivation. Clinical trials of the efficacy of OT in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have reported mixed results due in part to ASD's complex etiology. We investigated whether genetic and epigenetic variation contribute to variable endogenous OT levels that modulate sensitivity to OT therapy. To carry out this analysis, we integrated genome-wide profiles of DNA-methylation, transcriptional activity, and genetic variation with plasma OT levels in 290 participants with ASD enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of OT. Our analysis identified genetic variants with novel association with plasma OT, several of which reside in known ASD risk genes. We also show subtle but statistically significant association of plasma OT levels with peripheral transcriptional activity and DNA-methylation profiles across several annotated gene sets. These findings broaden our understanding of the effects of the peripheral oxytocin system and provide novel genetic candidates for future studies to decode the complex etiology of ASD and its interaction with OT signaling and OT-based interventions. LAY SUMMARY: Oxytocin (OT) is an abundant chemical produced by neurons that plays an important role in social interaction and motivation. We investigated whether genetic and epigenetic factors contribute to variable OT levels in the blood. To this, we integrated genetic, gene expression, and non-DNA regulated (epigenetic) signatures with blood OT levels in 290 participants with autism enrolled in an OT clinical trial. We identified genetic association with plasma OT, several of which reside in known autism risk genes. We also show statistically significant association of plasma OT levels with gene expression and epigenetic across several gene pathways. These findings broaden our understanding of the factors that influence OT levels in the blood for future studies to decode the complex presentation of autism and its interaction with OT and OT-based treatment.","247":"Experimental studies and small clinical trials have suggested that treatment with intranasal oxytocin may reduce social impairment in persons with autism spectrum disorder. Oxytocin has been administered in clinical practice to many children with autism spectrum disorder. We conducted a 24-week, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial of intranasal oxytocin therapy in children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age with autism spectrum disorder. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, with stratification according to age and verbal fluency, to receive oxytocin or placebo, administered intranasally, with a total target dose of 48 international units daily. The primary outcome was the least-squares mean change from baseline on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist modified Social Withdrawal subscale (ABC-mSW), which includes 13 items (scores range from 0 to 39, with higher scores indicating less social interaction). Secondary outcomes included two additional measures of social function and an abbreviated measure of IQ. Of the 355 children and adolescents who underwent screening, 290 were enrolled. A total of 146 participants were assigned to the oxytocin group and 144 to the placebo group; 139 and 138 participants, respectively, completed both the baseline and at least one postbaseline ABC-mSW assessments and were included in the modified intention-to-treat analyses. The least-squares mean change from baseline in the ABC-mSW score (primary outcome) was -3.7 in the oxytocin group and -3.5 in the placebo group (least-squares mean difference, -0.2; 95% confidence interval, -1.5 to 1.0; P\u2009=\u20090.61). Secondary outcomes generally did not differ between the trial groups. The incidence and severity of adverse events were similar in the two groups. This placebo-controlled trial of intranasal oxytocin therapy in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder showed no significant between-group differences in the least-squares mean change from baseline on measures of social or cognitive functioning over a period of 24 weeks.

In total, 290 participants ages 3 to 17\u202fyears with a DSM-5 diagnosis of ASD were enrolled to receive 24\u202fweeks of treatment with either oxytocin or a matched placebo at one of seven collaborating sites. Participants were subsequently treated with open-label oxytocin for 24 additional weeks. Post-treatment assessments were done approximately 4\u202fweeks after treatment discontinuation. Plasma oxytocin and oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) methylation level were measured at baseline, and week 8, 24 and 36 to explore potential relationships between these biomarkers and treatment response. This report describes the rationale, design, and methods of the SOARS-B clinical trial. There is a tremendous unmet need for safe and effective pharmacological treatment options that target the core symptoms of ASD. Several studies support the hypothesis that intranasal oxytocin could improve social orienting and the salience of social rewards in ASD, thereby enhancing reciprocal social behaviors. However, due to conflicting results from a number of pilot studies on the prosocial effects of exogenous oxytocin, this hypothesis remains controversial and inconclusive. SOARS-B is the best powered study to date to address this hypothesis and promises to improve our understanding of the safety and efficacy of intranasal oxytocin in the treatment of social deficits in children with ASD.","249":"Although oxytocin may provide a novel therapeutics for the core features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), previous results regarding the efficacy of repeated or higher dose oxytocin are controversial, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The current study is aimed to clarify whether repeated oxytocin alter plasma cytokine levels in relation to clinical changes of autism social core feature. Here we analyzed cytokine concentrations using comprehensive proteomics of plasmas of 207 adult males with high-functioning ASD collected from two independent multi-center large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs): Testing effects of 4-week intranasal administrations of TTA-121 (A novel oxytocin spray with enhanced bioavailability: 3U, 6U, 10U, or 20U\/day) and placebo in the crossover discovery RCT; 48U\/day Syntocinon or placebo in the parallel-group verification RCT. Among the successfully quantified 17 cytokines, 4\u00a0weeks TTA-121 6U (the peak dose for clinical effects) significantly elevated IL-7 (9.74, 95\u00a0% confidence interval [CI] 3.59 to 15.90, False discovery rate corrected P (P<sub>FDR<\/sub>)\u00a0<\u00a00.001), IL-9 (56.64, 20.46 to 92.82, P<sub>FDR<\/sub>\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and MIP-1b (18.27, 4.96 to 31.57, P<sub>FDR<\/sub>\u00a0<\u00a00.001) compared with placebo. Inverted U-shape dose-response relationships peaking at TTA-121 6U were consistently observed for all these cytokines (IL-7: P\u00a0<\u00a00.001; IL-9: P\u00a0<\u00a00.001; MIP-1b: P\u00a0=\u00a00.002). Increased IL-7 and IL-9 in participants with ASD after 4\u00a0weeks TTA-121 6U administration compared with placebo was verified in the confirmatory analyses in the dataset before crossover (P<sub>FDR<\/sub>\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Furthermore, the changes in all these cytokines during 4\u00a0weeks of TTA-121 10U administration revealed associations with changes in reciprocity score, the original primary outcome, observed during the same period (IL-7: Coefficient\u00a0=\u00a0-0.05, -0.10 to 0.003, P\u00a0=\u00a00.067; IL-9: -0.01, -0.02 to -0.003, P\u00a0=\u00a00.005; MIP-1b: -0.02, -0.04 to -0.007, P\u00a0=\u00a00.005). These findings provide the first evidence for a role of interaction between oxytocin and neuroinflammation in the change of ASD core social features, and support the potential role of this interaction as a novel therapeutic seed.

However, there is a growing body of empirical evidence highlighting oxytocin's modulatory effects on social and communicative behaviors. Numerous single-dose trials have consistently demonstrated the efficacy of oxytocin in ameliorating behavioral and neural measurements associated with the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. Nevertheless, prior investigations involving the repeated administration of oxytocin have yielded disparate findings concerning its effectiveness, particularly in relation to clinical measures of the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. Recent studies have also raised the possibility of diminishing efficacy of oxytocin over time, particularly when higher or recurrent dosages of oxytocin are administered. This review article aims to provide an overview of previous studies examining this issue. Furthermore, it aims to discuss the potential mechanisms underlying these effects, including the interaction between oxytocin and vasopressin, as well as potential strategies for addressing the challenges mentioned. This review's overall objective is to provide insights into the potential development of innovative therapeutics to mitigate the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, representing potential breakthroughs in the treatment of this complex neurodevelopmental condition.","251":"Although intranasal oxytocin is expected to be a novel therapy for the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, which has currently no approved medication, the efficacy of repeated administrations was inconsistent, suggesting that the optimal dose for a single administration of oxytocin is not optimal for repeated administration. The current double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, crossover trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03466671) was aimed to test the effect of TTA-121, a new formulation of intranasal oxytocin spray with an enhanced bioavailability (3.6 times higher than Syntocinon\u00ae spray, as assessed by area under the concentration-time curve in rabbit brains), which enabled us to test a wide range of multiple doses, on autism spectrum disorder core symptoms and to determine the dose-response relationship. Four-week administrations of TTA-121, at low dose once per day (3 U\/day), low dose twice per day (6 U\/day), high dose once per day (10 U\/day), or high dose twice per day (20 U\/day), and 4-week placebo were administered in a crossover manner. The primary outcome was the mean difference in the reciprocity score (range: 0-14, higher values represent worse outcomes) on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule between the baseline and end point of each administration period. This trial with two administration periods and eight groups was conducted at seven university hospitals in Japan, enrolling adult males with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder. Enrolment began from June 2018 and ended December 2019. Follow-up ended March 2020. Of 109 males with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder who were randomized, 103 completed the trial. The smallest P-value, judged as the dose-response relationship, was the contrast with the peak at TTA-121 6 U\/day, with inverted U-shape for both the full analysis set (P = 0.182) and per protocol set (P = 0.073). The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule reciprocity score, the primary outcome, was reduced in the TTA-121 6 U\/day administration period compared with the placebo (full analysis set: P = 0.118, mean difference = -0.5; 95% CI: -1.1 to 0.1; per protocol set: P = 0.012, mean difference = -0.8; 95% CI: -1.3 to -0.2). The per protocol set was the analysis target population, consisting of all full analysis set participants except those who deviated from the protocol. Most dropouts from the full analysis set to the per protocol set occurred because of poor adherence to the test drug (9 of 12 in the first period and 8 of 15 in the second period). None of the secondary clinical and behavioural outcomes were significantly improved with the TTA-121 compared with the placebo in the full analysis set. A novel intranasal spray of oxytocin with enhanced bioavailability enabled us to test a wide range of multiple doses, revealing an inverted U-shape dose-response curve, with the peak at a dose that was lower than expected from previous studies. The efficacy of TTA-121 shown in the current exploratory study should be verified in a future large-scale, parallel-group trial.","252":"Oxytocin is expected as a novel therapeutic agent for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) core symptoms. However, previous results on the efficacy of repeated administrations of oxytocin are controversial. Recently, we reported time-course changes in the efficacy of the neuropeptide underlying the controversial effects of repeated administration; however, the underlying mechanisms remained unknown. The current study explored metabolites representing the molecular mechanisms of oxytocin's efficacy using high-throughput metabolomics analysis on plasma collected before and after 6-week repeated intranasal administration of oxytocin (48\u00a0IU\/day) or placebo in adult males with ASD (N\u2009=\u2009106) who participated in a multi-center, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial. Among the 35 metabolites measured, a significant increase in N,N-dimethylglycine was detected in the subjects administered oxytocin compared with those given placebo at a medium effect size (false discovery rate (FDR) corrected P\u2009=\u20090.043, d\u2009=\u20090.74, N\u2009=\u200983). Furthermore, subgroup analyses of the participants displaying a prominent time-course change in oxytocin efficacy revealed a significant effect of oxytocin on N,N-dimethylglycine levels with a large effect size (P<sub>FDR<\/sub>\u2009=\u20090.004, d\u2009=\u20091.13, N\u2009=\u200960). The increase in N,N-dimethylglycine was significantly correlated with oxytocin-induced clinical changes, assessed as changes in quantifiable characteristics of autistic facial expression, including both of improvements between baseline and 2\u00a0weeks (P<sub>FDR<\/sub>\u2009=\u20090.006, r\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.485, N\u2009=\u200943) and deteriorations between 2 and 4\u00a0weeks (P<sub>FDR<\/sub>\u2009=\u20090.032, r\u2009=\u20090.415, N\u2009=\u200937). The metabolites changes caused by oxytocin administration were quantified using peripheral blood and therefore may not directly reflect central nervous system changes. Our findings demonstrate an association of N,N-dimethylglycine upregulation with the time-course change in the efficacy of oxytocin on autistic social deficits. Furthermore, the current findings support the involvement of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor and neural plasticity to the time-course change in oxytocin's efficacy.

Given that the oxytocin receptor gene polymorphism (OXTR rs53576) moderates the impact of childhood experience on social behaviors, in the present study, we examined the main effect of childhood adversity through a self-report measure and its interactions with OXTR rs53576 on general trust among 203 Japanese and 200 European Canadian undergraduate students. After controlling for the effect of culture, the results indicated that childhood adversity had a negative association with general trust, and that OXTR rs53576 moderated the impact of childhood adversity on general trust. Specifically, the negative association between childhood adversity and general trust is only significant among homozygote A-allele carriers. These findings demonstrated that OXTR rs53576 moderated the relations between childhood experiences and social functioning in early adulthood.","254":"Social deficits are key hallmarks of the Clinical High Risk for Psychosis (CHR-P) state and of established psychotic disorders, and contribute to impaired social functioning, indicating a potential target for interventions. However, current treatments do not significantly ameliorate social impairments in CHR-P individuals. Given its critical role in social behaviour and cognition, the oxytocinergic (OT) system is a promising target for novel interventions in CHR-P subjects. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, 30 CHR-P males were studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on two occasions, once after 40IU self-administered intranasal OT and once after placebo. A modified version of the Sally-Anne task was used to assess brain activation during inferring others' beliefs and social emotions. The Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test was acquired prior to the first scan to test whether OT effects were moderated by baseline social-emotional abilities. OT did not modulate behavioural performances but reduced activation in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus compared with placebo while inferring others' social emotions. Furthermore, the relationship between brain activation and task performance after OT administration was moderated by baseline social-emotional abilities. While task accuracy during inferring others' social emotion increased with decreasing activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus in CHR-P individuals with low social-emotional abilities, there was no such relationship in CHR-P individuals with high social-emotional abilities. Our findings may suggest that acute OT administration enhances neural efficiency in the inferior frontal gyrus during inferring others' social emotions in those CHR-P subjects with low baseline social-emotional abilities.","255":"Discrepancies in the efficacy between single-dose and repeated administrations of oxytocin on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) indicate a time-course change in efficacy. However, the hypothesis cannot be tested without a repeatable, objective, and quantitative measurement of the core symptoms of ASD. The author's research group comprehensively examined recently examined reported single-site exploratory (n=18, crossover) and multi-site confirmatory (n=106, parallel-group), double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of six-week intranasal oxytocin (48 IU\/day) in adult males with ASD. The outcomes were statistically representative values of the objectively quantified facial expression intensity during a semi-structured social interaction in the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. The quantitative facial expression analyses on data from these two independent clinical trials successfully detected and verified the therapeutic effect of repeated administrations of intranasal oxytocin on autistic features in facial expressions during social interaction. Furthermore, for the first time, the recent study demonstrated a time-course change in the efficacy: deterioration during the repetitive administration phase and preservation during the post-treatment phase. Together with our recent study regarding neurochemical mechanisms of deteriorating efficacy of oxytocin, the findings are expected to promote further development of optimized objective, quantitative, and repeatable outcome measures for autistic social deficits and to establish an optimized regimen of oxytocin treatment in ASD.","256":"Discrepancies in efficacy between single-dose and repeated administration of oxytocin for autism spectrum disorder have led researchers to hypothesize that time-course changes in efficacy are induced by repeated administrations of the peptide hormone. However, repeatable, objective, and quantitative measurement of autism spectrum disorder's core symptoms are lacking, making it difficult to examine potential time-course changes in efficacy. We tested this hypothesis using repeatable, objective, and quantitative measurement of the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. We examined videos recorded during semi-structured social interaction administered as the primary outcome in single-site exploratory (n = 18, crossover within-subjects design) and multisite confirmatory (n = 106, parallel-group design), double-blind, placebo-controlled 6-week trials of repeated intranasal administrations of oxytocin (48 IU\/day) in adult males with autism spectrum disorder. The main outcomes were statistical representative values of objectively quantified facial expression intensity in a repeatable part of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule: the maximum probability (i.e. mode) and the natural logarithm of mode on the probability density function of neutral facial expression and the natural logarithm of mode on the probability density function of happy expression. Our recent study revealed that increases in these indices characterize autistic facial expression, compared with neurotypical individuals. The current results revealed that oxytocin consistently and significantly decreased the increased natural logarithm of mode on the probability density function of neutral facial expression compared with placebo in exploratory (effect-size, -0.57; 95% CI, -1.27 to 0.13; P = 0.023) and confirmatory trials (-0.41; -0.62 to -0.20; P < 0.001). A significant interaction between time-course (at baseline, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks) and the efficacy of oxytocin on the natural logarithm of mode on the probability density function of neutral facial expression was found in confirmatory trial (P < 0.001). Post hoc analyses revealed maximum efficacy at 2 weeks (P < 0.001, Cohen's d = -0.78; 95% CI, -1.21 to -0.35) and deterioration of efficacy at 4 weeks (P = 0.042, Cohen's d = -0.46; 95% CI, -0.90 to -0.01) and 6 weeks (P = 0.10, Cohen's d = -0.35; 95% CI, -0.77 to 0.08), while efficacy was preserved at 2 weeks post-treatment (i.e. 8 weeks) (P < 0.001, Cohen's d = -1.24; 95% CI, -1.71 to -0.78). Quantitative facial expression analyses successfully verified the positive effects of repeated oxytocin on autistic individuals' facial expressions and demonstrated a time-course change in efficacy. The current findings support further development of an optimized regimen of oxytocin treatment.","257":"Research on the pathophysiology of syndromic autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has contributed to the uncovering of mechanisms in nonsyndromic ASD. The current review aims to compare recent progress in therapeutics development for ASD with those for fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most frequent monogenic form of ASD. Although candidates such as oxytocin, vasopressin, and cannabinoids are being tested as novel therapeutics, it remains difficult to focus on a specific molecular target of drug development for ASD core symptoms. As the pathophysiology of FXS has been well described as having a causal gene, fragile X mental retardation-1, development of therapeutic agents for FXS is focused on specific molecular targets, such as metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 and GABAB receptor. There is a large unmet medical need in ASD, a heterogeneous and clinically defined behavioral syndrome, owing to its high prevalence in the general population, lifelong cognitive and behavioral deficits, and no established treatment of ASD core symptoms, such as deficits in social communication and restrictive repetitive behaviors. The molecular pathogenesis of nonsyndromic ASD is largely undefined. Lessons from initial attempts at targeted treatment development in FXS, and new designs resulting from these lessons, will inform trials in nonsyndromic ASD for development of therapeutics for its core symptoms.","258":"Approximately half of all autism spectrum disorder (ASD) individuals suffer from comorbid intellectual disabilities. Furthermore, the prevalence of epilepsy has been estimated to be 46% of patients with low intelligence quotient. It is important to investigate the therapeutic benefits and adverse effects of any recently developed drugs for this proportion of individuals with the so-called Kanner type of ASD. Therefore, we investigated the therapeutic and\/or adverse effects of intranasal oxytocin (OT) administration, especially in adolescents and adults with ASD and comorbid intellectual disability and epilepsy, with regard to core symptoms of social deficits. We have already reported three randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs). However, we revisit results in our pilot studies from the view of comorbidity. Most of the intellectually disabled participants were found to be feasible participants of the RCT. We observed significantly more events regarded as reciprocal social interaction in the OT group compared with the placebo group. In the trial, no or little differences in adverse events were found between the OT and placebo arms, as found in some other reports. However, seizures were induced in three participants with medical history of epilepsy during or after OT treatment. In conclusion, we stress that behavioral changes in ASD patients with intellectual disabilities could be recognized not by the conventional measurements of ASD symptoms but by detailed evaluation of social interactions arising in daily-life situations.","259":"Autonomic dysfunction has been widely studied in individuals with autism spectral disorder (ASD); however, the autonomic response to probiotic and oxytocin (OT) combination intervention has not yet been explored. We conducted the present study that includes 35 individuals with ASD aged 3-20 years to explore autonomic responses to daily Lactobacillus plantarum probiotic supplementation and OT nasal spray treatment both alone and in combination. We identified significant improvements in autonomic indices from subjects receiving combination treatment relative to those receiving placebo. Parameters that were observed to improve following combination treatment are time domain metrics of heart rate variability (HRV), including the root mean square of successive differences between normal heartbeats (RMSSD), standard deviation of normal-to-normal R-R intervals (SDNN), and proportion of the number of pairs of adjacent NN intervals that differ by more than 50ms (pNN50, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Furthermore, individuals that received either probiotics or OT alone demonstrated fewer changes in RMSSD, pNN50, and SDNN. Several parameters that demonstrated significant improvements in combination therapy were found to be correlated with baseline levels of OT (LF power: r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.86, p\u00a0=\u00a00.024; mean HR: r\u00a0=\u00a00.89, p\u00a0=\u00a00.012). Additionally, Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) raw total scores (mean HR, r\u00a0=\u00a00.86, p\u00a0=\u00a00.024) and Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) raw total scores (mean HR r\u00a0=\u00a00.94, p\u00a0=\u00a00.017) were correlated with mean heart rate (HR) and HRV-derived parameters. These results provide further evidence of synergy of probiotic and OT combination and help us gain a better understanding of the role of the gut-brain axis in ASD phenotypes and pathogenesis.","260":"Inflammation, autoimmunity, and gut-brain axis have been implicated in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Carboxyhemoglobin (SpCO) as a non-invasive measurement of inflammation has not been studied in individuals with ASD. We conducted this post-hoc study based on our published clinical trial to explore SpCO and its association with ASD severity, autoimmunity, and response to daily Lactobacillus plantarum probiotic supplementation. In this study, we included 35 individuals with ASD aged 3-20\u00a0years from a previously published clinical trial of the probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive daily Lactobacillus plantarum probiotic (6\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>10<\/sup> CFUs) or a placebo for 16\u00a0weeks. The outcomes in this analysis include Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), Aberrant Behavior Checklist second edition (ABC-2), Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, SpCO measured by CO-oximetry, fecal microbiome by 16\u00a0s rRNA sequencing, blood serum inflammatory markers, autoantibodies, and oxytocin (OT) by ELISA. We performed Kendall's correlation to examine their interrelationships and used Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare the means of all outcomes between the two groups at baseline and 16\u00a0weeks. Elevated levels of serum anti-tubulin, CaM kinase II, anti-dopamine receptor D1 (anti-D1), and SpCO were found in the majority of ASD subjects. ASD severity is correlated with SpCO (baseline, R\u2009=\u20090.38, p\u2009=\u20090.029), anti-lysoganglioside GM1 (R\u2009=\u20090.83, p\u2009=\u20090.022), anti-tubulin (R\u2009=\u20090.69, p\u2009=\u20090.042), and anti-D1 (R\u2009=\u20090.71, p\u2009=\u20090.045) in treatment group. The findings of the present study suggests that the easily administered and non-invasive SpCO test offers a potentially promising autoimmunity and inflammatory biomarker to screen\/subgroup ASD and monitor the treatment response to probiotics. Furthermore, we propose that the associations between autoantibodies, gut microbiome profile, serum OT level, GI symptom severity, and ASD core symptom severity scores are specific to the usage of probiotic treatment in our subject cohort. Taken together, these results warrant further studies to improve ASD early diagnosis and treatment outcomes.

Both probiotics and oxytocin were reported to have therapeutic potential; however, the combination therapy has not yet been studied. We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 2-stage pilot trial in 35 individuals with ASD aged 3-20 years (median = 10.30 years). Subjects were randomly assigned to receive daily <i>Lactobacillus plantarum<\/i> PS128 probiotic (6 \u00d7 10<sup>10<\/sup> CFUs) or a placebo for 28 weeks; starting on week 16, both groups received oxytocin. The primary outcomes measure socio-behavioral severity using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC). The secondary outcomes include measures of the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, fecal microbiome, blood serum inflammatory markers, and oxytocin. All outcomes were compared between the two groups at baseline, 16 weeks, and 28 weeks into treatment. We observed improvements in ABC and SRS scores and significant improvements in CGI-improvement between those receiving probiotics and oxytocin combination therapy compared to those receiving placebo (<i>p<\/i> < 0.05). A significant number of favorable gut microbiome network hubs were also identified after combination therapy (<i>p<\/i> < 0.05). The favorable social cognition response of the combination regimen is highly correlated with the abundance of the Eubacterium hallii group. Our findings suggest synergic effects between probiotics PS128 and oxytocin in ASD patients, although further investigation is warranted.","262":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in social interaction and communication. Oxytocin (OXT), as a neuropeptide, plays a role in emotional and social behaviors. <i>Lactobacillus reuteri<\/i> (<i>L. reuteri<\/i>) supplementation led to an OXT-dependent behavioral improvement in ASD mouse models. Despite some promising results from animal studies, little is known about the efficacy of supplementation with <i>L. reuteri<\/i>, alone or with exogenous OXT therapy, on social-behavioral functions in ASD patients. This paper presents a protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a full trial comparing oral supplementation of <i>L. reuteri<\/i> probiotics and intranasal OXT spray to placebo on the effect of social and behavioral functions in ASD patients. The study will also capture preliminary estimates of the efficacy of the proposed interventions in ASD patients. This pilot trial is a two-staged, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Throughout the study (0-24 weeks), 60 patients with ASD will be randomly assigned to receive either oral <i>L. reuteri<\/i> probiotics or placebo. In the second study stage (13-24 weeks), all participants will receive intranasal OXT spray. As primary outcomes, serum OXT levels will be assayed and social behaviors will be assessed via the Autism Behavior Checklist and the Social Responsiveness Scale which are validated questionnaires, an objective emotional facial matching test, and a new video-based eye-tracking test. Secondary outcomes include the GI-severity-index and Bristol Stool Chart to assess GI function and gut microbiome\/short-chain fatty acids. All the outcomes will be assessed at baseline and weeks 12 and 24. This pilot study will provide important information on the feasibility of recruitment, blinding and concealment, treatment administration, tolerability and adherence, specimen collection, outcome assessment, potential adverse effects, and the preliminary efficacy on both primary and secondary outcomes. If successful, this pilot study will inform a larger randomized controlled trial fully powered to examine the efficacies of oral <i>L. reuteri<\/i> probiotics and\/or intranasal OXT spray on social-behavioral improvement in ASD patients.

Despite advances in the treatment of this symptom domain in autism, there remains an ongoing need for more effective and better tolerated pharmacotherapies. The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness and tolerability of paliperidone for irritability in autism. This is a prospective, 8-week open-label study of paliperidone in 25 adolescents and young adults with autism. Primary outcome measures included the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) Scale and the Irritability subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC-I). Concomitant medications (except antipsychotics) were permitted if dosages were stable for \u22652 months. Twenty-one (84 %) of 25 subjects ages 12-21 years (mean 15.3 years) responded to paliperidone, based on a CGI-I Scale score of 1 or 2 (very much or much improved) and \u226525 % improvement on the ABC-I. The mean final dosage of paliperidone was 7.1 mg\/day (range 3-12 mg\/day). Two subjects discontinued paliperidone prior to study completion (moderate sedation, n\u2009=\u20091; nonresponse, n\u2009=\u20091). Mild-to-moderate extrapyramidal symptoms were recorded in four subjects. A mean weight gain of 2.2 \u00b1 2.6 kg (range -3.6 to +7.9 kg) was recorded. Mean age- and sex-normed body mass index increased from 23.6 to 24.2 (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.001). Mean serum prolactin increased from 5.3 to 41.4 ng\/mL (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.0001). Paliperidone treatment was associated with significant improvement in irritability and was generally well tolerated. Larger scale, placebo-controlled studies are needed to elucidate the efficacy and tolerability of paliperidone in this population.","264":null,"265":null,"266":"Negative symptoms of schizophrenia represent an unmet therapeutic need for many patients in whom pentoxifylline may be effective in terms of its dopaminergic, anti-inflammatory, and cerebral blood flow-increasing properties. This study aimed to evaluate pentoxifylline as a therapeutic agent for improving negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Chronic schizophrenia outpatients experiencing significant negative symptoms were randomly allocated to receive pentoxifylline 400\u00a0mg or matched placebo every 12 hours for 8 weeks. All patients were clinically stable as they had received risperidone for at least 2 months, which was continued. The participants were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale, and side effect checklist. The patients' baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups. There was a significant time-treatment interaction effect on PANSS negative subscale scores (\u03b7P2=0.075), with the pentoxifylline group showing significantly greater reductions until weeks 4 (Cohen d = 0.512) and 8 (Cohen d = 0.622). Also, this group showed a significantly better response by week 8. Other PANSS scores, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores, Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale scores, and side effect frequencies were comparable between the groups. Pentoxifylline showed a nonsignificant higher remission of 37.1% compared with 14.7% in the placebo group. Pentoxifylline was safely and tolerably beneficial for the primary negative symptoms of chronic schizophrenia.","267":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an early-onset disorder with a prevalence of 1% among children and reported disability-adjusted life years of 4.31 million. Irritability is a challenging behavior associated with ASD, for which medication development has lagged. More specifically, pharmacotherapy effectiveness may be limited against high adverse effects (considering side effect profiles and patient medication sensitivity); thus, the possible benefits of pharmacological interventions must be balanced against potential adverse events in each patient. After reviewing the neuropathophysiology of ASD-associated irritability, the benefits and tolerability of emerging medications in its treatment based on randomized controlled trials were detailed in light of mechanisms and targets of action. Succeeding risperidone and aripiprazole, monotherapy with memantine may be beneficial. In addition, N-acetylcysteine, galantamine, sulforaphane, celecoxib, palmitoylethanolamide, pentoxifylline, simvastatin, minocycline, amantadine, pregnenolone, prednisolone, riluzole, propentofylline, pioglitazone, and topiramate, all adjunct to risperidone, and clonidine and methylphenidate outperformed placebo. These effects were through glutamatergic, \u03b3-aminobutyric acidergic, inflammatory, oxidative, cholinergic, dopaminergic, and serotonergic systems. All medications were reported to be safe and tolerable. Considering sample size, follow-up, and effect size, further studies are necessary. Along with drug development, repositioning and combining existing drugs supported by the mechanism of action is recommended.","268":"There are several lines of evidence to indicate that the immune system plays an important role in the pathophysiology of autism. The objective of this study was to access the effects of pentoxifylline plus risperidone in the treatment of autistic disorder. Forty children between the ages 4 and 12 years with a DSM IV-TR clinical diagnosis of autism were recruited. The children presented with a chief complaint of severely disruptive symptoms related to autistic disorder. Patients were randomly allocated to pentoxifylline+risperidone or placebo+risperidone for a 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The dose of risperidone was titrated up to 3 mg\/day, pentoxifylline was titrated to 600 mg\/day. Patients were assessed at baseline and after 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks of starting medication. The measure of the outcome was the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C). The difference between the two protocols was significant as the group that received pentoxifylline had greater reduction in ABC-C subscale scores for Irritability, Lethargy\/Social Withdrawal, Stereotypic Behavior, Hyperactivity\/Noncompliance and Inappropriate Speech. The results suggest that combination of atypical antipsychotic medications and pentoxifylline might have synergistic effects in treatment of behavioral problems of children with autism.","269":"It has been reported that autism is a hypoglutamatergic disorder. Therefore, it was of interest to assess the efficacy of piracetam, a positive modulator of AMPA-sensitive glutamate receptors in autistic disorder. About 40 children between the ages three and 11 years (inclusive) with a DSM IV clinical diagnosis of autism and who were outpatients from a specialty clinic for children were recruited. The children presented with a chief complaint of severely disruptive symptoms related to autistic disorder. Patients were randomly allocated to piracetam + risperidone (Group A) or placebo + risperidone (Group B) for a 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The dose of risperidone was titrated up to 2 mg\/day for children between 10 and 40 kg and 3 mg\/day for children weighting above 40 kg. The dose of piracetam was titrated up to 800 mg\/day. Patients were assessed at baseline and after 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks of starting medication. The measure of the outcome was the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) Rating Scale (total score). The ABC-C Rating Scale scores improved with piracetam. The difference between the two protocols was significant as indicated by the effect of group, the between subjects factor (F = 5.85, d.f. = 1, P = 0.02). The changes at the endpoint compared with baseline were: -11.90 +\/- 3.79 (mean +\/- SD) and -5.15 +\/- 3.04 for group A and B respectively. A significant difference was observed on the change in scores in the ABC-C Rating Scale in week 10 compared with baseline in the two groups (t = 6.017, d.f. = 38, P < 0.0001). The results suggest that a combination of atypical antipsychotic medications and a glutamate agent such as piracetam, might have increase synergistic effects in the treatment of autism.","270":"Different dietary approaches, such as gluten and casein free diets, or the use of probiotics and prebiotics have been suggested in autistic spectrum disorders in order to reduce gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances. GI symptoms are of particular interest in this population due to prevalence and correlation with the severity of behavioural traits. Nowadays, there is lack of strong evidence about the effect of dietary interventions on these problems, particularly prebiotics. Therefore, we assessed the impact of exclusion diets and a 6-week Bimuno\u00ae galactooligosaccharide (B-GOS\u00ae) prebiotic intervention in 30 autistic children. The results showed that children on exclusion diets reported significantly lower scores of abdominal pain and bowel movement, as well as lower abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. and Veillonellaceae family, but higher presence of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bacteroides spp. In addition, significant correlations were found between bacterial populations and faecal amino acids in this group, compared to children following an unrestricted diet. Following B-GOS\u00ae intervention, we observed improvements in anti-social behaviour, significant increase of Lachnospiraceae family, and significant changes in faecal and urine metabolites. To our knowledge, this is the first study where the effect of exclusion diets and prebiotics has been evaluated in autism, showing potential beneficial effects. A combined dietary approach resulted in significant changes in gut microbiota composition and metabolism suggesting that multiple interventions might be more relevant for the improvement of these aspects as well as psychological traits.

However, as microbiome development is a critical factor in children, it remains unclear whether adult fecal donors can provide age-appropriate functional restoration in pediatric patients. To address this issue, we conducted an integrated systems approach and found that concordant donor strain engraftment, along with metabolite restoration, are associated with FMT outcomes in both adult and pediatric rCDI patients. Although functional restoration after FMT is not strain-specific, specialized metabolic functions are retained in pediatric patients when adult fecal donors are used. Furthermore, we demonstrated broad utility of high-resolution variant-calling by linking probiotic-strain engraftment with improved gastrointestinal symptoms in adults with irritable bowel syndrome and in children with autism spectrum disorder. Our findings emphasize the importance of strain-level identification when assessing the efficacy of probiotics and microbiota-based therapeutics.","272":"Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, probiotics, vitamin C, vitamin D, folic acid and L-methyl folate, broad-spectrum micronutrients, N-acetylcysteine, physical activity, herbs, bright light therapy, melatonin, saffron, meditation, school-based interventions, and transcranial photobiomodulation are reviewed, with a focus on their use for treating mood disorders in children and adolescents.

VISBIOME contains eight probiotic species, mostly <i>Lactobacillus<\/i> and <i>Bifidobacterium<\/i>. Primary outcome was the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) GI module. Secondary outcomes included gut microbiota analysis, the Parent-Rated Anxiety Scale for ASD (PRAS-ASD), and parent-selected target symptoms. A mixed analysis model was applied. <b><i>Results:<\/i><\/b> Thirteen children were randomized, with 10 completing the study (77% retention): 6 in probiotic\/placebo sequence, 4 in placebo\/probiotic sequence.

Only 6 of the 10 guessed the correct treatment at the end of week 8. Over the 19-week trial, each outcome improved from baseline and PedsQL correlated significantly with abundance of <i>Lactobacillus<\/i> without discernable changes to microbiota composition\/diversity. Although probiotic showed more improvement than placebo, PedsQL and PRAS-ASD were not statistically significant, as expected at this sample size. PedsQL effect size was <i>d<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.49 by the general model and <i>d<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.79 by simple comparison of week 8 changes.

As such, dietary modulation is important for improved gut health, especially during the highly-sensitive stage of infancy. Diet can affect the composition of the gut microflora through the availability of different substrates for bacterial fermentation. Differences in gut microflora composition and incidence of infection exist between breast-fed and formula-fed infants, with the former thought to have improved protection. Historically, this improvement has been believed to be a result of the higher presence of reportedly-beneficial genera such as the bifidobacteria. As such, functional food ingredients such as prebiotics and probiotics could effect a beneficial modification in the composition and activities of gut microflora of infants by increasing positive flora components. The prebiotic approach aims to increase resident bacteria that are considered to be beneficial for human health, e.g. bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, while probiotics advocates the use of the live micro-organisms themselves in the diet. Both approaches have found their way into infant formula feeds and aim to more closely simulate the gut microbiota composition seen during breast-feeding.","275":"Recent studies have suggested that gut-brain axis may be one of the mechanisms of major depression disorder (MDD). The current study aimed to investigate the effects of <i>Lactobacillus plantarum PS128<\/i> (PS128) on psychophysiology in patients with MDD. We recruited 11 patients with MDD and gave them PS128 for 8 weeks. We compared depression symptoms, serum markers of inflammation and gut permeability, and gut microbiota before and after 8-week intervention and also explored the correlations among symptoms, biomarkers, and gut microbiota. After 8-week PS128 intervention, scores of Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 and Depression and Somatic symptoms Scale significantly decreased. Serum levels of high sensitivity c-reactive protein, interluekin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, zonulin and intestinal fatty acid binding protein, and the composition of gut microbiota did not significantly change after 8-week PS128 intervention. However, we found changes of some genera were correlated with changes of symptoms and biomarkers. In conclusion, this is an open trial with small sample size and has several limitations. The results need to be verified by randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with larger sample size.","276":"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain and alterations in bowel habits. Current treatments for IBS are unsatisfactory due to its multifactorial pathogenesis involving the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Lactobacillus plantarum PS128 (PS128) was reported to exhibit neuromodulatory activity which may be beneficial for improving IBS. This study aimed to investigate the effect of PS128 on visceral hypersensitivity (VH) and the gut-brain axis using a 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)-induced VH rat model without colonic inflammation induction, mimicking the characteristics of IBS. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered with PS128 (10<sup>9<\/sup>\u00a0CFU in 0.2\u00a0mL saline\/rat\/day) or saline (0.2\u00a0mL saline\/rat\/day) for 14\u00a0days. Colorectal distension (CRD) with simultaneous electromyography recording was performed 30\u00a0min before and 30\u00a0min after the 5-HTP injection. Levels of neuropeptides and neurotrophins were analyzed. PS128 significantly reduced VH induced by the 5-HTP injection and CRD. Neurotransmitter protein levels, substance P, CGRP, BDNF, and NGF, were decreased in the dorsal root ganglion but increased in the spinal cord in response to the 5-HTP injection; PS128 reversed these changes. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis was modulated by PS128 with decreased corticosterone concentration in serum and the expression of mineralocorticoid receptors in the amygdala. Oral administration of PS128 inhibited 5-HTP-induced VH during CRD. The ameliorative effect on VH suggests the potential application of PS128 for IBS.","277":"This four-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigated the effects of <i>Lactobacillus plantarum<\/i> PS128 (PS128) on boys with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) aged 7-15 in Taiwan. All subjects fulfilled the criteria for ASD diagnosis of DSM-V and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R). Questionnaires used for the primary outcome measure include the Autism Behavior Checklist-Taiwan version (ABC-T), the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). The Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham-IV-Taiwan version (SNAP-IV) and the Clinical Global Impression-improvement (CGI-I) were used for the secondary outcome measure. The results showed that PS128 ameliorated opposition\/defiance behaviors, and that the total score of SNAP-IV for younger children (aged 712) improved significantly compared with the placebo group. Additionally, several elements were also notably improved in the PS128 group after 28-day consumption of PS128. Further studies are needed to better clarify the effects of PS128 for younger children with ASD on broader symptoms.","278":"Ingestion of specific probiotics, namely \"psychobiotics\", produces psychotropic effects on behavior and affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and neurochemicals in the brain. We examined the psychotropic effects of a potential psychobiotic bacterium, Lactobacillus plantarum strain PS128 (PS128), on mice subjected to early life stress (ELS) and on na\u00efve adult mice. Behavioral tests revealed that chronic ingestion of PS128 increased the locomotor activities in both ELS and na\u00efve adult mice in the open field test. In the elevated plus maze, PS128 significantly reduced the anxiety-like behaviors in na\u00efve adult mice but not in the ELS mice; whereas the depression-like behaviors were reduced in ELS mice but not in na\u00efve mice in forced swimming test and sucrose preference test. PS128 administration also reduced ELS-induced elevation of serum corticosterone under both basal and stressed states but had no effect on na\u00efve mice. In addition, PS128 reduced inflammatory cytokine levels and increased anti-inflammatory cytokine level in the serum of ELS mice. Furthermore, the dopamine level in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) was significantly increased in PS128 treated ELS and na\u00efve adult mice whereas serotonin (5-HT) level was increased only in the na\u00efve adult mice. These results suggest that chronic ingestion of PS128 could ameliorate anxiety- and depression-like behaviors and modulate neurochemicals related to affective disorders. Thus PS128 shows psychotropic properties and has great potential for improving stress-related symptoms.","279":"Sleep is a vital physiological function that is impaired in ranges from 10% in the typically developing pediatric population to over 80% in populations of children with neurodevelopmental disorders and\/or psychiatric comorbidities. Pediatric insomnia disorder is an increasing public health concern given its negative impact on synaptic plasticity involved in learning and memory consolidation but also on mood regulation, hormonal development and growth, and its significant impact on quality of life of the child, the adolescent and the family. While first-line treatment of pediatric insomnia should include parental education on sleep as well as sleep hygiene measures and behavioural treatment approaches, pharmacological interventions may be necessary if these strategies fail. Melatonin treatment has been increasingly used off-label in pediatric insomnia, given its benign safety profile. This article aims to identify the possible role of melatonin treatment for pediatric insomnia, considering its physiological role in sleep regulation and the differential effects of immediate release (IR) versus prolonged release (PR) melatonin. For the physician dealing with pediatric insomnia, it is particularly important to be able to distinguish treatment rationales implying different dosages and times of treatment intake. Finally, we discuss the benefit-risk ratio for melatonin treatment in different pediatric populations, ranging from the general pediatric population to children with different types of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder or ADHD.","280":"<b>Introduction<\/b>: Insomnia is common among children and adolescents with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The first drug licensed for insomnia in this population, a pediatric-appropriate prolonged-release melatonin (PedPRM) formulation is described.<b>Areas covered<\/b>: Literature search on \u00a0PedPRM efficacy and safety profile in clinical trials, and a proposed decision-making algorithm to optimize outcome \u00a0in the treatment of insomnia in children and adolescents with ASD.<b>Expert opinion<\/b>: PedPRM treatment effectively improves sleep onset, duration and consolidation, and daytime externalizing behaviors in children and adolescents with ASD and subsequently caregivers' quality of life and satisfaction with their children's sleep. The coated, odorless and taste-free mini-tablets are well-accepted in this population who often have sensory hypersensitivity and problems swallowing standard tablet preparations. The most frequent long-term treatment-related adverse events were fatigue (6.3%), somnolence (6.3%), and mood swings (4.2%) with no evidence of delay in height, BMI, or pubertal development, or withdrawal effects. The starting dose is 2 mg once daily independent of age or weight, escalated to 5-10 mg\/day if predefined treatment success criteria are unmet. Slow melatonin metabolizers (~10% of children), may require lower doses. Given its long-term efficacy, safety and acceptance, PedPRM may ameliorate long-term consequences of insomnia in this population.","281":"<b>Introduction:<\/b> Insomnia and circadian rhythm disorders, such as the delayed sleep phase syndrome, are frequent in psychiatric disorders and their evaluation and management in early stages should be a priority. The aim of this paper was to express recommendations on the use of exogenous melatonin, which exhibits both chronobiotic and sleep-promoting actions, for the treatment of these sleep disturbances in psychiatric disorders. <b>Methods:<\/b> To this aim, we conducted a systematic review according to PRISMA on the use of melatonin for the treatment of insomnia and circadian sleep disorders in neuropsychiatry. We expressed recommendations for the use of melatonin in psychiatric clinical practice for each disorder using the RAND\/UCLA appropriateness method. <b>Results:<\/b> We selected 41 studies, which included mood disorders, schizophrenia, substance use disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, autism spectrum disorders, neurocognitive disorders, and delirium; no studies were found for both anxiety and eating disorders. <b>Conclusion:<\/b> The administration of prolonged release melatonin at 2-10 mg, 1-2 h before bedtime, might be used in the treatment of insomnia symptoms or comorbid insomnia in mood disorders, schizophrenia, in adults with autism spectrum disorders, neurocognitive disorders and during sedative-hypnotics discontinuation. Immediate release melatonin at <1 mg might be useful in the treatment of circadian sleep disturbances of neuropsychiatric disorders.","282":"The role of melatonin has been extensively investigated in pathophysiological conditions, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Reduced melatonin secretion has been reported in ASD and led to many clinical trials using immediate-release and prolonged-release oral formulations of melatonin. However, melatonin's effects in ASD and the choice of formulation type require further study. Therapeutic benefits of melatonin on sleep disorders in ASD were observed, notably on sleep latency and sleep quality. Importantly, melatonin may also have a role in improving autistic behavioral impairments. The objective of this article is to review factors influencing treatment response and possible side effects following melatonin administration. It appears that the effects of exposure to exogenous melatonin are dependent on age, sex, route and time of administration, formulation type, dose, and association with several substances (such as tobacco or contraceptive pills). In addition, no major melatonin-related adverse effect was described in typical development and ASD. In conclusion, melatonin represents currently a well-validated and tolerated treatment for sleep disorders in children and adolescents with ASD. A more thorough consideration of factors influencing melatonin pharmacokinetics could illuminate the best use of melatonin in this population. Future studies are required in ASD to explore further dose-effect relationships of melatonin on sleep problems and autistic behavioral impairments.","283":"A recent 3-month double-blind, placebo-controlled study demonstrated efficacy and safety of pediatric prolonged-release melatonin (PedPRM) for insomnia in children with autism spectrum disorder. This study examined the long-term effects of PedPRM treatment on sleep, growth, body mass index, and pubertal development. Eighty children and adolescents (2-17.5 years of age; 96% with autism spectrum disorder) who completed the double-blind, placebo-controlled trial were given 2 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg PedPRM nightly up to 104 weeks, followed by a 2-week placebo period to assess withdrawal effects. Improvements in child sleep disturbance and caregiver satisfaction with child sleep patterns, quality of sleep, and quality of life were maintained throughout the 104-week treatment period (p\u00a0< .001 versus baseline for all). During the 2-week withdrawal placebo period, measures declined compared with the treatment period but were still improved compared with baseline. PedPRM was generally safe; the most frequent treatment-related adverse events were fatigue (6.3%), somnolence (6.3%), and mood swings (4.2%). Changes in mean weight, height, body mass index, and pubertal status (Tanner staging done by a physician) were within normal ranges for age with no evidence of delay in body mass index or pubertal development. Nightly PedPRM at optimal dose (2, 5, or 10 mg nightly) is safe and effective for long-term treatment in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder and insomnia. There were no observed detrimental effects on children's growth and pubertal development and no withdrawal or safety issues related to the use or discontinuation of the drug.

A total of 125 children and adolescents (2-17.5 years of age; 96.8% ASD, 3.2% Smith-Magenis syndrome [SMS]) whose sleep failed to improve on behavioral intervention alone were randomized (1:1 ratio), double-blind, to receive PedPRM (2 mg escalated to 5 mg) or placebo for 13 weeks. Sleep measures included the validated caregivers' Sleep and Nap Diary (SND) and Composite Sleep Disturbance Index (CSDI). The a priori primary endpoint was SND-reported total sleep time (TST) after 13 weeks of treatment. The study met the primary endpoint: after 13 weeks of double-blind treatment, participants slept on average 57.5 minutes longer at night with PedPRM compared to 9.14 minutes with placebo (adjusted mean\u00a0treatment difference PedPRM-placebo\u00a0-32.43 minutes; p\u00a0= .034).

The clinical development of nadolol for pediatric use was prioritized by Chinese healthcare authorities in May 2023 while there was a lack of clear medication instructions for children. To expedite the pediatric development of nadolol and provide insights into its off-label applications, we developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model incorporating mechanistic disposition knowledge. This model integrates key processes of nadolol including P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter mediated the absorption of efflux, multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE) 1 transporter and organic cation (OCT) 2 transporter mediated active renal excretion, organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) 1A2 mediated transport, along with biliary excretion. The model accurately captured the pharmacokinetic profiles of nadolol in both Western and East Asian populations following a wide dose range (2-160 mg), including the plasma concentration, urine excretion, and drug-drug interactions with the P-gp inhibitor. After our good validation on interracial adult populations, simulations of nadolol pharmacokinetic profiles in the Chinese population were performed by adjusting the liver volume of the Chinese to 0.9 of the Japanese population. Then, with the consideration of physiological changes and plasma protein ontogeny in pediatrics, the nadolol model for pediatrics was also well-verified on several children aged 3 months to 121 months. Accordingly, specific optimal dosages for children across various ages and racial backgrounds with or without obesity were offered by exposure matching with adults. Multiple remedial regimen simulations were also compared to obtain the best nonadherence management in the case of missed dosages, in which resuming a regular dose as soon as possible was the most recommended.","288":"Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT) is a rare inherited channelopathy, responsible for potentially lethal malignant arrhythmic episodes. Atypical non-juvenile form of CPVT may not mislead an alternative diagnosis of calcium release deficiency syndrome (CRDS). The index case was a 58 years-old woman who experienced aborted sudden cardiac arrest. The initial complete diagnostic workup (including norepinephrine challenge) was completely negative. She was implanted with an entirely subcutaneous defibrillator. During her follow-up, she received an appropriate electrical shock (ventricular fibrillation) despite \u03b2-blocker treatment. Three sisters (46, 40 and 18 years-old) as well as 2 cousins, one paternal uncle and one paternal aunt had sudden cardiac deaths (SCD) without etiology in the family history. There were no additional reports of pregnancy loss, neonatal death, seizures or SCD among the family members. The genetic analysis in this proband revealed a missense pathogenic variant c.13823\u202fG>A, p.(Arg4608Gln) in the RYR2 gene, encoding the Ryanodine Receptor type 2. This c.13823\u202fG>A, p.(Arg4608Gln), variant in the RYR2 gene was supposed to be a potential disease-causing variant in CPVT. Unfortunately, before the end of the proband's genetic analysis, her 20 years-old daughter experienced SCD, whilst being implanted with an insertable cardiac monitor. Familial segregation analysis confirmed the four symptomatic sisters harbor also the same variant confirming the pathogenic role of this variant.

Herein, we report the first example of homogeneous asymmetric hydrogenation of naphthol derivatives catalyzed by tethered rhodium-diamine catalysts, affording a wide array of optically pure 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthols in high yields with excellent regio-, chemo-, and enantioselectivities (up to 98% yield and >99% ee). Mechanistic studies with experimental and computational approaches reveal that fluorinated solvent 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) plays vital roles in the control of reactivity and selectivity, and 1-naphthol is reduced via a cascade reaction pathway, including dearomative tautomerization, 1,4-hydride addition, and 1,2-hydride addition in sequence. A novel synergistic activation mode was proposed in which HFIP assists a synergistic activation of both the hydrogen molecule and naphthol in the presence of a base, and the in situ-generated fleeting keto tautomer is immediately trapped and reduced by the Rh(III)-H species before it escapes from the solvent cage. This protocol provides a straightforward and practical pathway for the synthesis of key intermediates for several chiral drugs. Particularly, optically pure Nadolol, a drug for the treatment of hypertension, angina pectoris, congestive heart failure, and certain arrhythmias, is enantioselectively synthesized for the first time.","290":null,"291":"Green tea (Camellia sinensis) is a commonly consumed beverage or dietary supplement. As a natural product with a myriad of proposed health benefits, patients are likely to consume green tea while taking their medications unaware of its potential to interact with drugs and influence drug efficacy and safety. Catechins are the abundant polyphenolic compounds in green tea (e.g., (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate), which are reported to influence determinants of drug pharmacokinetics, such as drug solubility and the activity of drug transporters and drug metabolizing enzymes. This review summarized the results of clinical studies investigating the influence of green tea catechins on the pharmacokinetics of clinically used medications. The majority of analyses (72%) reported significant decreases (by 18-99%) in systemic drug exposure with green tea consumption (atorvastatin, celiprolol, digoxin, fexofenadine, folic acid, lisinopril, nadolol, nintedanib, raloxifene, and rosuvastatin). One analysis (6%) reported a 50% increase in drug systemic exposure (sildenafil) and for 22% of analyses drug pharmacokinetics were not affected by green tea consumption (fluvastatin, pseudoephedrine, simvastatin, and tamoxifen). For most drugs reporting an interaction, green tea catechins were proposed to decrease intestinal drug absorption by inhibiting OATP uptake (particularly OATP1A2), enhancing P-gp efflux activity or reducing drug solubility. Case reports have associated changes in drug pharmacokinetics with green tea consumption to changes in drug efficacy or safety (e.g., nadolol and erlotinib). These findings prompt the need for further research in relating evidence from existing literature to predict additional clinically important green tea-drug interactions and to provide appropriate recommendations for patients and clinicians.","292":"Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a rare inherited arrhythmia disorder characterized by ventricular arrhythmia triggered by adrenergic stimulation. A 9-year-old boy presented with convulsions following physical exertion. Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (VT) during a treadmill test led to the diagnosis of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). Genetic testing revealed a pathogenic variant of <i>RYR2:c.720G>A (p.ArG2401His)<\/i>. Nadolol was initially started. However, he experienced aborted VT arrest three years later. Flecainide was thus added as dual therapy and he underwent left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD). Subsequently, a transvenous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) was implanted because he still had several episodes of bidirectional VT. Despite a good compliance to medication, the patient still had exercise induced VT episodes with new onset of atrial fibrillation. High dose nadolol was required and amiodarone was added. Despite maximizing the dosage of these three antiarrhythmics, the patient continued to experience multiple episodes of ventricular fibrillation with appropriate ICD shocks and persistent atrial arrhythmias. Right cardiac sympathetic denervation (RCSD) was performed as the last modality of treatment. Patient had a total elimination of VT post bilateral sympathectomy. He remained asymptomatic on follow up. A follow-up treadmill test showed no recurrence of exercise-induced PVCs and VT. We illustrated the challenges and the complex decision-making process encountered in managing refractory CPVT. In patients unresponsive to conventional therapies, RCSD in additional to LCSD is a safe and effective alternative treatment. A history of LCSD should not preclude physicians from considering RCSD in children with refractory CPVT.","293":"Data on the effectiveness of classical non-selective beta-blockers (cNSBBs, i.e., propranolol and nadolol) vs. carvedilol in patients with cirrhosis are scarce. In the present study, we aimed to compare their potential for preventing decompensation and mortality in patients with compensated and decompensated cirrhosis. We performed a multicenter retrospective study including patients with compensated and decompensated cirrhosis with clinically significant portal hypertension, undergoing measurement of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) to assess acute hemodynamic response to intravenous propranolol (i.e., HVPG decrease \u226510% from baseline value) prior to primary prophylaxis for variceal bleeding. Outcomes were adjusted using inverse probability of treatment weighting in a competitive risk framework. A total of 540 patients were included, 256 with compensated (cNSBBs n\u00a0= 111; carvedilol n\u00a0= 145) and 284 with decompensated (cNSBBs n\u00a0= 134; carvedilol n\u00a0= 150) cirrhosis. Median follow-up was 36.3 (IQR 16.9-61.0) and 30.7 (IQR 13.1-52.2) months, respectively. After covariate balancing, compared to cNSBBs, carvedilol significantly reduced the risk of a first decompensation in compensated patients (subdistribution hazard ratio 0.61; 95% CI 0.41-0.92; p\u00a0= 0.019) and a combined endpoint of further decompensation\/death in decompensated patients (subdistribution hazard ratio 0.57; 95% CI 0.42-0.77; p <0.0001). A second HVPG was conducted on 176 (68.8%, compensated) and 177 (62.3%, decompensated) patients. Acute non-responders, both compensated (11.1% vs. 29.4%; p\u00a0= 0.422) and decompensated (16.0% vs. 43.6%: p\u00a0= 0.0247) patients, showed a higher likelihood of achieving a chronic hemodynamic response with carvedilol. The safety profile of each type of NSBB was comparable in both cohorts. Our data endorse the current recommendation favoring the use of carvedilol for the prevention of a first decompensation of cirrhosis and suggest extending the recommendation to patients with decompensated cirrhosis without recurrent or refractory ascites. This study addresses a gap in the comparative effectiveness of classical non-selective beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol and nadolol) vs. carvedilol in managing cirrhosis in both compensated and decompensated stages. Our results support the preferential use of carvedilol in both settings due to its superior efficacy in reducing first and further decompensation. However, owing to the retrospective nature of the study and inherent selection biases, we advise against broadly applying these findings to patients with decompensated cirrhosis who exhibit signs of circulatory dysfunction or recurrent\/refractory ascites.","294":"Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is suspected by clinical characteristics involving fatal arrhythmic events in childhood and adolescence. On the other hand, genetic testing is also important because the mutation site in the specific genes of CPVT is related to the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and gene penetrance. We present a case of a 15-year-old male with a familial history of CPVT and a history of syncope at the age of 5. He experienced a cardiac arrest prompting out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and his circulatory dynamics recovered. Multiple premature ventricular contractions inducted by a treadmill exercise test disappeared after a dosage of verapamil, flecainide, and nadolol, and a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator was implanted. The novel pathogenic mutation with an insertion of histidine near the C-terminus of the RYR2 protein was identified by genetic testing in this case and his mother. The RYR2 mutation in this case has not been previously reported and may be an intractable phenotype of CPVT associated with a strong familial history and fatal cardiac events even under adequate medical therapy.","295":"In this case report, we present a 24-year-old woman with a previous diagnosis of epilepsy who was admitted to the hospital following loss of consciousness (LOC). It was initially assumed that this was an epileptic seizure based on her previous diagnosis of epilepsy; however, a review of her electrocardiograms (ECGs) revealed a prolonged QT interval. She was admitted to the cardiology ward for continuous ECG monitoring and subsequently developed self-limiting torsades de pointes (TDP). A diagnosis of congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) was established, her anticonvulsant treatment was withdrawn, and she was managed with nadolol, mexiletine, and an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).\u00a0This case underscores the importance of excluding cardiac disease with secondary anoxic seizures in patients with apparent epilepsy and in particular the need for all patients to have a baseline 12-lead ECG as part of their initial assessment.","296":"Atypical sensory reactivity is a cardinal presentation in autism. Within the tactile domain, atypical tactile reactivity (TR) is common, it emerges early, persists into adulthood, and impedes social interaction and daily functioning. Hence, atypical TR is a key target for biological intervention to improve outcomes. Brain mechanisms informing biological interventions for atypical TR remains elusive. We previously reported hyper-plasticity in the motor cortex in autistic adults and found that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), designed to strengthen inhibitory processes in the brain, reduced hyper-plasticity. Whether the primary sensory cortex (S1) is characterized by hyper-plasticity, which may underlie atypical TR in autism is unknown. We aim to test whether hyper-plasticity in the S1 underlies atypical TR in autism, and investigate if a single session of rTMS can safely reduce hyper-plasticity in S1 in autistic adults. Plasticity will be assessed in the left S1 with integrated paired associative stimulation and electroencephalography (PAS-EEG) paradigm in 32 autistic adults and 32 age-, sex-, and intelligence quotient-matched controls. Autistic participants will be further randomized (double-blind, 1:1) to receive a single-session of either sham or active 20 Hz bilateral rTMS over the S1 and the plasticity will be re-assessed over the left S1 on the same day. Atypical TR has been identified as one of the top clinical research priorities that can influence outcome in autistic population. The study findings can be highly valuable to further elucidate the mechanism underlying atypical TR, which in turn can help with developing a mechanism-driven intervention.","297":"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation tool with potential for broad application in individuals with neuropsychiatric conditions. As in adults, most rTMS research in youth has focused on treatment-resistant depression. A limited number of rTMS studies have also been conducted in children and youth with primary diagnoses of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or Tourette's syndrome. Across the available rTMS literature, rTMS appears to be well tolerated with few adverse effects reported when applied to child and youth research samples. However, the potential efficacy of rTMS treatment for a variety of targets in children and youth remains unclear, due in part to limitations of the current literature, including studies using diverse protocols, potential for bias in existing clinical trial designs, variability in the research samples, and the use of heterogenous outcome measures. While rTMS is unlikely to take the place of more accessible treatments (e.g., psychopharmacological, psychosocial, psychotherapeutic), rTMS may provide a valuable alternative treatment option, particularly for those individuals where conventional treatments are inaccessible, poorly tolerated, or ineffective. A more robust body of well-designed, controlled trials, is needed in order to clarify rTMS treatment efficacy across relevant neuropsychiatric conditions, optimize treatment protocols, and meet the critical need for novel mental health interventions in children and youth.","298":"Altered excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission has been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Interventions using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to enhance or inhibit cortical excitability are under study for various targets, though the mechanistic effects of rTMS have yet to be examined in ASD. Here, we examined whether an excitatory rTMS treatment course modulates glutamatergic (Glx) or \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) metabolite levels in emerging adults with ASD. Twenty-eight participants with ASD and executive function impairment [23.3 \u00b1 4.69 years; seven-female] underwent two magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) scans of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). MRS scans were acquired before and after participants with ASD were randomized to receive a 20-session course of active or sham rTMS to the DLPFC. Baseline MRS data was available for 19 typically developing controls [23.8 \u00b1 4.47 years; six-female]. Metabolite levels for Glx and GABA+ were compared between ASD and control groups, at baseline, and metabolite level change, pre-to-post-rTMS treatment, was compared in ASD participants that underwent active vs. sham rTMS. Absolute change in Glx was greater in the active vs. sham-rTMS group [<i>F<\/i> <sub>(1,<\/sub> <sub>19)<\/sub> = 6.54, <i>p<\/i> = 0.02], though the absolute change in GABA+ did not differ between groups. We also examined how baseline metabolite levels related to pre\/post-rTMS metabolite level change, in the active vs. sham groups. rTMS group moderated the relation between baseline Glx and pre-to-post-rTMS Glx change, such that baseline Glx predicted Glx change in the active-rTMS group only [<i>b<\/i> = 1.52, <i>SE<\/i> = 0.32, <i>t<\/i> <sub>(18)<\/sub> = 4.74, <i>p<\/i> < 0.001]; Glx levels increased when baseline levels were lower, and decreased when baseline levels were higher. Our results indicate that an interventional course of excitatory rTMS to the DLPFC may modulate local Glx levels in emerging adults with ASD, and align with prior reports of glutamatergic alterations following rTMS. Interventional studies that track glutamatergic markers may provide mechanistic insights into the therapeutic potential of rTMS in ASD. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:<\/b> Clinicaltrials.gov (ID: NCT02311751), https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/NCT02311751?term=ameis&rank=1; NCT02311751.","299":"Emerging evidence implicates atypical plasticity in the neurophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Specifically, autistic people demonstrated hyperplasticity in response to theta-burst stimulation (TBS). We hypothesized that autistic adults would display hyperplasticity to TBS and that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) - which potentiates brain inhibitory mechanisms - would 'stabilize' hyperplasticity. Using a randomized, cross-over design, plasticity was assessed using TBS in the left motor cortex (M1) in 31 autistic adults and 30 sex-, intelligence quotient-, and age-matched controls. Autistic adults (n\u202f=\u202f29) were further randomized (1:1) to receive a single session of active (n\u202f=\u202f14) or sham (n\u202f=\u202f15) rTMS (6000 pulses at 20\u202fHz) over left M1 and plasticity was reassessed on the next day following rTMS. Both long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) were significantly increased in the ASD group, indicating hyperplasticity. Active, but not sham rTMS, attenuated LTD in autistic adults. We provided further evidence for the presence of brain hyperplasticity in ASD. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show preliminary evidence that an excessive LTD in ASD can be 'stabilized' using rTMS. Such 'stabilizing' effect of rTMS on LTP was not observed, likely due to small sample size or a more specific 'attenuating' effect of rTMS on LTD, compared to LTP. These findings indicate atypical brain inhibitory mechanisms behind hyperplasticity in ASD. Utilizing a larger sample, future replication studies could investigate therapeutic opportunities of 'mechanism-driven' rTMS.","300":"In youth and young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), executive function (EF) deficits may be a promising treatment target with potential impact on everyday functioning. To conduct a pilot randomized, double-blind, parallel, controlled trial evaluating repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for EF deficits in ASD. In Toronto, Ontario (November 2014 to June 2017), a 20-session, 4-week course of 20\u00a0Hz rTMS targeting dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (90%RMT) was compared to sham stimulation in 16-35 year-olds with ASD (28 male\/12 female), without intellectual disability, who had impaired everyday EF performance (n\u00a0=\u00a020 active\/n\u00a0=\u00a020 sham). Outcome measures evaluated protocol feasibility and clinical effects of active vs. sham rTMS on EF performance. The moderating effect of baseline functioning was explored. Of eligible participants, 95% were enrolled and 95% of randomized participants completed the protocol. Adverse events across treatment arms were mild-to-moderate. There was no significant difference between active vs. sham rTMS on EF performance. Baseline adaptive functioning moderated the effect of rTMS, such that participants with lower baseline functioning experienced significant EF improvement in the active vs. sham group. Our pilot RCT demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of using high frequency rTMS targeting DLPFC in youth and young adults with autism. No evidence for efficacy of active versus sham rTMS on EF performance was found. However, we found promising preliminary evidence of EF performance improvement following active versus sham rTMS in participants with ASD with more severe adaptive functioning deficits. Future work could focus on examining efficacy of rTMS in this higher-need population.

We recruited 34 healthy adolescents (aged 13-19, 13 males, 21 females). To evaluate excitatory plasticity, we compared mean motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) before and after PAS at 0, 15, and 30\u2009min. To evaluate inhibitory plasticity, we evaluated the cortical silent period (CSP) elicited by single-pulse TMS in the contracted hand before and after PAS at 0, 15, and 30\u2009min. All participants completed PAS procedures. No adverse events occurred. PAS was well tolerated. PAS-induced significant increases in the ratio of post-PAS MEP to pre-PAS MEP amplitudes (<i>p<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.01) at all post-PAS intervals. Neither socioeconomic status nor sex was associated with post-PAS MEP changes. PAS induced significant CSP lengthening in males but not females. PAS is a feasible, safe, and well-tolerated index of adolescent motor cortical plasticity. Gender may influence PAS-induced changes in cortical inhibition. PAS is safe and well tolerated by healthy adolescents and may be a novel tool with which to study adolescent neuroplasticity.","302":"Executive function (EF) deficits in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are ubiquitous and understudied. Further, there are no effective, neuroscience-based treatments to address this impairing feature of ASD. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has demonstrated promise in addressing EF deficits in adult neuropsychiatric disorders. This article will outline the design of a novel randomized-controlled trial of bilateral, 20\u2009Hz, rTMS applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for treatment of EF deficits in ASD that is currently ongoing. We describe prior therapeutic rTMS research for ASD and prior rTMS trials targeting EFs in adult neuropsychiatric disorders. A neurophysiological rationale for rTMS treatment of EF deficits in ASD is presented. An ongoing protocol will enroll participants aged 16-35 with ASD and no intellectual disability. Psychotropic medications will be continued during the 4-week trial of active 20\u2009Hz versus sham rTMS applied to the DLPFC. Twenty, active treatment sessions consisting of 25 stimulation trains at a 90% motor threshold will be administered. The primary outcome measure is the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) spatial working memory task. At present, recruitment, enrollment, and treatment within the described clinical trial are ongoing. EF deficits are common and impairing symptoms of ASD. There are no evidence-based treatments for EF deficits in ASD. The protocol described here will provide important preliminary data on the feasibility and efficacy of 20\u2009Hz rTMS to DLPFC for EF deficits in ASD.","303":"<b>Introduction<\/b>: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) research has suggested dysfunction in cortical glutamatergic systems in adolescent depression, while proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1<\/sup>H-MRS) studies have demonstrated deficits in concentrations of glutamatergic metabolites in depressed individuals in several cortical regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). However, few studies have combined TMS and MRS methods to examine relationships between glutamatergic neurochemistry and excitatory and inhibitory neural functions, and none have utilized TMS-MRS methodology in clinical populations or in youth. This exploratory study aimed to examine relationships between TMS measures of cortical excitability and inhibition and concentrations of glutamatergic metabolites as measured by <sup>1<\/sup>H-MRS in depressed adolescents. <b>Methods<\/b>: Twenty-four adolescents (aged 11-18 years) with depressive symptoms underwent TMS testing, which included measures of the resting motor threshold (RMT), cortical silent period (CSP), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF). Fourteen participants from the same sample also completed <sup>1<\/sup>H-MRS in a 3 T MRI scanner after TMS testing. Glutamate + glutamine (Glx) concentrations were measured in medial ACC and left primary motor cortex voxels with a TE-optimized PRESS sequence. Metabolite concentrations were corrected for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after tissue segmentation. Pearson product-moment and Spearman rank-order correlations were calculated to assess relationships between TMS measures and [Glx]. <b>Results<\/b>: In the left primary motor cortex voxel, [Glx] had a significant positive correlation with the RMT. In the medial ACC voxel, [Glx] had significant positive correlations with ICF at the 10-ms and 20-ms interstimulus intervals (ISIs). <b>Conclusion<\/b>: These preliminary data implicate glutamate in cortical excitatory processes measured by TMS. Limitations included small sample size, lack of healthy control comparators, possible age- and sex-related effects, and observational nature of the study. Further research aimed at examining the relationship between glutamatergic metabolite concentrations measured through MRS and the excitatory and inhibitory physiology measured through TMS is warranted. Combined TMS-MRS methods show promise for future investigations of the pathophysiology of depression in adults as well as in children and adolescents.","304":"Neurophysiologic correlates of depression severity potentially have great utility in diagnosis and treatment planning. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) measures of cortical inhibition and excitability have shown promise as biomarkers in psychiatry, but no prior work has examined correlates of illness severity in pediatric mood disorders. This study sought to examine the relationship between depression severity and TMS measures of cortical inhibition and excitability in children and adolescents. Twenty-four depressed and 22 healthy control youth underwent TMS testing (cortical silent period [CSP], short-interval intracortical inhibition at 2-ms and 4-ms interstimulus intervals (ISIs) [SICI-2,-4], resting motor threshold [RMT] and intracortical facilitation at 10-, 15-, and 20-ms ISIs [ICF-10,-15,-20]). Symptom severity was assessed with the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-A17-SR) and the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R). In the overall sample, the following significant negative correlations were observed: CDRS-R and CSP (right hemisphere, \u03c1=-0.35, p=0.021); QIDS-A17-SR and CSP (left, \u03c1=-0.33, p=0.031; right, \u03c1=-0.42, p=0.004); and CDRS-R and SICI-4 (right, \u03c1=-0.30, p=0.042). Among healthy control participants, additional significant negative correlations were observed between QIDS-A17-SR and right ICF-10; QIDS-A17-SR and right ICF-15; and QIDS-A17-SR and left ICF-20. Among depressed participants, significant negative correlations were observed between QIDS-A17-SR and bilateral CSP; CDRS-R and bilateral ICF-10; CDRS-R and bilateral ICF-15; QIDS-A17-SR and left ICF-10; and QIDS-A17-SR and bilateral ICF-15.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has rapidly evolved to become a widely used, safe, and non-invasive neuroscientific tool to investigate a variety of neurophysiological processes, including neuroplasticity. The diagnostic and therapeutic potential of TMS in ASD is beginning to be realized.

Among associated symptoms of ASD, management of irritability has gained considerable attention as it complicates adjustment of ASD patients and thus necessitates its pharmacological treatment. Resveratrol is a plant phytoalexin, which has been demonstrated to have neuroprotective effects through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial was designed to assess the potential therapeutic effects of resveratrol plus risperidone on irritability of ASD patients. Sixty-two patients were assigned randomly into two groups of resveratrol and placebo. Both groups were treated with risperidone twice daily starting at a dose of 0.5\u00a0mg with a dose increase of 0.5\u00a0mg per week (for the first 3\u00a0weeks). Resveratrol dosage was 250\u00a0mg twice per day from the beginning of the study. Using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C), patients were assessed for ASD-related behavioural symptoms at baseline, week 5 and week 10. The frequency of adverse events was recorded using a checklist containing 25 possible side effects, including general, gastrointestinal, neurological and cardiovascular complications. Improvements in primary outcome measure (irritability) and three secondary outcome measures (lethargy\/social withdrawal, stereotypic behaviour and inappropriate speech subscales) in the resveratrol group were statistically similar to those in the placebo group. The repeated measures analysis showed no time\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0treatment interaction on these subscale scores. In contrast, patients in the resveratrol group showed greater decline in hyperactivity\/non-compliance score as a secondary outcome measure (mean difference [CI\u00a0=\u00a095%]\u00a0=\u00a04.51 [0.10-8.92], t\u00a0=\u00a02.04; P\u00a0=\u00a0.04), and repeated measures analysis showed significant effect for time\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0treatment effect on this subscale score (F\u00a0=\u00a03.81; df\u00a0=\u00a01.30; P\u00a0=\u00a0.043). There was no significant difference in number and severity of adverse events between the two groups.

Riluzole is hypothesized to have an inhibitory effect on glutamate release, block excitotoxic effects of glutamate, and potentiate postsynaptic GABA(A) receptor function. Extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) activation is known to be delayed in humans with FXS and knockout animal models of FXS. Correction of delayed ERK activation is a potential biomarker of treatment response in FXS. We conducted a six-week open-label prospective pilot study of riluzole (100 mg\/day) in six adults with FXS. Riluzole was started at 50mg every evening and then increased to 50mg twice daily at week 2. The dose was kept constant for the final 4 weeks of the trial. Clinical response was determined by a score of 1 \"very much improved\" or 2 \"much improved\" on the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement (CGI-I) scale and a\u226525% improvement on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for Pervasive Developmental Disorders. The primary target of treatment in this study was repetitive, compulsive behavior that commonly occurs in persons with FXS. The study incorporated an ERK activation biomarker assay. Potential adverse effects were assessed in a systematic manner at all clinic visits and by phone between visits. Riluzole treatment was associated with clinical response in 1 of 6 subjects (17%). Among a number of secondary outcome measures employed, significant improvement was only noted on the ADHD Rating Scale-IV (became non-significant when corrected for multiple comparisons).

Riluzole is a glutamate-modulating agent with neuroprotective properties, which has been shown to have positive effects in many neuropsychiatric disorders. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of riluzole as an adjunctive to risperidone in the treatment of irritability in autistic children who were not optimally responding to previous medications. This was a 10-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial. The study enrolled male and female outpatients aged 5-12\u00a0years with a diagnosis of autistic disorder based on the DSM-IV-TR criteria and a score of \u226512 on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) irritability subscale who had discontinued other medications because of a lack of efficacy. Subjects received riluzole (titrated to 50 or 100\u00a0mg\/day based on bodyweight) or placebo in addition to risperidone (titrated up to 2 or 3\u00a0mg\/day based on bodyweight) for 10\u00a0weeks. Patients were assessed at baseline, week 5, and week 10. The primary outcome measure was the difference in the change in the ABC-C irritability subscale score from baseline to week 10 between the two groups. We also compared changes in other ABC-C subscale scores and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale scores between the two groups. Forty-nine patients were enrolled in the study, and forty children completed the trial (dropouts: placebo\u00a0=\u00a04, riluzole\u00a0=\u00a05). A significantly greater improvement in the study primary outcome (the ABC-C irritability subscale score) was achieved by the riluzole-treated children compared with the placebo group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Patients in the riluzole group also showed significantly greater improvement on the lethargy\/social withdrawal (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02), stereotypic behavior (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03), and hyperactivity\/non-compliance subscales (P\u00a0=\u00a00.005), but not on the inappropriate speech subscale (P\u00a0=\u00a00.20) than patients in the placebo group.

Children in the riluzole group experienced significantly more increases in their appetite and bodyweight than children in the placebo group by the end of the study. Riluzole add-on therapy shows several therapeutic outcomes, particularly for improving irritability, in children with autism.

Our aims were (1) to evaluate demographic and clinical characteristics as predictors of parent attendance and engagement in PT and (2) to examine the associations of parent attendance and engagement in PT with study-targeted child behavior outcomes (i.e., attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] and disruptive behavior symptoms). TOSCA was a randomized clinical trial evaluating the effect of placebo versus risperidone when added to PT and psychostimulant for childhood ADHD with severe aggression. Data for 167 parents and children 6-12 years old with ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) or conduct disorder, and severe physical aggression were examined. Analyses used generalized linear models. Most parents (72%) attended seven or more of nine sessions. The average parental engagement, that is, the percentage of PT elements fully achieved across participants and sessions, was 85%. The average therapist rating of goal completion was 92%. Parents of non-white and\/or Hispanic children (p\u2009=\u20090.01) and children with lower intelligence quotient (p\u2009=\u20090.02) had lower PT attendance; parents with lower family incomes (p\u2009=\u20090.01) were less engaged. Attendance and engagement predicted better scores on the primary child behavior outcomes of disruptive behavior (Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form Disruptive Behavior Total) and ADHD and ODD symptoms, adjusting for baseline severity. When the clinical picture is sufficiently severe to warrant prescribing an atypical antipsychotic, PT is feasible for families of children with ADHD and co-occurring severe aggression. The promotion of attendance and engagement in PT is important to enhance clinical outcomes among this challenging population. Methods for overcoming barriers to participation in PT deserve vigorous investigation, particularly for those with low family income, non-white race, Hispanic ethnicity, or when children have lower cognitive level.","313":"The Treatment of Severe Childhood Aggression (TOSCA) project examined augmentation of stimulant treatment and parent training (PT) with risperidone for severe physical aggression. This article summarizes the clinical implications; reanalyzes the data to examine the utility of 4 criteria for deciding to augment; and presents a treatment algorithm. The newly analyzed 4 criteria for augmenting after 3 weeks of stimulant and PT treatment consisted of not meeting a Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) score of 1 and a normal score (\u226415) on the Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form Disruptive-Total (D-Total); a CGI-I score of 1 or 2 plus 25% improvement in D-Total score; a D-Total score no higher than 15; and a CGI-Severity score of 3 (mild) or better. Effect sizes were calculated. Prior TOSCA publications were reviewed for clinically relevant findings. All 4 criteria resulted in medium or better effect sizes (d\u00a0= 0.59-0.72) when comparing risperidone with placebo. Providing risperidone to children who did not reach a CGI-I score of 1 plus a D-Total score no higher than 15 resulted in the greatest benefit. In addition, a review of clinically relevant data suggests that stimulant plus PT shows further improvement after 3 weeks even without augmentation. For those children who did not attain a CGI-I score of 1 and a D-total score no higher than 15, adding risperidone maximized the number of children benefitting from treatment and the average amount of benefit. Unless clinical circumstances dictate otherwise, practitioners should delay an antipsychotic drug for at least 1 month after the optimal stimulant dose is achieved and PT has commenced.

Within the autism spectrum disorder sample, obesity was associated with minority status and lower daily living skills. These findings suggest that children with autism spectrum disorder and disruptive behavior are at increased risk for obesity and underscore the need for weight management interventions in this population.","315":"Previous \"Treatment of Severe Childhood Aggression\" (TOSCA) reports demonstrated that many children with severe physical aggression and attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) responded well to two randomized treatments (parent training [PT]+stimulant+placebo\u2009=\u2009Basic vs. PT+stimulant+risperidone\u2009=\u2009Augmented) for 9 weeks. An important clinical question is whether these favorable outcomes are maintained over longer times. Clinical responders to the 9-week trial (n\u2009=\u2009103\/168), defined as Clinical Global Impressions (CGI)-Improvement of much\/very much improved plus substantial reduction in parent ratings of disruptiveness, were followed another 12 weeks (21 weeks total) while remaining on blinded treatment. Outcome measures included Clinical Global Impressions scale, Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form (NCBRF), other parent\/teacher-rated scales, laboratory tests, clinician ratings of abnormal movement, and other adverse events (AEs). Parent ratings of problem behavior showed minimal worsening of behavior from end of the 9-week acute trial (expected from regression to the mean after selecting best responders), but outcomes at Extension endpoint were meaningfully improved compared with acute study baseline. As expected, outcomes for Basic and Augmented treatment did not differ among these children selected for good clinical response. During Extension, more Augmented subjects had elevated prolactin; there were no clinically confirmed cases of tardive dyskinesia. Delayed sleep onset was the most frequent Basic AE. We also conducted a last-observation-carried-forward analysis, which included both nonresponders and responders. We found that, at the end of Extension, Augmented subjects had more improvement than Basic subjects on the NCBRF Positive Social subscale (p\u2009=\u20090.005; d\u2009=\u20090.44), the Antisocial Behavior Scale Reactive Aggression subscale (p\u2009=\u20090.03; d\u2009=\u20090.36), and marginally so on the Disruptive Behavior Total subscale (p\u2009=\u20090.058; d\u2009=\u20090.29, the primary outcome). The medium-term outcomes were good for the participants in both treatment groups, perhaps because they were selected for good response. When nonresponders were included in ITT analyses, there was some indication that Augmented surpassed Basic treatment.","316":"Risperidone is approved for the treatment of serious behavioral problems in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This study examined the effects of risperidone on cardiac conduction in children with ASD. Data were collected from an 8-week, five-site trial conducted by the Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology Autism Network. Children (age 5-17 years) were randomly assigned to risperidone (n\u2009=\u200949) or placebo (n\u2009=\u200952) under double-blind conditions. Risperidone was superior to placebo in reducing serious behavioral problems. A standard 12-lead, electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained in most subjects at screening and week 8. A pediatric electrophysiologist blind to treatment assignment reviewed all available ECGs for readability, abnormalities, and cardiac conduction parameters, including QTc. The electrophysiologist measurements were compared to machine readings. A second blinded electrophysiologist examined all available ECGs for abnormalities and a 20% random sample for QTc. Of the 101 randomized subjects in the trial, complete pretreatment and week 8 data were available on 65 subjects (placebo n\u2009=\u200930; risperidone n\u2009=\u200935). The electrophysiologist did not identify any cardiac conduction adverse effects of risperidone and there was no difference in mean change on the QTc compared to placebo. The Bland-Altman plot showed a systematic bias in QTc measurements by the electrophysiologist and machine. Machine readings produced higher values than the electrophysiologist for shorter QTc intervals and machine scoring was lower than electrophysiologist readings for longer QTc values (p\u2009=\u20090.001). Two electrophysiologists had overall percent agreements of 82.9% (95% CI: 76.3 to 89.6) on qualitative assessment and 88.6% (95% CI: 79.3 to 98.0) on QTc interval. Using conventional doses during acute treatment in children with ASD and serious behavioral problems, there was no difference in the mean change in QTc between risperidone and placebo.

Almost two-thirds (n\u00a0= 108; 64%) of families in the 9-week study participated in week 52 follow-ups (Basic, n\u00a0= 55; Augmented, n\u00a0= 53) and were representative of the initial study sample. The assessment battery included caregiver and clinician ratings and laboratory tests. Only 43% of participants in the Augmented group and 36% in the Basic group still adhered to their assigned regimen (not significant [NS]); 23% of those in the Augmented group and 11% in the Basic group were taking no medication (NS). Both randomized groups improved baseline to follow-up, but the 3 primary parent-reported behavioral outcomes showed no significant between-group differences. Exploratory analyses indicated that participants in the Augmented group (65%) were more likely (p\u00a0= .02) to have a Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) severity score of 1 to 3 (i.e., normal to mildly ill) at follow-up than those in the Basic group (42%). Parents rated 45% of children as impaired often or very often from ADHD, noncompliant, or aggressive behavior. The Augmented group had elevated prolactin levels, and the Basic group had decreased weight over time. Findings were generally similar whether groups were defined by randomized assignment or follow-up treatment status. Both treatment strategies were associated with clinical improvement at follow-up, and primary behavioral outcomes did not differ significantly. Many children evidenced lingering mental health concerns, suggesting the need for additional research into more effective interventions.

This was a 24-week, multisite, randomized trial of risperidone only versus risperidone plus parent training in 124 children (mean age 6.9 \u00b1 2.35 years; 105 boys and 19 girls) with ASD and serious behavioral problems. We monitored height, weight, waist circumference, and adverse effects during the trial. Fasting blood samples were obtained before treatment and at week\u00a016. In 97 children with a mean of 22.9 \u00b1 2.8 weeks of risperidone exposure, there was a 5.4 \u00b1 3.4 kg weight gain over 24 weeks (p\u00a0< .0001); waist circumference increased from 60.7 \u00b1 10.4 cm to 66.8 \u00b1 11.3 cm (p\u00a0< .0001). At baseline, 59 of 97 children (60.8%) were classified as having normal weight; by week 24, only 25 of 85 (29.4%) remained in that group. Growth curve analysis showed a significant change in body mass index (BMI) z scores from pretreatment to week 24 (p\u00a0< .0001). This effect was significantly greater for children with reported increased appetite in the first 8 weeks. From before treatment to week 16, there were significant increases in glucose (p\u00a0=\u00a0.02), hemoglobin A1c (p\u00a0= .01), insulin (p\u00a0<.0001), homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; p\u00a0< .001), alanine aminotransferase (p\u00a0= .01), and leptin (p\u00a0< .0001). Adiponectin declined (p\u00a0= .003). At baseline, 7 children met conventional criteria for metabolic syndrome; by week 16, 12 additional children were so classified. Rapid weight gain with risperidone treatment may promote the cascade of biochemical indices associated with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Appetite, weight, waist circumference, liver function tests, blood lipids, and glucose warrant monitoring.

Using longitudinal data, we examined the association between changes in weight following risperidone initiation or discontinuation and ferritin concentration. Study 1: Between April 2004 and September 2007, participants were enrolled from outpatient settings in a prospective randomized clinical trial comparing the efficacy of risperidone monotherapy to the combination of risperidone and behavior therapy in targeting disruptive behavior in 4- to 13-year-old children with DSM-IV-TR-based autism spectrum disorder. Study 2: Medically healthy 7- to 17-year-old participants in long-term open-label risperidone treatment at study entry returned for follow-up 1.5 years later, between July 2007 and July 2011. Available blood samples were used to measure ferritin. Linear multivariable regression analysis tested the association between ferritin concentration and change in age-sex-specific body mass index (BMI) z score between study entry and endpoint, adjusting for relevant confounders. Study 1 sample consisted of 73 participants (85% males, mean age: 7.7 \u00b1 2.4 years). After 18.0 \u00b1 2.0 weeks on risperidone, their BMI z score increased by 0.93 \u00b1 0.70 points and ferritin concentration declined by 6.8 \u00b1 13.3 \u03bcg\/L. After adjusting for age and sex, change in BMI z score was inversely correlated with percent change in ferritin concentration (\u03b2 = -18.3, P < .003). Study 2 participants had all been receiving risperidone at study entry. At follow-up, 1.5 \u00b1 0.3 years later, risperidone was discontinued in 26 of the 96 who were included in the analysis. Neither change in BMI z score nor in ferritin concentration was different between those who continued versus discontinued risperidone. However, a reduction in BMI z score between study entry and follow-up was associated with higher ferritin concentration at follow-up in participants who discontinued risperidone compared to those who continued it (P = .01). Risperidone-related weight gain is associated with a reduction in body iron reserves, which appears to improve with weight loss following risperidone discontinuation. Preliminary evidence suggests that risperidone may also directly inhibit iron absorption. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00080145.","321":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of risperidone in treating irritability and related behaviors in children and adolescents with autistic disorders. In this 6 month (26 week) open-label extension (OLE) study, patients (5-17 years of age, who completed the previous fixed-dose, 6 week, double-blind [DB] phase) were flexibly dosed with risperidone based on body weight. The maximum allowed dose was 1.25 mg\/day for those weighing 20 to <45 kg, and 1.75 mg\/day for those weighing \u2265 45 kg. The study primarily assessed risperidone's safety; efficacy was assessed as a secondary end-point. Fifty-six (71%) out of 79 enrolled patients completed the OLE; the most common discontinuations were for insufficient response (7 [9%]) or adverse events (AE) (5 [6%]). The most common (\u2265 5% frequency in the total group) AEs were increased appetite (11% [n=9]); increased weight and vomiting (9% [n=7] each); sedation, pyrexia, and upper respiratory tract infection (8% [n=6] each); nasopharyngitis (6% [n=5]); and somnolence and fatigue (5% [n=4] each). Extrapyramidal AEs were reported in 6 (8%) patients. Increase in mean weight (11-15%) and body mass index (5-10%) occurred; one patient discontinued because of weight increase. One potentially prolactin-related AE (irregular menstruation) was reported. The risperidone high-dose group had the greatest mean improvement in sleep visual analog scale (24.6). All groups showed additional improvement in efficacy scale scores during the OLE. During this OLE, safety findings with risperidone treatment (maximum weight-based dose of 1.25 mg\/day or 1.75 mg\/day) were consistent with those observed in the DB phase, and with the current safety information for risperidone in autistic, psychiatric, and behavioral disorders. Patients experienced some additional improvement in irritability and related behaviors. This phase-4 study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00576732).","322":"A post hoc analysis of the risperidone (RIS)\/paliperidone (Pali) clinical trials database comprising 64 studies was conducted. Risk of sudden death, cardiovascular (CV), and cerebrovascular events during RIS or Pali treatment was estimated. Treatment emergent CV adverse events were identified using 7 prespecified Standardised MedDRA Queries as follows: embolic\/thrombotic events, cerebrovascular disorders, ischemic heart disease, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, torsades\/QT prolongation, and convulsions. Risk in the RIS\/Pali pooled group was significantly increased compared to placebo for the following adverse events: syncope, tachycardia, palpitations, edema peripheral, dysarthria, and transient ischemic attack. Incidence of death related to CV events was low and similar across groups. Consistent with the known pharmacologic profile and product information, this analysis of treatment emergent adverse event data from a large, randomized, controlled clinical trials database described increased risk versus placebo for several specific CV events. Apart from events described in existing product labeling, no new safety findings emerged.","323":"Efficacy and safety of 2 risperidone doses were evaluated in children and adolescents with autism. Patients (N\u00a0=\u00a096; 5-17\u00a0years), received risperidone (low-dose: 0.125\u00a0mg\/day [20 to <45\u00a0kg], 0.175\u00a0mg\/day [>45\u00a0kg] or high-dose: 1.25\u00a0mg\/day [20 to <45\u00a0kg], 1.75\u00a0mg\/day [>45\u00a0kg]) or placebo. Mean baseline (range 27-29) to endpoint change in Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability (primary endpoint) was significantly greater in the high-dose-(-12.4 [6.5]; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), but not low-dose (-7.4 [8.1]; p\u00a0=\u00a00.164) group, versus placebo (-3.5 [10.7]). Clinical Global Impressions-Severity and Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale scores improved significantly only in the high-dose group, consistent with ABC-I results. Somnolence, sedation and increased appetite occurred more frequently in high-versus low-dose groups. Overall, increased appetite occurred most frequently.","324":"Long-acting injectable (LAI) formulations of antipsychotics are valuable treatment alternatives for patients with psychotic disorders, and understanding their safe use is critical. Post-injection delirium\/sedation syndrome (PDSS) has been reported following treatment with one atypical antipsychotic LAI. Clinical databases of risperidone LAI and paliperidone palmitate were explored to identify if cases of PDSS had been observed. No cases of PDSS were identified in 15 completed trials of 3,164 subjects (approximately 115,000 injections) or the postmarketing safety database of risperidone LAI. Only one case of PDSS was identified among 10 completed trials (3,817 subjects, 33,906 injections) of paliperidone palmitate-that case having been reported in a patient randomized to treatment with placebo. Examination of these prospective databases finds no evidence that risperidone LAI and paliperidone palmitate are associated with PDSS and suggest that findings seen with another antipsychotic LAI are not generalizable.","325":"Risperidone has demonstrated efficacy for acute (8 week) and intermediate length (6 month) management of severe irritability and aggression in children and adolescents with autism. Less is known about the long-term effects of risperidone exposure in this population. We examined the tolerability, safety, and therapeutic benefit of risperidone exposure over a 1-2 year follow-up period. In a naturalistic study, 84 children and adolescents 5-17 years of age (from an original sample of 101) were assessed an average of 21.4 months after initial entry into a placebo-controlled 8 week trial of risperidone for children and adolescents with autism and severe irritability. They were assessed at baseline and at follow-up on safety and tolerability measures (blood, urinalysis, electrocardiogram [ECG], medical history, vital signs, neurological symptoms, other adverse events), developmental measures (adaptive behavior, intelligence quotient [IQ]), and standardized rating instruments. Treatment over the follow-up period, after completion of protocol participation, was uncontrolled. Statistical analyses assessed outcome over time with or without prolonged risperidone therapy. Two-thirds of the 84 subjects continued to receive risperidone (mean 2.47\u2009mg\/day, S.D. 1.29\u2009mg). At follow-up, risperidone was associated with more enuresis, more excessive appetite, and more weight gain, but not more adverse neurological effects. No clinically significant events were noted on blood counts, chemistries, urinalysis, ECG, or interim medical history. Regardless of drug condition at follow-up, there was considerable improvement in maladaptive behavior compared with baseline, including core symptoms associated with autism. Height and weight gains were elevated with risperidone. Social skills on Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS) improved with risperidone. Parent-rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) Irritability subscale scores were reduced in those taking risperidone at follow-up. Several other measures of maladaptive behavior (some related to socialization) also showed improved functioning in association with risperidone on the ABC or on the Modified Real Life Rating Scale. Increased appetite, weight gain, and enuresis are risks associated with long-term risperidone. Our data suggest that these risks were balanced by longer-term behavioral and social benefits for many children over 1.8 years of ongoing treatment.","326":"Repetitive behavior is a core feature of autism spectrum disorder. We used 8-week data from two federally funded, multi-site, randomized trials with risperidone conducted by the Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology Autism Network to evaluate the sensitivity of the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for autism spectrum disorder to detect change with treatment. Study 1 included 52 subjects assigned to placebo and 49 subjects to risperidone under double-blind conditions. In Study 2, 49 subjects received risperidone only and 75 subjects received risperidone plus parent training. The combined sample consisted of 187 boys and 38 girls (aged 4-17 years). At the medication-free baseline, the internal consistency on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for autism spectrum disorder total score was excellent (Cronbach's alpha = 0.84) and the mean scores were similar across the four groups. Compared to placebo in Study 1, all three active treatment groups showed significant improvement (effect sizes: 0.74-0.88). There were no differences between active treatment groups. These results indicate that the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for autism spectrum disorder has acceptable test-retest as evidenced by the medium to high correlations in the placebo group and demonstrated sensitivity to change with treatment.","327":"This study identified subtypes of aggression in a sample of 206 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who participated in 2 risperidone trials. The narratives were derived from a parent interview about each child's 2 most pressing problems. Five subtypes of aggression emerged: hot aggression only, cold aggression only, self-injurious behavior (SIB) only, aggression and SIB, and nonaggressive. All groups showed a high rate of positive response to risperidone with no differences across subtypes. These study findings extend understanding of aggression in ASD and may be useful to guide further study on biological mechanisms and individualized treatment in ASD.","328":"There is growing interest in measuring social disability as a core element of autism spectrum disorders in medication trials. We conducted a secondary analysis on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Social Withdrawal subscale using data from two federally-funded, multi-site, randomized trials with risperidone. Study 1 included 52 subjects assigned to placebo and 49 subjects to risperidone under double-blind conditions. Study 2 included 49 subjects assigned to risperidone only and 75 subjects assigned to risperidone plus parent training. After 8 weeks of treatment, all active treatments were superior to placebo (effect sizes ranging from 0.42 to 0.65). The findings suggest that the Social Withdrawal subscale may be a useful measure of social disability in acute treatment trials.","329":"Risperidone has been shown to improve serious behavioral problems in children with autism. Here we asked whether risperidone-associated improvement was related to changes in concentrations of inflammatory molecules in the serum of these subjects. Seven molecules were identified as worthy of further assessment by performing a pilot analysis of 31 inflammatory markers in 21 medication-free subjects with autism versus 15 healthy controls: epidermal growth factor (EGF), interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), interleukin (IL)-13, IL-17, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), IL-1 and IL-1-receptor antagonist. Serum concentrations of these markers were then established in a different set of subjects that participated in a double-blind, clinical trial and an expanded group of healthy subjects. In the first analysis, samples obtained from subjects with autism at baseline visits were compared to visits after 8-week treatment with placebo (n=37) or risperidone (n=40). The cytokine concentrations remained stable over the 8-week period for both risperidone and placebo groups. In the second analysis, we explored further the differences between medication-free subjects with autism (n=77) and healthy controls (recruited independently; n=19). Serum levels of EGF were elevated in subjects with autism (median=103 pg\/mL, n=75) in comparison to healthy controls (75 pg\/mL, n=19; p<0.05), and levels of IL-13 were decreased in autism (median=0.8 pg\/mL, n=77) in comparison to controls (9.8 pg\/mL, n=19; p=0.0003). These changes did not correlate with standardized measures used for a diagnosis of autism. In summary, risperidone-induced clinical improvement in subjects with autism was not associated with changes in the serum inflammatory markers measured. Whether altered levels of EGF and IL-13 play a role in the pathogenesis or phenotype of autism requires further investigation.","330":"The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology (RUPP) Autism Network found an effect size of d = 1.2 in favor of risperidone on the main outcome measure in an 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial for irritability in autistic disorder. This paper explores moderators and mediators of this effect. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses were conducted with suspected moderators and mediators entered into the regression equations. MacArthur Foundation Network subgroup guidelines were followed in the evaluation of the results. Only baseline severity moderated treatment response: Higher severity showed greater improvement for risperidone but not for placebo. Weight gain mediated treatment response negatively: those who gained more weight improved less with risperidone and more with placebo. Compliance correlated with outcome for risperidone but not placebo. Higher dose correlated with worse outcome for placebo, but not risperidone. Of nonspecific predictors, parent education, family income, and low baseline prolactin positively predicted outcome; anxiety, bipolar symptoms, oppositional-defiant symptoms, stereotypy, and hyperactivity negatively predicted outcome. Risperidone moderated the effect of change in 5'-nucleotidase, a marker of zinc status, for which decrease was associated with improvement only with risperidone, not with placebo. The benefit-risk ratio of risperidone is better with greater symptom severity. Risperidone can be individually titrated to optimal dosage for excellent response in the majority of children. Weight gain is not necessary for risperidone benefit and may even detract from it. Socioeconomic advantage, low prolactin, and absence of co-morbid problems nonspecifically predict better outcome. Mineral interactions with risperidone deserve further study.","331":"The brain serotonin level is decreased in individuals with autism. Buspirone is a 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist with antiaggressive effects increasing prosocial behaviors. We conducted an 8-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial. Participants included 40 outpatient children and adolescents with autism. The patients took buspirone plus risperidone or risperidone plus placebo during 8 weeks. The patients were assessed at baseline, week 4, and week 8 using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Rating Scale. Eighteen patients in the placebo group and 16 patients in the buspirone group completed this trial. The mean dose of buspirone was 6.7 (SD 2.7) mg\/day. Irritability subscale score significantly decreased during this trial in both groups (buspirone group: declined from 25.7 [SD 5.7] to 16.3 [SD 8.5]; placebo group: declined from 24.7 [SD 7.6] to 18.2 [SD 7.7]). The Cohen d effect size was .45. Thirteen (81.2%) of 16 patients in the buspirone group and 7 (38.9%) of 18 patients in the placebo group showed a \u226530% decline in irritability score. The relative risk for treatment was 2.1. There were no serious adverse effects. The most common adverse effects in the buspirone group were increased appetite, drowsiness, and fatigue. This clinical trial supports that low dose buspirone plus risperidone is more effective than risperidone plus placebo for treating irritability in individuals with autism.","332":"This study examined the efficacy and safety of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) augmentation for treating irritability in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Forty children and adolescents met diagnostic criteria for ASD according to DSM-IV. They were randomly allocated into one of the two groups of NAC (1200\u2009mg\/day)+risperidone or placebo+risperidone. NAC and placebo were administered in the form of effervescent and in two divided doses for 8 weeks. Irritability subscale score of Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) was considered as the main outcome measure. Adverse effects were also checked. The mean score of irritability in the NAC+risperidone and placebo+risperidone groups at baseline was 13.2(5.3) and 16.7(7.8), respectively. The scores after 8 weeks were 9.7(4.1) and 15.1(7.8), respectively. Repeated measures of ANOVA showed that there was a significant difference between the two groups after 8 weeks. The most common adverse effects in the NAC+risperidone group were constipation (16.1%), increased appetite (16.1%), fatigue (12.9%), nervousness (12.9%), and daytime drowsiness (12.9%). There was no fatal adverse effect. Risperidone plus NAC more than risperidone plus placebo decreased irritability in children and adolescents with ASD. Meanwhile, it did not change the core symptoms of autism. Adverse effects were not common and NAC was generally tolerated well. This trial was registered at http:\/\/www.irct.ir. The registration number of this trial was IRCT201106103930N6.","333":"According to the proposed interference of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) with pathophysiologic processes of autistic disorders (ADs), we aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of NAC as an adjunct to risperidone in the treatment of ADs in a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial. The participants were referred outpatients between 4 and 12 years of age with the diagnosis of ADs and a score of more than 12 on Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) Irritability subscale score. The participants were randomized into 2 groups. One group received risperidone plus NAC, and the other group received risperidone plus placebo. The dose of risperidone was titrated between 1 and 2.0 mg\/d, and the dose of NAC was 600 to 900 mg\/d. The main outcome was mean decrease in the ABC-C irritability subscale score from baseline at 5 and 10 weeks. Changes in other subscales were considered as secondary outcome measures. Forty patients completed the 10-week trial. Baseline characteristics including age, sex and body weight, as well as baseline scores in 5 subscales did not demonstrate statistically significant difference between the 2 groups. Repeated-measures analysis showed significant effect for time \u00d7 treatment interaction in irritability (P = 0.01) and hyperactivity\/noncompliance (P = 0.02) subscales. By week 10, the NAC group showed significantly more reduction in irritability (P = 0.02) and hyperactivity\/noncompliance (P = 0.01) subscales scores. N-acetylcysteine can be considered as an adjuvant therapy for ADs with beneficial therapeutic outcomes.","334":"Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that forms part of a spectrum of related disorders referred to as Autism Spectrum Disorders. The present study assessed the effects of topiramate plus risperidone in the treatment of autistic disorder. Forty children between the ages of 4 and 12 years with a DSM IV clinical diagnosis of autism who were outpatients from a specialty clinic for children were recruited. The children presented with a chief complaint of severely disruptive symptoms related to autistic disorder. Patients were randomly allocated to topiramate+risperidone (Group A) or placebo+risperidone (Group B) for an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The dose of risperidone was titrated up to 2 mg\/day for children between 10 and 40 kg and 3 mg\/day for children weighting above 40 kg. The dose of topiramate was titrated up to 200 mg\/day depending on weight (100 mg\/day for <30 kg and 200 mg\/day for >30 kg). Patients were assessed at baseline and after 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after starting medication. Measure of outcome was the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) Rating Scale. Difference between the two protocols was significant as the group that received topiramate had a greater reduction in ABC-C subscale scores for irritability, stereotypic behavior and hyperactivity\/noncompliance. The results suggest that the combination of topiramate with risperidone may be superior to risperidone monotherapy for children with autistic disorder. However the results need to be further confirmed by a larger randomized controlled trial.","335":"The aim of the study was to compare safety, efficacy and tolerability of risperidone with haloperidol in the treatment of Autistic Disorder (AD). This study was designed as a double-blind, prospective, for a 12-week period. A total of 30 subjects, between the ages of 8 and 18 with AD based on DSM IV criteria, were included in the study. Behavioral Rating Scales were performed by the investigators and the parents. Safety assessment included vital signs, electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram, adverse events, laboratory tests, extrapyramidal symptoms and the side effects. Both treatments were applied in a once daily dosage regimen of 0.01-0.08 mg\/kg\/day. The reduction from baseline in Ritvo-Freeman Real Life Rating Scale (RF-RLRS), sensory motor (subscale I) and language (subscale V) scores were significant in risperidone group (P < 0.05). Compared to haloperidol, risperidone led to a significantly greater reduction in the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and Turgay DSM-IV Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) scale scores (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). There was a greater increase of prolactin in the risperidone group, while alanine amino transferase (ALT) had further increased in the haloperidol group. Sensory motor behaviors (subscale I) and language at the end of the 12th week, RF-RLRS sensory motor and language subscale scores decreased in the risperidone group further than the other group (P < 0.05). Risperidone was found to be more effective than haloperidol in the treatment of behavioral symptoms, impulsivity, language skills, and impaired social relations in children with AD. These results demonstrated that both drugs were safe and well tolerated in the treatment of AD.","336":"Given significant genetic, molecular, and phenotypic overlaps, researchers have begun to investigate whether targeted treatments for Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) could also be beneficial for patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). For example, low-dose sertraline, an SSRI, was used in two recent controlled trials in children with FXS and ASD. The first trial recruited 52 children with FXS, 32 of which were also diagnosed with ASD; the second trial recruited 58 children with non-syndromic ASD. One focus of the present study is to compare the response to sertraline between the FXS-associated ASD and non-syndromic ASD groups. Another focus is to compare baseline ASD-related characteristics between the groups and review these differences within the context of recent literature comparing these populations. Our comparison showed more severe ASD profiles in children with non-syndromic ASD vs. FXS-associated ASD. Regarding response to sertraline, the FXS-ASD group displayed significant improvements in language development, while the non-syndromic group did not show any significant improvements. One possible explanation for this differential response is the distinct anxiety profiles that are seen in these two groups. The heightened anxiety phenotype seen in those with FXS-ASD may have led to a greater relief of anxiety symptoms with sertraline compared to those with non-syndromic ASD; this, in turn, could have led to measurably greater developmental gains. Further research is required to solidify this connection between anxiety relief and developmental gains in these populations.","337":"<b>Objective:<\/b> Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like sertraline have been shown in observational studies and anecdotal reports to improve language development in young children with fragile X syndrome (FXS).

The increase of >200 Cytosine Guanine Guanine (CGG) repeats in the 5' untranslated region of the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene results in transcriptional silencing on the FMR1 gene with a subsequent reduction or absence of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA binding protein involved in the maturation and elimination of synapses. In addition to intellectual disability, common features of FXS are behavioral problems, autism, language deficits and atypical physical features. There are still no currently approved curative therapies for FXS, and clinical management continues to focus on symptomatic treatment of comorbid behaviors and psychiatric problems. Here we discuss several treatments that target the neurobiological pathway abnormal in FXS. These medications are clinically available at present and the data suggest that these medications can be helpful for those with FXS.","339":null,"340":"Sulforaphane (SF), an isothiocyanate in broccoli, has potential benefits relevant to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through its effects on several metabolic and immunologic pathways. Previous clinical trials of oral SF demonstrated positive clinical effects on behavior in young men and changes in urinary metabolomics in children with ASD. We conducted a 15-week randomized parallel double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial with 15-week open-label treatment and 6-week no-treatment extensions in 57 children, ages 3-12\u00a0years, with ASD over 36\u00a0weeks. Twenty-eight were assigned SF and 29 received placebo (PL). Clinical effects, safety and tolerability of SF were measured as were biomarkers to elucidate mechanisms of action of SF in ASD. Data from 22 children taking SF and 23 on PL were analyzed. Treatment effects on the primary outcome measure, the Ohio Autism Clinical Impressions Scale (OACIS), in the general level of autism were not significant between SF and PL groups at 7 and 15\u00a0weeks. The effect sizes on the OACIS were non-statistically significant but positive, suggesting a possible trend toward greater improvement in those on treatment with SF (Cohen's d 0.21; 95% CI -\u20090.46, 0.88 and 0.10; 95% CI -\u20090.52, 0.72, respectively). Both groups improved in all subscales when on SF during the open-label phase. Caregiver ratings on secondary outcome measures improved significantly on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) at 15\u00a0weeks (Cohen's d -\u20090.96; 95% CI -\u20091.73, -\u20090.15), but not on the Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2). Ratings on the ABC and SRS-2 improved with a non-randomized analysis of the length of exposure to SF, compared to the pre-treatment baseline (p\u2009<\u20090.001). There were significant changes with SF compared to PL in biomarkers of glutathione redox status, mitochondrial respiration, inflammatory markers and heat shock proteins. Clinical laboratory studies confirmed product safety. SF was very well tolerated and side effects of treatment, none serious, included rare insomnia, irritability and intolerance of the taste and smell. The sample size was limited to 45 children with ASD and we did not impute missing data. We were unable to document significant changes in clinical assessments during clinical visits in those taking SF compared to PL. The clinical results were confounded by placebo effects during the open-label phase. SF led to small yet non-statistically significant changes in the total and all subscale scores of the primary outcome measure, while for secondary outcome measures, caregivers' assessments of children taking SF showed statistically significant improvements compared to those taking PL on the ABC but not the SRS-2. Clinical effects of SF were less notable in children compared to our previous trial of a SF-rich preparation in young men with ASD. Several of the effects of SF on biomarkers correlated to clinical improvements. SF was very well tolerated and safe and effective based on our secondary clinical measures. This study was prospectively registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02561481) on September 28, 2015. Funding was provided by the U.S. Department of Defense.","341":"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders with no drugs treating the core symptoms and no validated biomarkers for clinical use. The multi-functional phytochemical sulforaphane affects many of the biochemical abnormalities associated with ASD. We investigated potential molecular markers from three ASD-associated physiological pathways that can be affected by sulforaphane: redox metabolism\/oxidative stress; heat shock response; and immune dysregulation\/inflammation, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors and patients with ASD. We first analyzed the mRNA levels of selected molecular markers in response to sulforaphane ex vivo treatment in PBMCs from healthy donors by real-time quantitative PCR. All of the tested markers showed quantifiability, accuracy and reproducibility. We then compared the expression levels of those markers in PBMCs taken from ASD patients in response to orally-delivered sulforaphane. The mRNA levels of cytoprotective enzymes (NQO1, HO-1, AKR1C1), and heat shock proteins (HSP27 and HSP70), increased. Conversely, mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, COX-2 and TNF-\u03b1) decreased. Individually none is sufficiently specific or sensitive, but when grouped by function as two panels, these biomarkers show promise for monitoring pharmacodynamic responses to sulforaphane in both healthy and autistic humans, and providing guidance for biomedical interventions.","342":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 children, is characterized by impaired social interaction and communication as well as restricted or repetitive behaviors, and varies widely with respect to its causes and presentations. There are no validated pharmacologic treatments for the core symptoms of ASD. The social, medical, and economic burdens of ASD on families and caregivers are profound. We recently showed in a small clinical trial that sulforaphane (SF) from broccoli sprouts could significantly reduce the behavioral symptoms of ASD. After we completed the intervention phase of the original trial (2011-2013), many caregivers used over-the-counter dietary SF supplements in order to attempt to maintain improvements similar to those noted during the intervention. We periodically followed the progress of study participants through the summer of 2016. Families of 16 of the 26 subjects who received SF as part of the original study responded to requests for further information. Of these subjects, 6 did not continue taking SF supplements after the study. Nine of the 16 subjects are still taking an SF supplement and a 10th planned to. We present the edited testimonials of their caregivers in this case series. Many parents and caregivers articulated the positive effects of SF, both during the intervention phase and in the ensuing 3 years reported herein. These observations may contribute to understanding ASD and to treatments that may alleviate some of its symptoms. Diet- and supplement-based therapies deserve careful consideration for their potential to provide vital clinical as well as biochemical information about ASD.","343":"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) comprises a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders that begin in early childhood. They are characterized by differences in behavior and delays in communication and affect at least 1% of children. Observational studies have now confirmed that behaviors of a substantial percentage of children with autism tend to improve with the onset of febrile illness, which might be the downstream effects of altered metabolic pathways involving increased expression of heat shock proteins (HSP) and cellular stress responses. Sulforaphane, a phytochemical derived from a number of cruciferous vegetables, most notably broccoli sprouts, has metabolic effects that in some ways resemble that of fever. This review paper discusses this \"fever effect\" and the intracellular effects of sulforaphane as well as the results of our recent clinical trial of sulforaphane in young adults with autism. The accompanying review by Liu et al. describes the cellular actions of sulforaphane and potential biomarkers in the study of ASD.","344":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), characterized by both impaired communication and social interaction, and by stereotypic behavior, affects about 1 in 68, predominantly males. The medico-economic burdens of ASD are enormous, and no recognized treatment targets the core features of ASD. In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial, young men (aged 13-27) with moderate to severe ASD received the phytochemical sulforaphane (n = 29)--derived from broccoli sprout extracts--or indistinguishable placebo (n = 15). The effects on behavior of daily oral doses of sulforaphane (50-150 \u00b5mol) for 18 wk, followed by 4 wk without treatment, were quantified by three widely accepted behavioral measures completed by parents\/caregivers and physicians: the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), and Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale (CGI-I). Initial scores for ABC and SRS were closely matched for participants assigned to placebo and sulforaphane. After 18 wk, participants receiving placebo experienced minimal change (<3.3%), whereas those receiving sulforaphane showed substantial declines (improvement of behavior): 34% for ABC (P < 0.001, comparing treatments) and 17% for SRS scores (P = 0.017). On CGI-I, a significantly greater number of participants receiving sulforaphane had improvement in social interaction, abnormal behavior, and verbal communication (P = 0.015-0.007). Upon discontinuation of sulforaphane, total scores on all scales rose toward pretreatment levels. Dietary sulforaphane, of recognized low toxicity, was selected for its capacity to reverse abnormalities that have been associated with ASD, including oxidative stress and lower antioxidant capacity, depressed glutathione synthesis, reduced mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation, increased lipid peroxidation, and neuroinflammmation.","345":"The purpose of this study was to determine if tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) reduced core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this study, 46 children, 3-7 years of age diagnosed with an ASD were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with 20\u2009mg\/kg\/day BH4 or placebo for 16 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement and Severity Scales (CGI-I and CGI-S); secondary outcomes were the Preschool Language Scale-4 (PLS-4), Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (Vineland). Overall, no differences were found on global improvement as measured with the CGI-I or CGI-S. Secondary measures indicated significant improvements for BH4 relative to placebo with regard to social awareness, autism mannerisms, hyperactivity, and inappropriate speech. Side effects were minimal and similar between both active medication and placebo. These results indicate that BH4 offers promise in reducing symptoms of ASD.

We comprehensively searched multiple electronic databases to identify relevant literature. Studies were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The quality of studies was appraised using the \"Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards\" (CHEERS) tool. This study is conducted and reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Out of a total of 252 items, after review, 32 articles were fully reviewed, and, finally, 7 studies met inclusion and exclusion criteria. The discount rate was in the range of 1.5-3.5%. Studies included showed semaglutide offered more QALYs than anti-obesity drugs but because of higher cost, in some cases, ICER exceeds the willingness to pay threshold. Results show that semaglutide creates higher total cost compared to conventional interventions in patients with class I, II, and III obesities. Results show that in patients with class I obesity (BMI 33) lifestyle intervention (LI), endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG), Sleeve gastrectomy (SG), and semaglutide create $124,195; $126,732; $139,971; and $370,776, respectively. The current systematic review showed that semaglutide provides more QALYs and creates more costs in comparison with phentermine-topiramate, phentermine, and naltrexone-bupropion. Semaglutide may be cost-effective with substantial cost reduction. Semaglutide appears to be cost-effective versus diet and exercise (D&E) and liraglutide but it was not cost-effective versus sleeve gastrectomy, endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty, and gastric bypass.","347":"The study systematically reviewed the effectiveness of pharmacological treatments alone or combined with brief cognitive-behavioural therapy (BCBT) for treating Iranian amphetamine abusers. The secondary aim was to review the efficacy of BCBT alone or combined with pharmacological treatments for treating amphetamine abusers in the world. Published trials were considered for inclusion. The review was conducted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Web of Science, MEDLINE (via PubMed), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group's Specialised Register of Trials, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, PsychINFO, Iran Medex, Magiran and the Scientific Information Database were searched (January 2001 to March 2019). The reference lists of included studies were hand searched for more information. A systematic literature search in eight databases produced 10 trials. Risperidone reduced positive psychotic symptoms while aripiprazole reduced negative psychotic symptoms. Methylphenidate reduced craving and depression compared with placebo. Topiramate reduced addiction severity and craving for methamphetamine abuse compared with placebo. Buprenorphine reduced methamphetamine craving more than methadone. Haloperidol and risperidone reduced psychosis. Riluzole reduced craving, withdrawal, and depression compared with placebo. Abstinence from amphetamine or reduction in amphetamine abuse was confirmed in four BCBT studies and one study which applied BCBT with a pharmacological treatment which were stable between two and 12-months. Other changes in BCBT studies were as follows: reduced polydrug use; drug injection, criminality and severity of amphetamine dependence at six-month follow-up; improved general functioning; mental health; stage of change as well as improved motivation to change in a pharmacological + BCBT study. A review of trials indicates that pharmacological treatments and BCBT in a research setting outperform control conditions in treating amphetamines abuse and associated harms. Large-scale studies should determine if both treatments can be effective in clinical settings.","348":"To date, no medication has been approved as an effective treatment for methamphetamine dependence. Topiramate has attracted considerable attention as a treatment for the dependence on alcohol and stimulants. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of topiramate for methamphetamine dependence. This study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. In the present investigation, 62 methamphetamine-dependent adults were enrolled and randomized into two groups, and received topiramate or a placebo for 10 weeks in escalating doses from 50 mg\/day to the target maintenance dose of 200 mg\/day. Addiction severity index (ASI) and craving scores were registered every week. The Beck questionnaire was also given to each participant at baseline and every 2 weeks during the treatment. Urine samples were collected at baseline and every 2 weeks during the treatment. Fifty-seven patients completed 10 weeks of the trial. There was no significant difference between both groups in the mean percentage of prescribed capsules taken by the participants. At week six, the topiramate group showed a significantly lower proportion of methamphetamine-positive urine tests in comparison with the placebo group (P = 0.01). In addition, there were significantly lower scores in the topiramate group in comparison with the placebo group in two domains of ASI: drug use severity (P < 0.001) and drug need (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the craving score (duration) significantly declined in the topiramate patients compared to those receiving the placebo. In conclusion, the results of this trial suggest that topiramate may be beneficial for the treatment of methamphetamine dependence.","349":"The present study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of low-dose topiramate and compare it with sodium valproate that is prevalently prescribed as a migraine prophylaxis. This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial on 56 patients who completed the course of study. Topiramate and valproate were administered at 50 mg\/day and 400 mg\/day, respectively, during the follow-up period. Frequency, intensity, duration, associated symptoms with headaches, analgesics use, as well as drugs' side effects were studied. Participants completed MIDAS and HIT-6 questionnaires before and after treatment. Frequency, intensity, and duration of migraine headaches as well as MIDAS score and symptomatic medications decreased significantly between repeated follow-up visits in both groups. Responder rate for patients treated with topiramate and valproate were 71.6% and 64.3%, respectively, and the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. The reduction of headache severity in the topiramate group was significantly more than that in the valproate group (p = .027). During the study, no statistically significant reduction in associated symptoms with migraine were observed in both the groups. Topiramate dose of 50 mg\/day with fewer side effects in comparison with its higher doses may be an appropriate substitution for first-line migraine prophylaxis such as valproate.","350":null,"351":"Trofinetide was approved for the treatment of Rett syndrome (RTT) in patients aged \u22652 years based on the results of the 12-week, randomized, phase 3 LAVENDER study.

Benefiting the ability to communicate in RTT is often identified as the most important caregiver goal for new therapies. This analysis reports the communication-related end points from the phase 3 LAVENDER study of trofinetide in RTT. Females with RTT, aged five to 20\u00a0years, were randomized 1:1 to trofinetide or placebo for 12\u00a0weeks. Secondary efficacy end points related to communication were based on change from baseline to week 12 and included the caregiver-rated Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales Developmental Profile\u2122 Infant-Toddler Checklist (CSBS-DP-IT) Social Composite score (key secondary end point; scores ranged from 0 to 26 [higher scores indicated better communication]) and novel clinician rating scales (0 [normal] to 7 [severe impairment]) measuring the ability to communicate choices nonverbally (RTT-COMC) and verbally (RTT-VCOM).

This study was an exploratory, phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study of the safety and tolerability of orally administered trofinetide in 72 adolescent and adult males with fragile X syndrome. Subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 35 or 70\u00a0mg\/kg twice daily trofinetide or placebo for 28\u00a0days. Safety assessments included adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms, physical examinations, and concomitant medications. Efficacy measurements were categorized into four efficacy domains, which related to clinically relevant phenotypic dimensions of impairment associated with fragile X syndrome. Both 35 and 70\u00a0mg\/kg dose levels of trofinetide were well tolerated and appeared to be generally safe. Trofinetide at the 70\u00a0mg\/kg dose level demonstrated efficacy compared with placebo based on prespecified criteria. On the basis of a permutation test, the probability of a false-positive outcome for the achieved prespecified success was 0.045. In the group analysis, improvement from treatment baseline was demonstrated on three fragile X syndrome-specific outcome measures. Trofinetide was well tolerated in adolescent and adult males with fragile X syndrome. Despite the relatively short duration of the study, a consistent signal of efficacy at the higher dose was observed in both caregiver and clinician assessments, based on a novel analytical model incorporating evaluation of multiple key symptom areas of fragile X syndrome.

This was a phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, in which safety\/tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and clinical response to trofinetide were characterized in 82 children\/adolescents with RTT, aged 5 to 15 years. Sixty-two participants were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive placebo twice a day (bid) for 14 days, followed by placebo, 50, 100, or 200 mg\/kg bid of trofinetide for 42 days. Following blinded safety data review, 20 additional participants were randomized 1:1 to the 200 mg\/kg or placebo bid groups. Safety assessments included adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations, and concomitant medications. Clinician- and caregiver-based efficacy measurements assessed clinically relevant, phenotypic dimensions of impairment of RTT. All dose levels were well tolerated and generally safe. Trofinetide at 200 mg\/kg bid showed statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements relative to placebo on the Rett Syndrome Behaviour Questionnaire, RTT-Clinician Domain Specific Concerns-Visual Analog Scale, and Clinical Global Impression Scale-Improvement. Exploratory analyses suggested that observed changes correlated with trofinetide exposure. These results, together with those from a previous adolescent\/adult trial, indicate trofinetide's potential for treating core RTT symptoms and support further trials.

Subjects' OAS aggression scores showed significant correlation with the already validated retrospectively rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist Community Scale irritability subscale. Further study of the OAS in outpatients with aggression and developmental disabilities is warranted.","362":"An adult female with congenital Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) and severe mental retardation is described, who presented with symptoms of severe over-activity, short attention span, mood lability, and aggressive outbursts in a cyclical pattern, suggestive of recurrent manic-like episodes. These symptoms improved significantly with divalproex (Depakote) monotherapy. Review of the existing studies showed that 10-76% of persons with RTS may be identified with similar behavioral symptoms. We postulate other persons with RTS may respond to divalproex, and there may be some relationship between the chromosome 16p13.3 deletion and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor or neurotransmitter abnormalities. Recent molecular genetic studies suggest a linkage of this region to bipolar mood disorder and autism, both of which were diagnosed in this patient. Further prospective study is needed of RTS persons regarding behavioral problems, comorbid psychiatric diagnoses, and treatment responses, correlated with genetic abnormalities.","363":"The role of vitamin D and omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 LCPUFA) in improving core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children has been investigated by a few randomised controlled trials and the results are mixed and inconclusive. The response to treatment with these nutrients is heterogenous and may be influenced by inflammatory state. As an exploratory analysis, we investigated whether inflammatory state would modulate the effect of these nutrients on core symptoms of ASD. Methods<i>:<\/i> Seventy-three New Zealand children with ASD (2.5-8.0 years) completed a 12-month randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D (VID, 2000 IU\/day), omega-3 LCPUFA; (OM, 722 mg\/day docosahexaenoic acid), or both (VIDOM). Non-fasting baseline plasma interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) was available for 67 children (VID = 15, OM = 21, VIDOM = 15, placebo = 16). Children were categorised as having undetectable\/normal IL-1\u03b2 (<3.2 pg\/ml, <i>n<\/i>=15) or elevated IL-1\u03b2 (\u22653.2 pg\/mL, <i>n<\/i> = 52). The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) questionnaire was used to assess core symptoms of ASD (baseline, 12-month). Mixed model repeated measure analyses (including all children or only children with elevated IL-1\u03b2) were used. We found evidence for an interaction between baseline IL-1\u03b2 and treatment response for SRS-total, SRS-social communicative functioning, SRS-awareness and SRS-communication (all <i>P<\/i><sub>interaction<\/sub> < 0.10). When all children were included in the analysis, two outcome comparisons (treatments vs. placebo) showed greater improvements: VID, no effect (all <i>P<\/i> > 0.10); OM and VIDOM (<i>P<\/i> = 0.01) for SRS-awareness. When only children with elevated IL-1\u03b2 were included, five outcomes showed greater improvements: OM (<i>P<\/i> = 0.01) for SRS-total; OM (<i>P<\/i> = 0.03) for SRS-social communicative functioning; VID (<i>P<\/i> = 0.01), OM (<i>P<\/i> = 0.003) and VIDOM (<i>P<\/i> = 0.01) for SRS-awareness. Inflammatory state may have modulated responses to vitamin D and omega-3 LCPUFA intervention in children with ASD, suggesting children with elevated inflammation may benefit more from daily vitamin D and omega-3 LCPUFA supplementation.","364":"Irritability and hyperactivity are common in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Because pharmacological treatments may have adverse effects, and despite limited evidence, caregivers\/parents often use dietary supplements such as vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids to address these behavioural symptoms. As a secondary objective of the VIDOMA (Vitamin D and Omega-3 in ASD) trial, we evaluated the efficacy of vitamin D, omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid [omega-3 LCPUFA; docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)], or both on irritability and hyperactivity. New Zealand children with ASD (aged 2.5-8 years) participated in a 12-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D (2000 IU\/day, VID), omega-3 LCPUFA (722\u2009mg\/day DHA, OM), or both (2000 IU\/day vitamin D\u2009+\u2009722\u2009mg\/day DHA, VIDOM). The primary outcomes were the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist (ABC) domains of irritability and hyperactivity. Biomarkers (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and omega-3 index) and primary outcomes were measured at baseline and 12-months. Out of 111 children who completed baseline data collection, 66% completed the study (VID\u2009=\u200919, OM\u2009=\u200923, VIDOM\u2009=\u200915, placebo\u2009=\u200916). After 12 months, children receiving OM (-5.0\u2009\u00b1\u20095.0, P\u2009=\u20090.001) and VID (-4.0\u00b14.9, P\u2009=\u20090.01) had greater reduction in irritability than placebo (0.8\u00b16.1). Compared to placebo, children on VID also had greater reduction in hyperactivity (-5.2\u00b16.3 vs. -0.8\u00b15.6, P\u2009=\u20090.047). Serum 25(OH)D concentration (nmol\/L, mean\u00b1SD) increased by 27\u00b114 in VID and by 36\u00b117 in VIDOM groups (P\u2009<\u20090.0001), and omega-3 index (%, median (25th, 75th percentiles)) by 4.4 (3.3, 5.9) in OM and by 4.0 (2.0, 6.0) in VIDOM groups (P\u2009<\u20090.0001), indicating a good compliance rate. The results indicate that vitamin D and omega-3 LCPUFA reduced irritability symptoms in children with ASD. Vitamin D also reduced hyperactivity symptoms in these children.","365":"We evaluated the efficacy of vitamin D (VID), omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 LCPUFA, OM), or both (VIDOM) on core symptoms of ASD. New Zealand children with ASD (n\u2009=\u200973; aged 2.5-8.0\u00a0years) received daily 2000\u00a0IU vitamin D<sub>3<\/sub>, 722\u00a0mg docosahexaenoic acid, both, or placebo. Outcome measures were Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and Sensory Processing Measure (SPM). Of 42 outcome measures comparisons (interventions vs. placebo), two showed greater improvements (P\u2009=\u20090.03, OM and VIDOM for SRS-social awareness) and four showed trends for greater improvements (P\u2009<\u20090.1, VIDOM for SRS-social communicative functioning, OM for SRS-total, VIDOM for SPM-taste\/smell and OM for SPM-balance\/motion). Omega-3 LCPUFA with and without vitamin D may improve some core symptoms of ASD but no definitive conclusions can be made.","366":"There is strong mechanistic evidence to suggest that vitamin D and omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFAs), specifically docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have the potential to significantly improve the symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, there are no trials that have measured the effect of both vitamin D and n-3 LCPUFA supplementation on autism severity symptoms. The objective of this 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 factorial trial is to investigate the effect of vitamin D, n-3 LCPUFAs or a combination of both on core symptoms of ASD. Children with ASD living in New Zealand (n\u2009=\u2009168 children) will be randomised to one of four treatments daily: vitamin D (2000\u00a0IU), n-3 LCPUFAs (722\u00a0mg DHA), vitamin D (2000\u00a0IU)\u2009+\u2009n-3 LCPUFAs (722\u00a0mg DHA) or placebo for 12\u00a0months. All researchers, participants and their caregivers will be blinded until the data analysis is completed, and randomisation of the active\/placebo capsules and allocation will be fully concealed from all mentioned parties. The primary outcome measures are the change in social-communicative functioning, sensory processing issues and problem behaviours between baseline and 12\u00a0months. A secondary outcome measure is the effect on gastrointestinal symptoms. Baseline data will be used to assess and correct basic nutritional deficiencies prior to treatment allocation. For safety measures, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D 25(OH)D and calcium will be monitored at baseline, 6 and 12\u00a0months, and weekly compliance and gastrointestinal symptom diaries will be completed by caregivers throughout the study period. To our knowledge there are no randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of both vitamin D and DHA supplementation on core symptoms of ASD. If it is shown that either vitamin D, DHA or both are effective, the trial would reveal a non-invasive approach to managing ASD symptoms.

This study aimed to investigate and compare the effect of age on dose-adjusted serum concentrations of 6 commonly used antipsychotic medications in both sexes. Patients with serum concentration measurements of amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and zuclopenthixol were retrospectively included from a therapeutic drug monitoring service. The primary outcome measure for each antipsychotic was the dose-adjusted serum concentration (C:D ratio), assessed across groups divided by sex and age (18-49 years, 50-74 years, and \u226575 years). The data were analyzed using linear mixed modeling with restricted maximum likelihood estimation. A total of 19,926 patients (53% male) with 74,194 serum concentration measurements were included. For most antipsychotics, the C:D ratios increased significantly with age, with generally larger differences observed in females compared with males. The largest impact of age was observed for risperidone, where C:D ratios in the age groups 50-74 years and \u226575 years were 20% and 81% higher for males, respectively, compared with the reference group (18-49 years). For females, the C:D ratios were 28% and 92% higher, respectively, compared with females aged 18-49 years (all P < 0.001). The smallest impact of age was observed for aripiprazole, with no significant differences in C:D ratios across age groups for males. For females treated with aripiprazole, C:D ratios were 8% and 28% higher in the 50-74 and \u226575 years age groups, respectively, compared with females aged 18-49 years (both P < 0.001). The age-dependent increase in dose-adjusted serum concentrations among males and females varied across different antipsychotics and was highest for risperidone. These findings emphasize the importance of proper monitoring of antipsychotic use in older adults.","368":"Antipsychotic drugs are the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia. Even though several novel second-generation antipsychotics (i.e. lurasidone, iloperidone and cariprazine) have been approved in recent years, typical antipsychotics (e.g. chlorpromazine, haloperidol, and fluphenazine) remain a crucial therapeutic option for the condition around the world. Little is known about the relative risk-to-benefit ratio of the 'latest' second-generation antipsychotics compared to the typical agents of 'established stature'. To systematically review the efficacy and safety of lurasidone versus typical antipsychotics for adults with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-related disorders. We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials on 5 June 2019. We also ran an update search in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and three additional databases as well as two trial registers and the US Food and Drug Administration database on 1 April 2024. We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing lurasidonewith typical antipsychotic drugs (such as chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, haloperidol, loxapine, mesoridazine, molindone, perphenazine, thioridazine, thiothixene, zuclopenthixol) for adults with schizophrenia. No additional search restrictions were applied. We followed standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We extracted information on participant characteristics, interventions, study outcomes, study design, trial methods, and funding sources. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE for these key outcomes: change in mental state, death by suicide or natural cause, quality of life, total serious adverse events and severe adverse events (as defined by study authors). We included two studies with a total of 308 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia (220 men and 85 women). A total of 223 participants received lurasidone (20, 40, or 80 mg\/day), and 82 received haloperidol (up to 10 mg\/day) or perphenazine (up to 32 mg\/day); three people did not receive any study medication. Both studies were performed in the US. The duration of the follow-up was four to six weeks. Death by suicide\/natural causes and quality of life were not reported by the two included studies. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of lurasidone on change in mental state: the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (MD 3.74, 95% CI 0.57 to 6.90; 1 RCT, 281 participants; very low-certainty evidence); and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (MD 6.68, 95% CI 2.45 to 10.91; 1 RCT, 281 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is also very uncertain about the effects of lurasidone on total serious adverse events (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.60; 2 RCTs, 303 participants; very low certainty of evidence) and on severe adverse events (RR 1.70, 95% CI 0.46 to 6.32; 1 RCT, 281 participants; very low certainty of evidence). We are very uncertain about whether lurasidone offers benefits to the mental state, total serious adverse events, or severe adverse events when compared to typical antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia. The evidence included in this review is of very low certainty, derived from two small trials. Study limitations (risk of bias) and imprecise results impacted our confidence in the evidence. Furthermore, data on mortality (due to suicide or natural causes) or quality of life are unavailable. Further large-scale randomized studies are needed to provide clearer insights into the benefits and harms of lurasidone compared to typical antipsychotics for treating schizophrenia.","369":"Bipolar disorder (BD) often necessitates hospitalization, especially during manic episodes. Long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) are theorized to enhance treatment adherence and decrease rehospitalization rates compared to oral medications. This study aimed to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of LAIs in reducing rehospitalizations among BD patients admitted for bipolar mania. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from a tertiary psychiatry hospital in Taiwan spanning January 1st, 2006, to December 31st, 2017. We analyzed 2212 hospitalizations among 945 patients with bipolar mania. A mixed-effects Cox regression model compared rehospitalization hazards between LAIs, mood stabilizer plus oral antipsychotic (MS\u00a0+\u00a0OAP), and mood stabilizer only (MS) groups. Sensitivity analyses assessed robustness across various subgroup criteria. LAI treatment significantly reduced the hazard of rehospitalization within one year post-discharge compared to MS\u00a0+\u00a0OAP (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.29, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.56-3.36) and MS alone (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.66, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.68-4.21). This effect was consistent across different rehospitalization types-all-cause, bipolar disorder-specific, and bipolar mania-specific. Each additional previous hospitalization was associated with higher hazard of rehospitalization across the three rehospitalization types. Sensitivity analyses suggested LAIs' efficacy in manic episodes with and without psychotic symptoms and for patients with frequent hospitalizations. The LAIs included in the analysis are haloperidol, risperidone, fluphenazine, flupentixol, and zuclopenthixol. Our findings suggest that the addition of LAIs for bipolar mania during acute inpatient treatment is associated with reduced rehospitalizations, particularly among patients with recurrent hospitalizations, making it a valuable option. However, the lack of outpatient prescription data limits our ability to further substantiate this concept, warranting future research.","370":"It's well known that sex is a risk factor for the occurrence of adverse events (AEs), most of which have found sex differences. Real-world data studies on the sex differences of fall-risk-increasing drugs (FRIDs) are few and far between, with most small-scale retrospective studies based on FRID classes. To establish a list of FRIDs and describe their sex differences, we used preferred terms from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities to search for AEs in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), and then perform disproportionality analyses and female\/male ratio analyses. During January 2004 to March 2023, 101,746 fall-related AEs were reported in FAERS from patients aged 50 to 100, with 68,492 (67.3%) females and 32,547 (32.0%) males. We found 261 signals for females while 284 for males. For females, the top 3 signals with the highest reporting odds ratio (ROR) were anethole trithione, clopenthixol, nikethamide (ROR: 388.88, 212.10, 113.94), while the top 3 signals with the highest lower limit of information component (IC<sub>025<\/sub>) were nikethamide, anethole trithione, benzbromarone (IC<sub>025<\/sub>: 3.91, 3.15, 2.49). For males, the top 3 signals with the highest ROR were fluprednidene acetate, potassium hydroxide, ketazolam (ROR: 216.86, 108.43, 108.43), while the top 3 signals with the highest IC<sub>025<\/sub> were clomethiazole, piribedil, melperone (IC<sub>025<\/sub>: 3.31, 3.24, 2.99). Moreover, among the 119 shared signals found between males and females, 33 were positively correlated with falls in females and 38 with falls in males. Signals showing significant sex differences were mainly concentrated on agents of the immune, nervous, musculo-skeletal, and cardiovascular systems. We offered a series of FRIDs and suggested their sex differences in falls through the FAERS. In the future, it is essential to balance the inclusion of women and men, and analyse sex-stratified for FRIDs.","371":"Reducing the dose of psychosis drugs in a gradual hyperbolic manner may minimise withdrawal effects and risk of relapse. There is presently limited guidance on tapering decanoate-based long-acting injectable dopamine antagonists (LIDAs). We aimed to apply hyperbolic principles of tapering to the decanoate-based LIDAs flupentixol, zuclopenthixol and haloperidol to develop withdrawal regimens. We used in silico methodology to predict plasma drug levels and D<sub>2<\/sub> occupancy for different LIDA regimens. Existing pharmacokinetic and receptor occupancy data from nuclear neuroimaging studies were used to power modelling. Abrupt discontinuation was examined as a potential strategy, and dose reduction was modelled with pre-defined constraints used in similar work of 10 (fast regimens), 5 (moderate) and 2.5 (slow) percentage points of D<sub>2<\/sub> occupancy change per month. Abrupt discontinuation of decanoate-based LIDAs leads to excessive change in D<sub>2<\/sub> occupancy which violated our pre-defined constraints, potentially resulting in withdrawal symptoms and increased risk of relapse. Reduction of LIDA dose allowed hyperbolic reduction in plasma level consistent with imposed constraints on receptor occupancy reduction rate. For equivalent per-weekly LIDA dosing, more frequent administration allowed a more gradual reduction of D<sub>2<\/sub> occupancy. However, switching to oral forms is required to continue hyperbolic tapering to full discontinuation; reduction to zero using only LIDA produces too large a reduction in D<sub>2<\/sub> occupancy. Guidance for reduction and cessation of LIDAs according to slow, moderate and fast criteria is provided. Abrupt cessation of decanoate LIDAs is not consistent with gradual hyperbolic tapering, despite their longer half-lives compared with oral formulations. Reduction to the point of full discontinuation can only be achieved by switching to oral therapy to complete the taper. These results are limited by the in silico and theoretical nature of the study, and there is a need to confirm these findings through real-world observational and interventional studies.","372":"<b>Aim:<\/b> We herein inferred the genetic diversity of CYP450 isoenzymes to predict the percentage of patients who need dose adjustment in drugs used in psychiatry.<b>Materials & methods:<\/b> Data of 784 Greek patients receiving psychiatric care who were genotyped for CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP1A2, CYP3A5 and CYP2C9 isoenzymes were inferred to gene-drug pairs according to the US FDA, Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium and Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group annotations and published literature.<b>Results:<\/b> Atypical metabolism was found for 36.8% of patients in CYP2D6, 49.2% in CYP2C19, 45% in CYP1A2, 16.7% in CYP3A5 and 41.8% in CYP2C9. Dosage adjustment need was estimated for 10.2% of venlafaxine, 10.0% of paroxetine, 6.4% of sertraline, 30.8% of citalopram, 52.1% of escitalopram, 18.2% of fluvoxamine, 54.1% of tricyclic antidepressants, 16.7% of zuclopenthixol, 10.6% of haloperidol\u00a0and 13.3% of risperidone treated patients.<b>Conclusion:<\/b> Clinical psychiatric pharmacogenomic implementation holds promise to improve drug effectiveness and safety.","373":"The incidence of melanoma brain metastasis (MBM) is high and significantly compromises patient survival and quality of life. Effective treatment of MBM is made difficult by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), since it restricts the entry of drugs into the brain. Certain anti-psychotic drugs able to cross the BBB have demonstrated efficacy in suppressing brain metastasis in preclinical studies. However, the activity of zuclopenthixol against MBM is not yet clear. Cell viability assays were employed to investigate the potential of zuclopenthixol in the treatment of MBM. Subsequently, the mechanism of action was investigated by RNA-sequencing (RNAseq), flow cytometry-based cell cycle and apoptosis assays, protein expression analysis, and autophagy flux detection. Additionally, the efficacy of zuclopenthixol against tumor growth was investigated <i>in vivo<\/i>, including MBM models. Zuclopenthixol inhibited the proliferation of various melanoma cell lines at minimal doses by causing cell cycle arrest in the G0\/G1 phase and mitochondrial-mediated intrinsic apoptosis. Zuclopenthixol also induced cytoprotective autophagy, and inhibition of autophagy enhanced the anti-melanoma effects of zuclopenthixol. Furthermore, zuclopenthixol inhibited the growth of human melanoma tumors in nude mice, as well as the growth of intracranial metastases in a mouse model of MBM. These results demonstrate that zuclopenthixol has significant potential as an effective therapeutic agent for MBM.","374":"Lifetime co-occurring substance use disorders are common at the time of presentation for the treatment of primary psychosis. Our aim was to investigate the clinical characteristics of adolescents with early-onset schizophrenia\/schizoaffective disorder (EOS), categorized as either with (EOS\u2009+\u2009SUD) or without SUD (non-SUD\/EOS), in a multi-center sample. Between 2016 and 2022, 255 patients were evaluated across three tertiary-care inpatient units. Diagnoses were confirmed by the treating physician according to the DSM-5 during the hospital stay. The severity of symptoms was measured using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The EOS\u2009+\u2009SUD group exhibited a higher illness onset, fewer years of education, longer duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), a higher frequency of male gender, more frequent hospitalizations, increased use of clozapine and zuclopenthixol LAI, along with higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder and conduct disorder. Notably, differences in DUP, clozapine use, and the number of hospitalizations did not persist in the multivariate logistic regression model. Our findings support the notion of SUD playing a role in modifying the course of illness in EOS. Future studies should emphasize exploring treatment responses to medications and interventions among youth with dual diagnoses.","375":"Clozapine, a second-generation antipsychotic (SGA), is considered the gold standard medication to treat patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). Despite its efficacy, clozapine is associated with adverse effects, notably neutropenia and agranulocytosis. Other hematological adverse effects are less common. Severe anemia is a rare adverse effect seldom reported in the literature and is typically associated with pure red cell aplasia (PRCA). Nevertheless, the benefits of clozapine in managing TRS make rechallenge a reasonable option. We present the case of a 35-year-old man with TRS, resistant to previous antipsychotics, who experienced severe anemia during clozapine treatment. An investigation for clozapine-induced anemia revealed PRCA on myelogram. After discontinuing clozapine, the patient's hemoglobin levels recovered. Subsequent treatments with olanzapine, zuclopenthixol, and aripiprazole proved ineffective, leading us to consider a clozapine rechallenge. The rechallenge, monitored for 58 days, resulted in improved psychiatric symptoms and stable hemoglobin levels. The patient remained stable during 6 months of follow-up, with no hematological changes. PRCA is a very rare adverse effect of clozapine. The cause of drug-induced PRCA is still unknown; for clozapine, there are no studies. Rechallenge after a severe and rare adverse effect is a complex decision. This case is the first to report a successful clozapine rechallenge following severe anemia without other blood dyscrasias, emphasizing the imperative need for close monitoring during the rechallenge process. Further study is warranted to understand the predictive factors for a successful outcome in clozapine rechallenges.","376":"Prescribing drugs for psychosis (antipsychotics) is challenging due to high rates of poor treatment outcomes, which are in part explained by an individual's genetics. Pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing can help clinicians tailor the choice or dose of psychosis drugs to an individual's genetics, particularly psychosis drugs with known variable response due to CYP2D6 gene variants ('CYP2D6-PGx antipsychotics'). This study aims to investigate differences between demographic groups prescribed 'CYP2D6-PGx antipsychotics' and estimate the proportion of patients eligible for PGx testing based on current pharmacogenomics guidance. A cross-sectional study took place extracting data from 243 patients' medical records to explore psychosis drug prescribing, including drug transitions. Demographic data such as age, sex, ethnicity, and clinical sub-team were collected and summarised. Descriptive statistics explored the proportion of 'CYP2D6-PGx antipsychotic' prescribing and the nature of transitions. We used logistic regression analysis to investigate associations between demographic variables and prescription of 'CYP2D6-PGx antipsychotic' versus 'non-CYP2D6-PGx antipsychotic'. Two-thirds (164) of patients had been prescribed a 'CYP2D6-PGx antipsychotic' (aripiprazole, risperidone, haloperidol or zuclopenthixol). Over a fifth (23%) of patients would have met the suggested criteria for PGx testing, following two psychosis drug trials. There were no statistically significant differences between age, sex, or ethnicity in the likelihood of being prescribed a 'CYP2D6-PGx antipsychotic'. This study demonstrated high rates of prescribing 'CYP2D6-PGx-antipsychotics' in an EIP cohort, providing a rationale for further exploration of how PGx testing can be implemented in EIP services to personalise the prescribing of drugs for psychosis.","377":"Obesity is characterized by excessive fat accumulation, which is related with abnormal pluripotency of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Recently, there is growing evidence that the disorder of maternal vitamin D (VD) intake is a well-known risk factor for long-term adverse health outcomes to their offspring. Otherwise,\u00a0less is known of its repercussion and underlying mechanisms on the different differentiation potential\u00a0of MSCs. Four-week-old female C57BL\/6J mice were fed with different VD reproductive diets throughout the whole pregnancy and lactation. The characteristics of BMSCs from their seven-day male offspring, VDR knockdown establishment\u00a0of HuMSCs and HuMSCs under the different VD interventions in vitro\u00a0were confirmed by flow cytometry, RT-PCR, and immunofluorescence. The roles of VD on their mitochondrial dysfunction and differentiation potential were also investigated. Then their remaining weaned male pups were induced by administrating high-fat-diet (HFD) for 16\u00a0weeks and normal fat diet was simultaneously as controls. Their lipid accumulation and adipocytes hypertrophy were determined by histological staining and related gene expressions. Herein, it was proved that imbalance of early-life VD\u00a0intake could significantly aggravate the occurrence of obesity by inducing the adipogenesis through affecting the VD metabolism and related metabolites (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Moreover, abnormally maternal VD intake might be involved on the disorders of differentiation potential to inhibit the maintenance of MSCs stemness through increasing the productions of ROS, which was accompanied by impairing the expression of related genes on the adipo-osteogenic differentiation\u00a0(P\u2009<\u20090.05). Moreover, it was along with increasing potential of adipogenic differentiation of MSCs as higher ROS in the state of VD deficiency, while excessive maternal VD status could conversely enhance the osteogenic differentiation with slightly lower ROS (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms might be involved on the mitochondria dysfunctional, especially the mitophagy, by activating the LC3b, P62 and etc. using in vivo and in vitro studies (P\u2009<\u20090.05). These findings demonstrated that imbalance of early-life VD intake could target ROS-mediated crosstalk between mitochondrial dysfunction and differentiation potential of MSCs, which was significantly associated with the\u00a0later obesity. Obviously, our results could\u00a0open up an attractive modality for the benefits of suitable VD intake during the pregnancy and lactation.","378":"Iris color is a prominent phenotypic feature of quail. To understand the mechanism of melanin deposition related to quail iris color, iris tissues were selected from Beijing white and Chinese yellow quail for transcriptome analysis. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with pigmentation were identified using RNA sequencing and validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The identified single nucleotide polymorphisms were studied using bioinformatics and iris color correlation analyses. A total of 485 DEGs were obtained, with 223 upregulated and 262 downregulated. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses were performed. Thirty-two genes were annotated using the GO database. Three important pigment synthesis pathways (Notch signaling, melanogenesis, and tyrosine metabolism) were identified in quail iris tissue (<i>P < 0.05<\/i>). The expression levels of solute carrier family 45 member 2 (<i>SLC45A2<\/i>), tyrosinase-related protein 1, vitamin D receptor, opsin 5, and docking protein 5 were significantly different between Beijing white and Chinese yellow quail, as verified by RT-qPCR. The c.1061C>T mutation in <i>SLC45A2<\/i>, which caused a single amino acid change at position 354 (threonine to methionine), was significantly associated with iris color in Beijing white and Chinese yellow quail, and might be the main reason for the different iris colors between these two quail species.","379":"Primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (pSS) is a systemic autoimmune disease that is prevalent in middle-aged and elderly women, characterized by dry mouth, dry eyes, fatigue, and joint pain. Nearly one-third pSS patients have been suffering with osteoporosis (OP), displaying symptoms of lumbago, back pain, and even fracture, all of which severely affect their life quality. Common risk factors for pSS and OP include gender and age, persistent state of inflammation, immune disorders, intestinal flora imbalance, vitamin D deficiency, dyslipidemia and sarcopenia. Meanwhile, the comorbidities of pSS, such as renal tubular acidosis, primary biliary cholangitis, autoimmune thyroid diseases, and drugs (glucocorticoids, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide) are unique risk factors for pSS complicated with OP. Education, guidance of healthy lifestyle, and OP screening are recommended for bone management of pSS patients. Early detection and intervention are crucial for keeping bone health and life quality in pSS patients.","380":"Prostate cancer is the most common malignant tumor of male genitourinary system, its morbidity and mortality increase year by year, and has become a public health problem affecting male health. Mendelian randomization \uff08MR\uff09 analysis has been widely used in epidemiological etiology inference in recent years. Compared with general observational studies, it avoids the interference of confounding factors and has clear causal sequence. The judgment of disease risk factors is more helpful for early intervention and clinical prevention and treatment of diseases. This paper reviewed the application status of MR analysis in the etiology of prostate cancer, and summarized the causal relationship between the microscopic exposure of vitamin D, telomere length, inorganic salts, testosterone level, lipids and proteins, amino acids, intestinal flora, as well as the macroscopic exposure of underlying diseases, drug use, dietary factors, life and behavior habits, and adolescent development and prostate cancer. It provides the basis for formulating prevention and treatment strategy of prostate cancer from the perspective of risk factors. At the same time, MR analysis in the field of prostate cancer also has shortcomings such as bias in population stratification, difference in data sample size affecting outcome, confounding factors when incorporating aggregated data, and failure to clarify the mechanism of exposure affecting outcome. Future studies should focus on solving these problems.","381":"To investigate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and blood biochemical indicators in early adolescence, and to provide ideas for early prevention of diseases and explore possible disease-related predictors. 3125 participants aged 10\u2009\u223c\u200914 years were selected from China from the survey of \"China Nutrition and Health Surveillance ( 2016\u2009\u223c\u20092017 ) \". Employing advanced statistical methods, including generalized linear models, heatmaps, hierarchical clustering, and generalized additive models, the study delved into the associations between BMI and various biochemical indicators. In early adolescence, indicators including systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, weight, height, BMI, hemoglobin, blood uric acid, serum creatinine, albumin, vitamin A presented increasing trends with the increase of age ( P\u2009<\u20090.05 ), whereas LDL-C, vitamin D, and ferritin showed decreasing trends with the increase of age ( P\u2009<\u20090.05 ). The increase in hemoglobin and blood uric acid levels with age was more pronounced in males compared to females ( P\u2009<\u20090.05 ). BMI was positively correlated with blood glucose, hemoglobin, triglyceride, LDL-C, blood uric acid, serum creatinine, ferritin, transferrin receptor, hs-CRP, total protein, vitamin A ( P\u2009<\u20090.05 ). There was a significant BMI \u00d7 age interaction in the correlation analysis with LDL-C, transferrin receptor, serum creatinine, and hs-CRP ( P\u2009<\u20090.05 ). BMI was a risk factor for hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, low high density lipoprotein cholesterolemia, and metabolic syndrome in all age groups ( OR\u2009>\u20091, P\u2009<\u20090.05 ). High BMI was a risk factor for hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, low high density lipoprotein cholesterolemia, and MetS in early adolescents. With the focus on energy intake beginning in early adolescence, the maintenance of a healthy weight warrants greater attention.","382":"Idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia (IIH) is a rare disorder of PTH-independent hypercalcemia. CYP24A1 and SLC34A1 gene mutations cause two forms of hereditary IIH. In this study, the clinical manifestations and molecular aspects of six new Chinese patients were investigated. The clinical manifestations and laboratory study of six patients with idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia were analyzed retrospectively. Five of the patients were diagnosed with hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and bilateral medullary nephrocalcinosis. Their clinical symptoms and biochemical abnormalities improved after treatment. One patient presented at age 11 years old with arterial hypertension, hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis, but normal serum calcium. Gene analysis showed that two patients had compound heterozygous mutations of CYP24A1, one patient had a monoallelic CYP24A1 variant, and three patients had a monoallelic SLC34A1 variant. Four novel CYP24A1 variants (c.116G\u2009>\u2009C, c.287T\u2009>\u2009A, c.476G\u2009>\u2009A and c.1349T\u2009>\u2009C) and three novel SLC34A1 variants (c.1322\u00a0A\u2009>\u2009G, c.1697_1698insT and c.1726T\u2009>\u2009C) were found in these patients. A monoallelic variant of CYP24A1 or SLC34A1 gene contributes to symptomatic hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis. Manifestations of IIH vary with onset age. Hypercalcemia may not necessarily present after infancy and IIH should be considered in patients with nephrolithiasis either in older children or adults.","383":"This study aimed to investigate the determinants of cancer incidence and mortality in patients with vitamin D deficiency using a real-world population database. We utilized the International Diagnostic Classification Code (ICD9:268 \/ ICD10: E55) to define patients with vitamin D deficiency. Additionally, the Cox regression model was used to estimate overall mortality and identify potential factors contributing to mortality in cancer patients. In 5242 patients with vitamin D deficiency, the development of new-onset cancer was 229 (4.37%) patients. Colon cancer was the most prevalent cancer type. After considering confounding factors, patients aged 50-65 and more than 65 indicated a 3.10-fold (95% C.I.: 2.12-4.51) and 4.55-fold (95% C.I.: 3.03-6.82) cancer incidence, respectively compared with those aged <50. Moreover, patients with comorbidities of diabetes mellitus (DM) (HR: 1.56; 95% C.I.: 1.01-2.41) and liver disease (HR: 1.62; 95% C.I.: 1.03-2.54) presented a higher cancer incidence rate than those without DM\/ liver disease. In addition, vitamin D deficiency patients with cancer and dementia histories indicated a significantly higher mortality risk (HR: 4.04; 95% C.I.: 1.05- 15.56) than those without dementia. In conclusion, our study revealed that vitamin D deficiency patients with liver disease had an increased incidence of cancer, while those with dementia had an increased mortality rate among cancer patients.","384":"This study aimed to investigate the association between vitamin D deficiency (VDD) and post-acute outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. This retrospective study used the TriNetX research network to identify COVID-19 patients between January 1 and November 30, 2022. Patients were matched using propensity score matching (PSM) and divided into VDD (<\u200920\u00a0ng\/mL) and control (\u2265\u200920\u00a0ng\/mL) groups. The primary outcome was a composite of post-COVID-19 condition (identified by ICD-10 code), all-cause emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalization, and death during the follow-up period (90-180\u00a0days) after the diagnosis of COVID-19. From an initial recruitment of 42,674 non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and known 25(OH)D status, a VDD group of 8300 was identified and propensity matched with 8300 controls. During the follow-up period, the VDD group had a higher risk of the primary outcome than did the control group [hazard ratio (HR)\u2009=\u20091.122; 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u20091.041-1.210]. The VDD group also had a higher risk of all-cause ED visits (HR\u2009=\u20091.114; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.012-1.226), all-cause hospitalization (HR\u2009=\u20091.230; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.105-1.369), and all-cause death (HR\u2009=\u20091.748; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.047-2.290) but not post-COVID-19 condition (HR\u2009=\u20090.980; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.630-1.523), individually. Among the COVID-19 patients, VDD might be associated with a higher risk of all-cause ED visits, hospitalization, and death during the post-acute phase.","385":"Intestinal microbiota dysbiosis and metabolic disruption are well-known as the primary triggers of ulcerative colitis (UC). However, their role in regulating the group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s), which are essential for intestinal health, remains unexplored during the development of disease severity. Here, our results showed that the microbiota structure of patients with severe UC (SUCs) differed from those with mild UC (MiUCs), moderate UC (MoUCs), and healthy controls (HCs). Microbes producing secondary bile acids (SBAs) and SBAs decreased with the aggravation of UC, and a strong positive correlation existed between them. Next, fecal microbiota transfer was used to reproduce the human-derived microbiota in mice and decipher the microbiota-mediated inflammatory modulation during an increase in disease severity. Mice receiving SUC-derived microbiota exhibited enhancive inflammation, a lowered percentage of ILC3s, and the down-regulated expressions of bile acid receptors, including vitamin D receptor (VDR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR), in the colon. Similar to clinical results, SBA-producing microbes, deoxycholic acids (DCA), and 12-ketolithocholic acids (12-KLCA) were diminished in the intestine of these recipients. Finally, we compared the therapeutic potential of DCA and 12-KLCA in preventing colitis and the regulatory mechanisms mediated by ILC3s. 12-KLCA but not DCA represented a strong anti-inflammatory effect associated with the higher expression of VDR and the lower secretion of IL-17A from colonic ILC3s. Collectively, these findings provide new signatures for monitoring the acute deterioration of UC by targeting gut microbiota and bile acid metabolism and demonstrate the therapeutic and preventive potential of a novel microbiota-derived metabolite, 12-KLCA.","386":"Post-stroke depression (PSD) affects up to one-third of patients who survive stroke. This matched cohort study aimed to investigate the relationship between vitamin D deficiency (VDD) and PSD using a global health research network. Adult patients with first-ever stroke were eligible for inclusion if their circulating vitamin D levels were available within 3 months before the onset of stroke. Patients were subdivided into those with VDD [VDD group, 25(OH) D\u2009<\u200920\u2009ng\/mL] and those with normal vitamin D levels [control group, 25(OH) D: 30-80\u2009ng\/mL]. By using propensity score matching (PSM), potential confounding factors were adjusted. The primary outcomes were the association of VDD with the risk of PSD at the 3-month and 12-month follow-ups, while the secondary outcomes were the relationships between VDD and the risk of pneumonia as well as emergency department visits at the 12-month follow-up. After PSM, 758 individuals were included in each group, with no significant differences in baseline characteristics. Musculoskeletal diseases, metabolic disorders, and hypertension were the three leading comorbidities in both the groups. The incidence of PSD was not significantly different between the two groups at the 3-month (5.8% vs. 4.7%, <i>p<\/i> =\u20090.358) and 12-month (11.6% vs. 10.2%, <i>p<\/i> =\u20090.364) follow-up. VDD was not associated with an increased risk of PSD at the 3-month [hazard ratio (HR)\u2009=\u20091.258, <i>p<\/i> =\u20090.358] or 12-month follow-up (HR\u2009=\u20091.210, <i>p<\/i> =\u20090.364). In addition, VDD was not associated with an increased risk of pneumonia (HR\u2009=\u20091.053, <i>p<\/i> =\u20090.823) or emergency visits at the 12-month follow-up (HR\u2009=\u20091.206, <i>p<\/i> =\u20090.148). The results revealed no significant link between VDD and PSD risk during the 3-month and 12-month follow-up periods, suggesting that VDD might not play a substantial role in PSD risk. However, further extensive studies employing a prospective design are necessary to explore the potential protective effects of vitamin D against PSD and validate these findings.","387":"Low cerebrospinal (CSF) arginine vasopressin (AVP) concentration is a biomarker of social impairment in low-social monkeys and children with autism, suggesting that AVP administration may improve primate social functioning. However, AVP administration also increases aggression, at least in \"neurotypical\" animals with intact AVP signaling. Here, we tested the effects of a voluntary drug administration method in low-social male rhesus monkeys with high autistic-like trait burden. Monkeys received nebulized AVP or placebo, using a within-subjects design. Study 1 (N = 8) investigated the effects of AVP administration on social cognition in two tests comparing responses to social <i>versus<\/i> nonsocial stimuli. Test 1: Placebo-administered monkeys lacked face recognition memory, whereas face recognition memory was \"rescued\" following AVP administration. In contrast, object recognition memory was intact and did not differ between administration conditions. Test 2: Placebo-administered monkeys did not respond to conspecific social communication cues, whereas following AVP administration, they reciprocated affiliative communication cues with species-typical affiliative responses. Importantly, AVP administration did not increase aggressive responses to conspecific aggressive or affiliative overtures. Study 2 (N = 4) evaluated the pharmacokinetics of this administration method. Following AVP nebulization, we observed a linear increase in cisternal CSF AVP levels, and a quadratic rise and fall in blood AVP levels. These findings indicate that nebulized AVP likely penetrates the central nervous system, selectively promotes species-typical responses to social information, and does not induce aggression in low-social individuals. Nebulized AVP therefore may hold promise for managing similar social symptoms in people with autism, particularly in very young or lower functioning individuals.","388":null,"389":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent and poorly understood neurodevelopmental disorder. There are currently no laboratory-based diagnostic tests to detect ASD, nor are there any disease-modifying medications that effectively treat ASD's core behavioral symptoms. Scientific progress has been impeded, in part, by overreliance on model organisms that fundamentally lack the sophisticated social and cognitive abilities essential for modeling ASD. We therefore saw significant value in studying naturally low-social rhesus monkeys to model human social impairment, taking advantage of a large outdoor-housed colony for behavioral screening and biomarker identification. Careful development and validation of our animal model, combined with a strong commitment to evaluating the translational utility of our preclinical findings directly in patients with ASD, yielded a robust neurochemical marker (cerebrospinal fluid vasopressin concentration) of trans-primate social impairment and a first-in-class medication (intranasal vasopressin) shown in a small phase 2a pilot trial to improve social abilities in children with ASD. This translational research approach stands to advance our understanding of ASD in a manner not readily achievable with existing animal models, and can be adapted to investigate a variety of other human brain disorders which currently lack valid preclinical options, thereby streamlining translation and amplifying clinical impact more broadly.","390":"The social impairments of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have a major impact on quality of life, yet there are no medications that effectively treat these core social behavior deficits. Preclinical research suggests that arginine vasopressin (AVP), a neuropeptide involved in promoting mammalian social behaviors, may be a possible treatment for ASD. Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel study design, we tested the efficacy and tolerability of a 4-week intranasal AVP daily treatment in 30 children with ASD. AVP-treated participants aged 6 to 9.5 years received the maximum daily target dose of 24 International Units (IU); participants aged 9.6 to 12.9 years received the maximum daily target dose of 32 IU. Intranasal AVP treatment compared to placebo enhanced social abilities as assessed by change from baseline in this phase 2 trial's primary outcome measure, the Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd Edition total score (SRS-2 <i>T<\/i> score; <i>F<\/i> <sub>1,20<\/sub> = 9.853; <i>P<\/i> = 0.0052; \u03b7<sub>p<\/sub> <sup>2<\/sup> = 33.0%; Cohen's <i>d<\/i> = 1.40). AVP treatment also diminished anxiety symptoms and some repetitive behaviors. Most of these findings were more pronounced when we accounted for pretreatment AVP concentrations in blood. AVP was well tolerated with minimal side effects. No AVP-treated participants dropped out of the trial, and there were no differences in the rate of adverse events reported between treatment conditions. Last, no changes from baseline were observed in vital signs, electrocardiogram tracings, height and body weight, or clinical chemistry measurements after 4 weeks of AVP treatment. These preliminary findings suggest that AVP has potential for treating social impairments in children with ASD.","391":"Propentofylline is a xanthine phosphodiesterase inhibitor and adenosine reuptake blocker with neuroprotective effects linked to anti-inflammatory and antiexcitatory properties. This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating the potential beneficial effects of propentofylline, as an adjunctive treatment with risperidone, on the severity and behavioral abnormalities of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A total of 48 children with ASD were randomly allocated into 2 groups of risperidone (initiating at 0.5 mg\/d) plus propentofylline (initiating at 300 mg\/d) and risperidone plus placebo. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) and Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) were used for the evaluation of ASD severity and behavioral disruptions at baseline, week 4, and week 10. Primary outcome measure of the study was ABC-C irritability subscale score, whereas CARS score along with other 4 subscales of ABC-C (lethargy\/social withdrawal, stereotypic behavior, hyperactivity\/noncompliance, and inappropriate speech subscales) were considered as secondary outcome measures. Results from the general linear model repeated measures analysis demonstrated significant time-treatment interaction on irritability subscale (F1.55 = 3.45; P = 0.048) and CARS (F1.41 = 4.08; P = 0.034) scores. Compared with the placebo group, children receiving propentofylline showed greater improvements in the CARS score (P = 0.037) from baseline to the study endpoint. Our results found no significant time-treatment effect on other subscales of ABC-C. Two trial groups were comparable based on the frequency of adverse effects. Our findings demonstrated that adjunctive treatment with propentofylline is effective in alleviating disease severity and improving irritability in ASD patients. However, larger studies with longer durations are required to confirm these results.","392":"This study aimed to evaluate efficacy and safety of prednisolone as an adjunctive treatment to risperidone, in children with regressive autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The current 12-week, randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled trial recruited 37 patients with regressive ASD. The participants were allocated to receive either 1 mg\/kg per day prednisolone or matched placebo in addition to risperidone. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Edition (ABC-C) scale and Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) were used to measure behavioral outcomes at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12 of the study course. The primary outcome was the change in ABC-irritability subscale score, whereas the secondary outcomes were the change in scores of other ABC-C subscales, in CARS score, and in the level of inflammatory biomarkers. Twenty-six patients completed the 12 weeks of study period. Repeated-measures analysis demonstrated significant effect for time-treatment interaction in the CARS (F (1, 2.23) = 13.22, P < 0.001), as well as 4 subscales of the ABC-C including: irritability (F (1, 2.12) = 3.84, P = 0.026), hyperactivity (F (1, 2.09) = 3.56, P = 0.039), lethargy (F (1, 2.18) = 31.50, P < 0.001), and stereotypy (F (1, 1.89) = 4.04, P = 0.026). However, no significant time-treatment interaction was identified for inappropriate speech subscale (F (1, 2.03) = 1.71, P = 0.191). In addition, inflammatory biomarkers were significantly decreased after 3 months of prednisolone add-on. No significant adverse event was detected during the trial. Prednisolone, as an add-on to risperidone, could remarkably improve core features in children with regressive ASD.","393":"Pregnenolone is a neurosteroid with modulatory effects on \u03b3-aminobutyric acid neurotransmission. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of pregnenolone add-on to risperidone in adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Sixty-four ASD patients were randomly allocated to receive either pregnenolone (n = 32) or matching placebo (n = 32) in addition to risperidone. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Edition scale was used to evaluate the behavioral status of patients at baseline, week 5, and the trial end point. The change in score of irritability subscale was the primary outcome. Frequency of adverse effects due to trial medications was compared between the treatment groups. Fifty-nine patients completed the trial (30 in pregnenolone and 29 in the placebo arm). Baseline characteristics of both treatment groups were similar (P > 0.05). Repeated measures analysis was suggestive of greater exhibited improvement for the pregnenolone group on irritability, stereotypy, and hyperactivity subscales of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Edition over the trial period (F = 3.84, df = 1.96, P = 0.025; F = 4.29, df = 1.39, P = 0.029; F = 6.55, df = 1.67, P = 0.004, respectively). Nonetheless, the alterations in lethargy and inappropriate speech domains scores were similar for both arms (F = 0.93, df = 1.49, P = 0.375; F = 1.10, df = 1.60, P = 0.325, respectively). There was no significant difference in frequency as well as severity of adverse effects between the 2 groups. Pregnenolone adjunct to risperidone could attenuate core features associated with ASD."},"Authors":{"0":"Amatachaya Anuwat, Jensen Mark P, Patjanasoontorn Niramol, Auvichayapat Narong, Suphakunpinyo
