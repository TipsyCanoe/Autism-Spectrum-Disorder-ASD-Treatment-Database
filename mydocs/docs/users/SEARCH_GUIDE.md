## Results

To the left are the studies that pertain to your search. By default, all studies are loaded. You can click on a treatment title and bring up the relevant studies. Clicking on the study will bring up a brief summary, including the **primary outcome area**, **primary outcome measure**, **the treatment duration**, **publication date**, **authors**, **PMID** in Pubmed, and the **link** to the study in Pubmed.

## Most Recent Results

If you feel like the studies are out-of-date, please click the **Update Database** button on the Home Page. This will update our database and help detect the most up-to-date papers. The process will take a couple of minutes, so we appreciate your patience.
