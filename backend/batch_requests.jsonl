The current study tested the hypothesis that pain reduction with tDCS is associated with an increase in the peak frequency spectrum density in the theta-alpha range. Twenty patients with spinal cord injury and bilateral neuropathic pain received single sessions of both sham and anodal tDCS (2 mA) over the left primary motor area (M1) for 20 min. Treatment order was randomly assigned. Pre- to post-procedure changes in pain intensity and peak frequency of electroencephalogram spectral analysis were compared between treatment conditions. The active treatment condition (anodal tDCS over M1) but not sham treatment resulted in significant decreases in pain intensity. In addition, consistent with the study hypothesis, peak theta-alpha frequency (PTAF) assessed from an electrode placed over the site of stimulation increased more from pre- to post-session among participants in the active tDCS condition, relative to those in the sham tDCS condition. Moreover, we found a significant association between a decrease in pain intensity and an increase in PTAF at the stimulation site. The findings are consistent with the possibility that anodal tDCS over the left M1 may be effective, at least in part, because it results in an increase in M1 cortical excitability, perhaps due to a pain inhibitory effect of motor cortex stimulation that may influence the descending pain modulation system. Future research is needed to determine if there is a causal association between increased left anterior activity and pain reduction.

Both aripiprazole doses demonstrated significantly (p\u2003<\u20030.001) greater improvements in YMRS total score at endpoint compared with placebo in protocol-specified last observation carried forward analyses, but not in observed case or mixed-model repeated measures at week 30. Overall time to all-cause discontinuation was longer for aripiprazole 10\u2003mg/day (15.6\u2003weeks) and aripiprazole 30\u2003mg/day (9.5\u2003weeks) compared with placebo (5.3\u2003weeks; both p\u2003<\u20030.05 versus placebo). Both aripiprazole doses were significantly superior to placebo regarding response rates, Children's Global Assessment of Functioning and Clinical Global Impressions-Bipolar severity of overall and mania scores at endpoint in all analyses. Commonly reported adverse events included headache, somnolence, and extrapyramidal disorder. \u2002 Aripiprazole 10\u2003mg/day and 30\u2003mg/day were superior to placebo and generally well tolerated in pediatric subjects with bipolar I disorder up to 30\u2003weeks.

This was a post-hoc analysis of data from a 4-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate which informants detect response to treatment with aripiprazole in pediatric subjects experiencing a mixed or manic episode associated with bipolar I disorder. Efficacy assessments included clinician-rated scales and the parent- and subject-rated 10-item General Behavior Inventory Mania (GBI-M10) and Depression (GBI-D10) scales. Cohen's d quantified effect sizes for total scale scores and individual line items. Parent-GBI-M10 total, clinician-rated Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total, and Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar Disorder (CGI-BP) Mania scores produced similar effect sizes, suggesting that the parent-GBI-M10 is sensitive to treatment-related improvements in manic symptoms. Aripiprazole improved a broad spectrum of parent-rated mania symptoms; six parent-GBI-M10 line item effect sizes were moderate (>0.5) in at least one of the two aripiprazole treatment arms (10 or 30 mg/day). Subject-completed GBI-M10 line item effect sizes were consistently smaller, indicating that the subjects' experience of treatment effects were less pronounced.

Clinically significant improvements in depressive symptoms as assessed by decreases in the MADRS Total score were greater with adjunctive aripiprazole (-10.1) than placebo (-6.4; P<.001). Remission rates were greater for adjunctive aripiprazole than for adjunctive placebo (week 14, 36.8% vs 18.9%; P<.001). Completion rates with adjunctive aripiprazole and placebo were high (83% vs. 87%) and discontinuations due to adverse events were low (6.2% vs 1.7%). For some patients with MDD who do not obtain adequate symptom relief with antidepressant monotherapy, adjunctive therapies can significantly improve depressive symptoms. As reported, adjunctive aripiprazole was associated with a two-fold higher remission rate than adjunctive placebo. This, and previous studies, have shown that discontinuations due to adverse events were low and completion rates were high, and has indicated that both antidepressant and aripiprazole in combination were relatively well-tolerated and safe. This is the third consecutive clinical trial, in the absence of a failed trial, to demonstrate that aripiprazole augmentation to antidepressants is an efficacious and well-tolerated treatment for patients with MDD who do not respond adequately to standard antidepressant monotherapy (ClinicalTrials.gov study NCT00105196)., keywords: Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Antidepressive Agents, Antipsychotic Agents, Aripiprazole, Depressive Disorder, Major, Double-Blind Method, Drug Resistance, Endpoint Determination, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Piperazines, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Quinolones, Treatment Failure, Young Adult"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

The present paper is the first report, to our knowledge, on the neurocognitive effects of aripiprazole. Unlike other second-generation antipsychotics, aripiprazole is a D(2) and D(3) receptor partial agonist. It is unknown what effects this unusual pharmacological profile may yield on neurocognition. The present open-label study included data on 169 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were randomly treated with aripiprazole or olanzapine. Subjects received a neurocognitive battery at baseline, week 8, and 26. The aripiprazole group had a significantly greater dropout rate than the olanzapine group. Neurocognitive data were reduced through a principal components analysis that yielded a three-factor solution. The factors were general cognitive functioning, executive functioning, and verbal learning. For general cognitive functioning, both groups improved from baseline and the effects were relatively stable over the 26-week protocol. There were no differential treatment effects. For executive functioning, neither group improved significantly from baseline. For verbal learning, the aripiprazole group improved significantly from baseline to the 8th and 26th week of assessment, and there was a between-group effect favoring aripiprazole over olanzapine that was largely attributable to the differences in performance within the 8th week.

In this study, 97 patients aged 6 to 17 years with ADHD and ASD were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with 1.2 mg/kg/day atomoxetine or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) score; secondary endpoints were the Clinical Global Impression of ADHD-Improvement (CGI-I) and the Conners Teacher Rating Scale-Revised: Short Form (CTRS-R:S) score. Baseline mean ADHD-RS scores for atomoxetine versus placebo were 40.7 and 38.6; after 8 weeks, mixed-effect model repeated-measure means were 31.6 (95% confidence interval 29.2-33.9) and 38.3 (36.0-40.6), respectively, with a difference in least square means of -6.7 (-10.0 to -3.4; p < .001). The CTRS-R:S Hyperactivity subscore also improved significantly for atomoxetine compared with placebo, but not the other CTRS-R:S subscores. However, there were not significantly more patients on atomoxetine (20.9%) who improved much, or very much according to the CGI-I, than on placebo (8.7%; p = 0.14). Adverse events (mostly nausea, decrease in appetite, fatigue, and early morning awakening) were reported in 81.3% of atomoxetine patients and 65.3% of placebo patients (p > .1). There were no serious adverse events. Atomoxetine moderately improved ADHD symptoms in patients with ASD and was generally well tolerated.

In a 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 design, 128 children with ASD and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were randomly assigned ATX, PT+placebo, PT+ATX, or placebo alone. PT was weekly for 10 weeks, and then monthly. ATX/placebo was titrated over 6 weeks [\u22641.8\u2009mg/kg/d], and then maintained until week 10. Responders continued to week 34 or nonresponse. Placebo nonresponders had a 10-week ATX open trial; ATX nonresponders were treated clinically. All continued to week 34. With no further treatment from the study, all were invited to follow-up (FU) at 1.5 years postbaseline; 94 (73%) participated. Changes from Week 34 to FU and from baseline to FU were tested by one-way analysis of variance or chi-squared test.

Bumetanide reduced significantly the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) (D90-D0; P<0.004 treated vs placebo), Clinical Global Impressions (P<0.017 treated vs placebo) and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule values when the most severe cases (CARS values above the mean \u00b1 s.d.; n=9) were removed (Wilcoxon test: P-value=0.031; Student's t-test: P-value=0.017). Side effects were restricted to an occasional mild hypokalaemia (3.0-3.5 mM\u2009l(-1) K(+)) that was treated with supplemental potassium. In a companion study, chronic bumetanide treatment significantly improved accuracy in facial emotional labelling, and increased brain activation in areas involved in social and emotional perception (Hadjikhani et al., submitted). Therefore, bumetanide is a promising novel therapeutic agent to treat autism.

A total of 120 children were enrolled into the study and randomly assigned to either 0.5\u00a0mg bumetanide or placebo. In the final sample, 119 children received at least one dose of bumetanide (59 children) or placebo (60 children) were included in the final analysis. The primary outcome was a reduction in the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) score, and the secondary outcomes were the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI) -Global Improvement (CGI-I) score at 3\u00a0months and the change from baseline to 3-month in the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to measure \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate neurotransmitter concentrations in the insular cortex (IC) before and after the treatment. As compared with the placebo, bumetanide treatment was significantly better in reducing the severity. No patient withdrew from the trial due to adverse events. The superiority of bumetanide to placebo in reducing insular GABA, measured using MRS, was demonstrated. The clinical improvement was associated with a decrease in insular GABA in the bumetanide group. In conclusion, this trial in a large group of young children with predominantly moderate and severe ASD demonstrated that bumetanide is safe and effective in improving the core symptoms of ASD.

TSC is strongly associated with broad neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder symptomatology. Preclinical TSC studies have indicated altered neuronal chloride homeostasis affecting the polarity of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) ergic transmission as a potential treatment target. Bumetanide, a selective NKCC1 chloride importer antagonist, may attenuate depolarizing GABA action, and in that way reduce disease burden. In this open-label pilot study, we tested the effect of bumetanide on a variety of neurophysiological, cognitive, and behavioral measures in children with TSC. Participants were treated with bumetanide (2dd 0.5-1.0\u2009mg) for 13\u2009weeks in an open-label trial. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability (ABC-I) subscale was chosen as the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included other behavioral questionnaires in addition to event-related potentials (ERP) and neuropsychological tests if tolerated. Additionally, the treatment effect on seizure frequency and quality of life was assessed. Endpoint data were collected at baseline, after 91\u2009days of treatment and after a 28-day wash-out period. Fifteen patients (8-21-years old) with TSC were included of which 13 patients completed the study. Treatment was well-tolerated with only expected adverse events due to the diuretic effects of bumetanide. Irritable behavior (ABC-I) showed significant improvement after treatment in 11 out of 13 patients (t(12) = 4.41, p = .001, d = .773).

Moreover, patients rated their own health-related quality of life higher after treatment. At baseline, TSC patients showed several atypical ERPs versus typically developing peers of which prepulse inhibition was significantly decreased in the TSC group. Neuropsychological measurements showed no change and bumetanide had no effect on seizure frequency. The sample size and open-label design of this pilot study warrant caution when interpreting outcome measures.

Randomized clinical trial of citalopram hydrobromide for children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders and prominent repetitive behavior. Baseline data at study entry were examined with respect to final outcome to determine if response predictors could be identified.

Baseline measures included demographic (sex, age, weight, and pubertal status), clinical, and family measures. Clinical variables included baseline illness severity ratings (the Aberrant Behavior Checklist, the Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised, and the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale). Family measures included the Caregiver Strain Questionnaire. Several baseline predictors of response were identified, and a principal component analysis yielded 3 composite measures (disruptive behavior, autism/mood, and caregiver strain) that significantly predicted response at week 12. Specifically, participants in the placebo group were significantly less likely than participants in the citalopram group to respond at week 12 if they entered the study more symptomatic on each of the 3 composite measures, and they were at least 2 times less likely to be responders.

To date, clinical trials examining the use of SSRIs in autism have been limited by small sample sizes and inconclusive results. The efficacy and safety of SSRIs for moderating autistic behaviors is yet to be adequately examined to provide evidence to support current clinical practice. The aim of the Fluoxetine for Autistic Behaviors (FAB) study is to determine the efficacy and safety of low dose fluoxetine compared with placebo, for reducing the frequency and severity of repetitive stereotypic behaviors in children and adolescents with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The relationship between the effectiveness of fluoxetine treatment and serotonin transporter genotype will also be explored. The FAB study is a multicenter, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial, funded by the Australian Government's National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) grant. Participants will be aged between 7.5 and 17 years with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD. Eligible participants will be randomized to either placebo or fluoxetine for a 16-week period. Medication will be titrated over the first four weeks. Reponses to medication will be monitored fortnightly using the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI). The primary outcome measure is the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale-Modified for Pervasive Developmental Disorders (CYBOCS-PDD), administered at baseline and 16 weeks. Secondary outcome measures include the Aberrant Behaviour Scale (ABC), the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale Parent Report (SCAS-P), and the Repetitive Behaviors Scale (RBS-R), measured at baseline and 16 weeks. Participants will be invited to undergo genetic testing for SLC6A4 allele variants using a cheek swab. Continuous outcomes, including the primary outcome will be compared between the active and placebo groups using unadjusted linear regression.

Medications are often needed to reduce agitation, but it is unclear what the desired level of sedation is. This study assessed personalized sedation goals (PSGs) and their predictors for patients in a delirium clinical trial and in clinical vignettes. This was a preplanned secondary analysis of a double-blind randomized clinical trial examining the sedative effect of chlorpromazine and/or haloperidol in patients with agitated delirium. At the baseline, caregivers and nurses were independently asked to select the PSG for the trial patient from 5 choices corresponding to Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) scores of 0 or higher (no sedation), -1 to -2, -3, -4, and -5 (deep sedation). Respondents also selected a PSG for 6 vignettes that differed by the level of agitation, ability to communicate, and survival. Forty-two caregivers and 39 nurses answered questions regarding PSGs. For the trial patient, caregivers preferred RASS scores of -1 to -2 most often (36%), whereas nurses preferred an RASS score of -3 most often (51 %). Caregivers were significantly more likely than nurses to choose lighter sedation (odds ratio [OR], 4.8; P = .01) despite reporting greater delirium-related distress (P = .0006). Patients were undersedated 33% to 53% of the time and oversedated 0% to 15% of the time according to the PSG response criteria. In the case vignettes, deeper sedation was preferred by nurses (P < .0001) and for patients who were unable to communicate (OR, 3.1-4.4; P < .0001) and had a shorter life expectancy (OR, 1.7; P = .002). Caregivers often preferred lighter sedation than nurses. Many patients were undersedated in comparison with caregivers' PSGs, and this highlights room for improvement. In the last days of life, many patients with cancer develop delirium and become restless/agitated; this can be highly distressing. Caregivers and physicians alike are often concerned about the use of sedatives for agitated delirium and try to find a balance between maximizing comfort and maintaining communication.

Emerging evidence suggests that the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) may be a blood-based biomarker of social functioning and a possible treatment for ASD. However, prior OXT treatment trials have produced equivocal results, perhaps because of variability in patients' underlying neuropeptide biology, but this hypothesis has not been tested. Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design, we tested the efficacy and tolerability of 4-wk intranasal OXT treatment (24 International Units, twice daily) in 32 children with ASD, aged 6-12 y. When pretreatment neuropeptide measures were included in the statistical model, OXT compared with placebo treatment significantly enhanced social abilities in children with ASD [as measured by the trial's primary outcome measure, the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS)]. Importantly, pretreatment blood OXT concentrations also predicted treatment response, such that individuals with the lowest pretreatment OXT concentrations showed the greatest social improvement. OXT was well tolerated, and its effects were specific to social functioning, with no observed decrease in repetitive behaviors or anxiety. Finally, as with many trials, some placebo-treated participants showed improvement on the SRS. This enhanced social functioning was mirrored by a posttreatment increase in their blood OXT concentrations, suggesting that increased endogenous OXT secretion may underlie this improvement. These findings indicate that OXT treatment enhances social abilities in children with ASD and that individuals with pretreatment OXT signaling deficits may stand to benefit the most from OXT treatment., keywords: Administration, Inhalation, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Female, Humans, Male, Oxytocics, Oxytocin, Social Skills"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

Treatment with some commonly used antipsychotic medications may increase the risk of developing metabolic syndrome. The aim of the study was to evaluate the safety of lurasidone in patients who continued lurasidone or switched from risperidone to lurasidone. A secondary aim was assessment of the effect of long-term lurasidone on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The treatment sample in the current study consisted of clinically stable patients with schizophrenia (N\u2009=\u2009223) who had completed a 12-month, double-blind study of lurasidone vs. risperidone.

The primary efficacy measure was change from baseline to week 6 in the Children's Depression Rating Scale, Revised (CDRS-R). Treatment response was defined as 50% or greater improvement on the CDRS-R from baseline to week 6. Cognitive function was evaluated with the computerized Brief Cogstate Battery at baseline and week 6. Analyses were adjusted for baseline BMI, as well as age. HsCRP was evaluated as a logarithmically transformed continuous variable and as a categorical variable dichotomized into lower (<1 mg/L) and higher (\u22651 mg/L) subgroups. A significant interaction was found between baseline hsCRP and treatment group for change in CDRS-R score at study endpoint, with larger placebo-corrected effect sizes for lurasidone in the higher baseline hsCRP group (\u22651 mg/L).

Similarly, a significant interaction effect was observed for the combination of hsCRP and BMI on the procognitive effect of lurasidone, with higher baseline hsCRP levels being associated with improvement in cognitive function for lurasidone (vs placebo) in the normal BMI range subgroup but not in overweight/obese patients. These results suggest that young patients with bipolar depression with normal weight and higher levels of pre-treatment CRP may show a greater placebo-adjusted improvement in depressive symptoms and cognitive performance when treated with lurasidone.

It is also associated with ritualistic and stereotypical behaviour. Recent studies propose both hyper-and hypoglutamatergic ideologies for autism. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of memantine plus risperidone in the treatment of children with autism. Children with autism were randomly allocated to risperidone plus memantine or placebo plus risperidone for a 10-wk, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The dose of risperidone was titrated up to 3\u00a0mg/d and memantine was titrated to 20\u00a0mg/d. Children were assessed at baseline and after 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 wk of starting medication protocol. The primary outcome measure was the irritability subscale of Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C). Difference between the two treatment arms was significant as the group that received memantine had greater reduction in ABC-C subscale scores for irritability, stereotypic behaviour and hyperactivity. Eight side-effects were observed over the trial, out of the 25 side-effects that the checklist included. The difference between the two groups in the frequency of side-effects was not significant.

MPH doses of 0.3 and 0.6 mg/kg per dose and a placebo were given.

Significant improvement on teacher ratings of hyperactivity and inattention as well as clinic-based observations of activity level and compliance were associated with MPH. Eight of 11 preschool children were medication responders (based on a minimum 40% decrease between placebo and one drug condition on either the teacher-rated Conners Hyperactivity Index or the Hyperactive-Distractible subscale of the Preschool Behavior Questionnaire). Five children exhibited significant adverse drug side effects such as severe social withdrawal, increased crying, and irritability, especially at the higher dose (0.6 mg/kg).

Recently developed nonpsychostimulant treatments have allowed certain patients to switch from a psychostimulant to a nonpsychostimulant. However, the outcomes of such switches have not been systematically studied. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess treatment tolerance and efficacy during a cross-taper transition from methylphenidate or amphetamine to atomoxetine among children and adolescents with ADHD. This pilot study was conducted in patients (aged 6-17 years) with incomplete responses (failure to obtain full reduction/elimination of symptoms) or intolerance of adverse events (AEs) during psychostimulant treatment. Patients continued ongoing psychostimulant treatment during the first week of the study. Transition to atomoxetine began by administering atomoxetine 0.5 mg/kg . d plus full-dose psychostimulant for 1 week, followed in the second week by 1.2 mg/kg . d atomoxetine plus half-dose psychostimulant. Patients remained on 1.2 mg/kg . d atomoxetine monotherapy for the remaining 5 weeks. This stepwise transition was enacted due to the difference in pharmacodynamics between the psychostimulants and atomoxetine. Applying a stepwise cross-titration allowed for better control of ADHD symptoms during the intervening period. Change in ADHD symptoms, as measured by the mean change in the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-IV-Parent Version: Investigator-administered and -scored (ADHDRS-IV-Parent:Inv), was assessed from baseline to end point. Of the 62 subjects enrolled in the study, 39 (62.9%) were diagnosed as ADHD-combined type. Similar proportions were receiving methylphenidate (51.6%) and amphetamine (48.4%). Slightly more wished to switch due to inadequate response (53.2%) than intolerability (46.8%). Nine subjects discontinued at various times during the course of the study (patient or parent/caregiver decision [4], AE [2], protocol violation [2], and lack of efficacy [1]). Mean (SD) ADHDRS-IV-Parent:Inv total scores (n = 59, last-observation-carried-forward) improved significantly from baseline (visit 2) to an end point (32.1 [10.5] vs 22.6 [14.0]; P < 0.001).

These studies mostly demonstrated the acute effects of single-dose administrations, examining task-dependent effects of oxytocin on brain activity elicited during explicit experimental tasks or stimuli presentations. The increased consideration of oxytocin as a potential ameliorating treatment in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) requires a better understanding of how multiple-dose oxytocin administration affects intrinsic, task-free, amygdala function. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with between-subject design, 38 adult men with ASD underwent resting-state fMRI scanning before and after oxytocin or placebo treatment. Effects were assessed either after a single-dose administration, consisting of 24 international units, or after multiple-dose treatment, consisting of 4 weeks of once-daily nasal spray administrations. Compared to placebo, oxytocin induced a decrease in intrinsic resting-state BOLD signal amplitudes of the bilateral amygdala (fractional amplitudes of low-frequency fluctuations) and modulated cross-frequency interactions between adjacent BOLD frequency components. The right amygdala showed a pattern of reduced cross-frequency harmonicity, while the left amygdala showed a relative increase in harmonic cross-frequency interactions after oxytocin treatment. Notably, the direction and magnitude of BOLD spectral changes induced after a single-dose were qualitatively similar to treatment effects induced after multiple-dose treatment. Furthermore, the identified spectral changes in amygdalar BOLD amplitude and cross-frequency harmonicity were associated with improved feelings of tension, reflecting oxytocin's anxiolytic, stress-reducing neuromodulatory role. The observed effects of oxytocin on amygdalar BOLD spectral characteristics and associated behaviors contribute to a deeper mechanistic understanding of the intrinsic, task-free neuromodulatory dynamics that underlie single- and multiple-dose oxytocin treatment in ASD.

In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, we investigated the effects of single-dose and multiple-dose IN-OT treatment (4 weeks of daily (24 IU) administrations) on brain activity related to processing emotional states. Thirty-eight adult men with ASD (aged between 18 and 35 years) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging of the posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTS) and amygdala regions while processing emotional states from point-light biological motion. In line with prior research, a single dose of IN-OT induced a reliable increase in pSTS brain activity during the processing of point-light biological motion, but no consistent long-term changes in pSTS activity were induced after the multiple-dose treatment. In terms of bilateral amygdala, the multiple-dose treatment induced a consistent attenuation in brain activity, which outlasted the period of actual administrations until four weeks and one year post-treatment. Critically, participants with stronger attenuations in amygdala-activity showed greater behavioral improvements, particularly in terms of self-reported feelings of avoidant attachment and social functioning. Together, these observations provide initial insights into the long-lasting neural consequences of chronic IN-OT use on amygdala functioning and provide first indications that the acute versus chronic effects of IN-OT administration may be qualitatively different.

Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design, this pilot clinical trial explored the possibility of long-lasting behavioral effects of 4 weeks of intranasal oxytocin treatment (24 International Units once daily in the morning) in 40 adult men with ASD. To do so, self-report and informant-based questionnaires assessing core autism symptoms and characterizations of attachment were administered at baseline, immediately after 4 weeks of treatment (approximately 24 h after the last nasal spray administration), and at two follow-up sessions, 4 weeks and 1 year post-treatment. No treatment-specific effects were identified in the primary outcome assessing social symptoms (Social Responsiveness Scale, self- and informant-rated). In particular, with respect to self-reported social responsiveness, improvements were evident both in the oxytocin and in the placebo group, yielding no significant between-group difference (<i>p</i> = .37). Also informant-rated improvements in social responsiveness were not significantly larger in the oxytocin, compared to the placebo group (between-group difference: <i>p</i> = .19). Among the secondary outcome measures, treatment-specific improvements were identified in the Repetitive Behavior Scale and State Adult Attachment Measure, indicating reductions in self-reported repetitive behaviors (<i>p</i> = .04) and reduced feelings of avoidance toward others (<i>p</i> = .03) in the oxytocin group compared to the placebo group, up to 1 month and even 1 year post-treatment.

Participants (NAC: n\u00a0=\u00a031, placebo: n\u00a0=\u00a029) were assessed at baseline and week 16 using the Montgomery \u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and were dichotomised into \"responders\" (MADRS at week 16\u00a0<\u00a050% of MADRS at baseline) and \"non-responders\" (MADRS at week 16\u00a0>\u00a050% at baseline). Untargeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was performed to analyse baseline levels of 68 serum metabolites. Of the nine metabolites that differentiated placebo and NAC groups, five were amino acids with lower levels in the NAC responder group compared with the NAC non-responders. Further analysis generated a predictive model of MADRS improvement including glycine, norleucine, threonine, proline, phenylalanine, tyrosine, glutamic acid, lysine and leucine (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.853; adjusted R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.733). This prediction model predicted 85% of the variance in MADRS outcome after adjunctive treatment with NAC. BD participants with lower serum levels of free amino acids at baseline may be more likely to respond to adjunctive treatment with NAC., keywords: Acetylcysteine, Bipolar Disorder, Depression, Double-Blind Method, Drug Therapy, Combination, Humans, Treatment Outcome"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

However, anything from 40-60\u00a0% of people on clozapine experience residual symptoms even on adequate doses of the medication, and thus could be considered 'clozapine resistant'. Agents that could work alongside clozapine to improve efficacy whilst not increasing the adverse effect burden are both desired and necessary to improve the lives of individuals with clozapine-resistant SZ. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is one such possible agent. Previous research from our research group provided promising pilot data suggesting the efficacy of NAC in this patient population. The aim of the study reported here is to expand this work by conducting a large scale clinical trial of NAC in the treatment of clozapine-resistant SZ. This study is an investigator initiated, multi-site, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. It aims to include 168 patients with clozapine-resistant SZ, divided into an intervention group (NAC) and a control group (placebo). Participants in the intervention group will receive 2\u00a0g daily of NAC. The primary outcome measures will be the negative symptom scores of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Secondary outcome measures will include: changes in quality of life (QoL) as measured by the Lancashire Quality of Life Profile (LQoLP) and cognitive functioning as measured by the total score on the MATRICS. Additionally we will examine peripheral and cortical glutathione (GSH) concentrations as process outcomes. This large scale clinical trial will investigate the efficacy of NAC as an adjunctive medication to clozapine.

Cognition may be affected across a range of domains, including memory, psychomotor skills, and executive function. Whilst the exact mechanisms of cognitive change after surgery are not precisely known, oxidative stress and subsequent neuroinflammation have been implicated. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) acts via multiple interrelated mechanisms to influence oxidative homeostasis, neuronal transmission, and inflammation. NAC has been shown to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in both human and animal models. There is clinical evidence to suggest that NAC may be beneficial in preventing the cognitive decline associated with both acute physiological insults and dementia-related disorders. To date, no trials have examined perioperative NAC as a potential moderator of postoperative cognitive changes in the noncardiac surgery setting. This is a single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, with a between-group, repeated-measures, longitudinal design. The study will recruit 370 noncardiac surgical patients at the University Hospital Geelong, aged 60\u00a0years or older. Participants are randomly assigned to receive either NAC or placebo (1:1 ratio), and groups are stratified by age and surgery type. Participants undergo a series of neuropsychological tests prior to surgery, 7\u00a0days, 3\u00a0months, and 12\u00a0months post surgery. It is hypothesised that the perioperative administration of NAC will reduce the degree of postoperative cognitive changes at early and long-term follow-up, as measured by changes on individual measures of the neurocognitive battery, when compared with placebo. Serum samples are taken on the day of surgery and on day 2 post surgery to quantitate any changes in levels of biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress. The PANACEA trial aims to examine the potential efficacy of perioperative NAC to reduce the severity of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in an elderly, noncardiac surgery population. This is an entirely novel approach to the prevention of postoperative cognitive dysfunction and will have high impact and translatable outcomes if NAC is found to be beneficial.

Clinical trials of the efficacy of OT in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have reported mixed results due in part to ASD's complex etiology. We investigated whether genetic and epigenetic variation contribute to variable endogenous OT levels that modulate sensitivity to OT therapy. To carry out this analysis, we integrated genome-wide profiles of DNA-methylation, transcriptional activity, and genetic variation with plasma OT levels in 290 participants with ASD enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of OT. Our analysis identified genetic variants with novel association with plasma OT, several of which reside in known ASD risk genes. We also show subtle but statistically significant association of plasma OT levels with peripheral transcriptional activity and DNA-methylation profiles across several annotated gene sets.

The current double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, crossover trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03466671) was aimed to test the effect of TTA-121, a new formulation of intranasal oxytocin spray with an enhanced bioavailability (3.6 times higher than Syntocinon\u00ae spray, as assessed by area under the concentration-time curve in rabbit brains), which enabled us to test a wide range of multiple doses, on autism spectrum disorder core symptoms and to determine the dose-response relationship. Four-week administrations of TTA-121, at low dose once per day (3 U/day), low dose twice per day (6 U/day), high dose once per day (10 U/day), or high dose twice per day (20 U/day), and 4-week placebo were administered in a crossover manner. The primary outcome was the mean difference in the reciprocity score (range: 0-14, higher values represent worse outcomes) on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule between the baseline and end point of each administration period. This trial with two administration periods and eight groups was conducted at seven university hospitals in Japan, enrolling adult males with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder. Enrolment began from June 2018 and ended December 2019. Follow-up ended March 2020. Of 109 males with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder who were randomized, 103 completed the trial. The smallest P-value, judged as the dose-response relationship, was the contrast with the peak at TTA-121 6 U/day, with inverted U-shape for both the full analysis set (P = 0.182) and per protocol set (P = 0.073). The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule reciprocity score, the primary outcome, was reduced in the TTA-121 6 U/day administration period compared with the placebo (full analysis set: P = 0.118, mean difference = -0.5; 95% CI: -1.1 to 0.1; per protocol set: P = 0.012, mean difference = -0.8; 95% CI: -1.3 to -0.2). The per protocol set was the analysis target population, consisting of all full analysis set participants except those who deviated from the protocol. Most dropouts from the full analysis set to the per protocol set occurred because of poor adherence to the test drug (9 of 12 in the first period and 8 of 15 in the second period). None of the secondary clinical and behavioural outcomes were significantly improved with the TTA-121 compared with the placebo in the full analysis set. A novel intranasal spray of oxytocin with enhanced bioavailability enabled us to test a wide range of multiple doses, revealing an inverted U-shape dose-response curve, with the peak at a dose that was lower than expected from previous studies.

However, previous results on the efficacy of repeated administrations of oxytocin are controversial. Recently, we reported time-course changes in the efficacy of the neuropeptide underlying the controversial effects of repeated administration; however, the underlying mechanisms remained unknown. The current study explored metabolites representing the molecular mechanisms of oxytocin's efficacy using high-throughput metabolomics analysis on plasma collected before and after 6-week repeated intranasal administration of oxytocin (48\u00a0IU/day) or placebo in adult males with ASD (N\u2009=\u2009106) who participated in a multi-center, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial.

The Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test was acquired prior to the first scan to test whether OT effects were moderated by baseline social-emotional abilities. OT did not modulate behavioural performances but reduced activation in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus compared with placebo while inferring others' social emotions. Furthermore, the relationship between brain activation and task performance after OT administration was moderated by baseline social-emotional abilities. While task accuracy during inferring others' social emotion increased with decreasing activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus in CHR-P individuals with low social-emotional abilities, there was no such relationship in CHR-P individuals with high social-emotional abilities.

However, repeatable, objective, and quantitative measurement of autism spectrum disorder's core symptoms are lacking, making it difficult to examine potential time-course changes in efficacy. We tested this hypothesis using repeatable, objective, and quantitative measurement of the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. We examined videos recorded during semi-structured social interaction administered as the primary outcome in single-site exploratory (n = 18, crossover within-subjects design) and multisite confirmatory (n = 106, parallel-group design), double-blind, placebo-controlled 6-week trials of repeated intranasal administrations of oxytocin (48 IU/day) in adult males with autism spectrum disorder. The main outcomes were statistical representative values of objectively quantified facial expression intensity in a repeatable part of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule: the maximum probability (i.e. mode) and the natural logarithm of mode on the probability density function of neutral facial expression and the natural logarithm of mode on the probability density function of happy expression. Our recent study revealed that increases in these indices characterize autistic facial expression, compared with neurotypical individuals. The current results revealed that oxytocin consistently and significantly decreased the increased natural logarithm of mode on the probability density function of neutral facial expression compared with placebo in exploratory (effect-size, -0.57; 95% CI, -1.27 to 0.13; P = 0.023) and confirmatory trials (-0.41; -0.62 to -0.20; P < 0.001).

Here, to address this issue, we performed an exploratory, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial including 20 high-functional adult males with autism spectrum disorder. Data obtained from 18 participants who completed the trial showed that 6-week intranasal administration of oxytocin significantly reduced autism core symptoms specific to social reciprocity, which was clinically evaluated by Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (P = 0.034, PFDR < 0.05, Cohen's d = 0.78). Critically, the improvement of this clinical score was accompanied by oxytocin-induced enhancement of task-independent resting-state functional connectivity between anterior cingulate cortex and dorso-medial prefrontal cortex (rho = -0.60, P = 0.011), which was measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Moreover, using the same social-judgement task as used in our previous single-dose oxytocin trial, we confirmed that the current continual administration also significantly mitigated behavioural and neural responses during the task, both of which were originally impaired in autistic individuals (judgement tendency: P = 0.019, d = 0.62; eye-gaze effect: P = 0.03, d = 0.56; anterior cingulate activity: P = 0.00069, d = 0.97; dorso-medial prefrontal activity: P = 0.0014, d = 0.92; all, PFDR < 0.05).

Although difficulty in understanding of others' social emotions and beliefs under conditions without direct emotional cues also plays an important role in autism spectrum disorder, no study has examined the potential effect of oxytocin on this difficulty.

This task was modified from the Sally-Anne Task, a well-known first-order false belief task. The task was optimized for investigation of the abilities to infer another person's social emotions and beliefs distinctively so as to test the hypothesis that oxytocin improves deficit in inferring others' social emotions rather than beliefs, under conditions without direct emotional cues. In the case-control study, 17 males with autism spectrum disorder showed significant behavioural deficits in inferring others' social emotions (P = 0.018) but not in inferring others' beliefs (P = 0.064) compared with 17 typically developing demographically-matched male participants.

To directly examine whether oxytocin has beneficial effects on the sociocommunicational deficits of ASD using both behavioral and neural measures. At the University of Tokyo Hospital, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject-crossover, single-site experimental trial in which intranasal oxytocin and placebo were administered. A total of 40 highly functioning men with ASD participated and were randomized in the trial. Single-dose intranasal administration of oxytocin (24 IU) and placebo. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined effects of oxytocin on behavioral neural responses of the participants to a social psychological task. In our previous case-control study using the same psychological task, when making decisions about social information with conflicting verbal and nonverbal contents, participants with ASD made judgments based on nonverbal contents less frequently with longer time and could not induce enough activation in the medial prefrontal cortex. Therefore, our main outcomes and measures were the frequency of the nonverbal information-based judgments (NVJs), the response time for NVJs, and brain activity of the medial prefrontal cortex during NVJs. Intranasal oxytocin enabled the participants to make NVJs more frequently (P =\u2009.03) with shorter response time (P =\u2009.02).

In this study, we included 35 individuals with ASD aged 3-20\u00a0years from a previously published clinical trial of the probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive daily Lactobacillus plantarum probiotic (6\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>10</sup> CFUs) or a placebo for 16\u00a0weeks. The outcomes in this analysis include Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), Aberrant Behavior Checklist second edition (ABC-2), Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, SpCO measured by CO-oximetry, fecal microbiome by 16\u00a0s rRNA sequencing, blood serum inflammatory markers, autoantibodies, and oxytocin (OT) by ELISA. We performed Kendall's correlation to examine their interrelationships and used Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare the means of all outcomes between the two groups at baseline and 16\u00a0weeks. Elevated levels of serum anti-tubulin, CaM kinase II, anti-dopamine receptor D1 (anti-D1), and SpCO were found in the majority of ASD subjects. ASD severity is correlated with SpCO (baseline, R\u2009=\u20090.38, p\u2009=\u20090.029), anti-lysoganglioside GM1 (R\u2009=\u20090.83, p\u2009=\u20090.022), anti-tubulin (R\u2009=\u20090.69, p\u2009=\u20090.042), and anti-D1 (R\u2009=\u20090.71, p\u2009=\u20090.045) in treatment group. The findings of the present study suggests that the easily administered and non-invasive SpCO test offers a potentially promising autoimmunity and inflammatory biomarker to screen/subgroup ASD and monitor the treatment response to probiotics. Furthermore, we propose that the associations between autoantibodies, gut microbiome profile, serum OT level, GI symptom severity, and ASD core symptom severity scores are specific to the usage of probiotic treatment in our subject cohort. Taken together, these results warrant further studies to improve ASD early diagnosis and treatment outcomes.

Naturalistic Developmental Behavior Interventions (NDBIs) are among the most effective, evidence-based, and widely used behavior interventions for autism. However, no research has been conducted on which of the several NDBI methods is most effective for parents and children with autism spectrum disorders. Therefore, we conducted a network meta-analysis to compare the specific effects of each type of parental-mediated NDBI on children's developmental skills and parent fidelity. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Medline, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), CINAHL, and Wanfang databases were searched from inception to August 30, 2023. A total of 32 randomized controlled trial studies that examined the efficacy of different NDBIs were included. Parents of children with ASD who received Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT) reported significant improvements in their children's social skills (SUCRA, 74.1%), language skills (SUCRA, 88.3%), and parenting fidelity (SUCRA, 99.5%). Moreover, parents who received Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) reported significant improvements in their children's language (SMD\u2009=\u20090.41, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.79) and motor skills (SMD\u2009=\u20090.44, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.79). In terms of the efficacy of improving parent fidelity, the results showed that the Improving Parents as Communication Teachers (ImPACT) intervention significantly improved parent fidelity when compared with the treatment-as-usual group (TAU) (SMD\u2009=\u20090.90, 95% CI: 0.39, 1.42) and the parental education intervention (PEI) (SMD\u2009=\u20091.10, 95% CI:0.28, 1.91).There was a difference in parent fidelity among parents who received PRT(SMD\u2009=\u20093.53, 95% CI: 2.26, 4.79) or ESDM(SMD\u2009=\u20091.42, 95% CI: 0.76, 2.09) training compared with PEI. In conclusion, this study revealed that parents can achieve high fidelity with the ImPACT intervention, and it can serve as an early first step for children newly diagnosed with ASD. It also showed that parent-mediated ESDM is effective in improving language and motor skills for children with ASD and can be used as part of the second stage of parent training. Parent-mediated PRT can also be used as a third stage of parent training with sufficient training intensity to further improve language, social, and motor skills., keywords: Humans, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Parents, Network Meta-Analysis, Child, Behavior Therapy, Social Skills, Child Development, Parenting, Child, Preschool, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Treatment Outcome"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

GI symptoms are of particular interest in this population due to prevalence and correlation with the severity of behavioural traits. Nowadays, there is lack of strong evidence about the effect of dietary interventions on these problems, particularly prebiotics. Therefore, we assessed the impact of exclusion diets and a 6-week Bimuno\u00ae galactooligosaccharide (B-GOS\u00ae) prebiotic intervention in 30 autistic children. The results showed that children on exclusion diets reported significantly lower scores of abdominal pain and bowel movement, as well as lower abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. and Veillonellaceae family, but higher presence of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bacteroides spp. In addition, significant correlations were found between bacterial populations and faecal amino acids in this group, compared to children following an unrestricted diet. Following B-GOS\u00ae intervention, we observed improvements in anti-social behaviour, significant increase of Lachnospiraceae family, and significant changes in faecal and urine metabolites. To our knowledge, this is the first study where the effect of exclusion diets and prebiotics has been evaluated in autism, showing potential beneficial effects.

Here we asked whether risperidone-associated improvement was related to changes in concentrations of inflammatory molecules in the serum of these subjects. Seven molecules were identified as worthy of further assessment by performing a pilot analysis of 31 inflammatory markers in 21 medication-free subjects with autism versus 15 healthy controls: epidermal growth factor (EGF), interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), interleukin (IL)-13, IL-17, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), IL-1 and IL-1-receptor antagonist. Serum concentrations of these markers were then established in a different set of subjects that participated in a double-blind, clinical trial and an expanded group of healthy subjects. In the first analysis, samples obtained from subjects with autism at baseline visits were compared to visits after 8-week treatment with placebo (n=37) or risperidone (n=40). The cytokine concentrations remained stable over the 8-week period for both risperidone and placebo groups. In the second analysis, we explored further the differences between medication-free subjects with autism (n=77) and healthy controls (recruited independently; n=19). Serum levels of EGF were elevated in subjects with autism (median=103 pg/mL, n=75) in comparison to healthy controls (75 pg/mL, n=19; p<0.05), and levels of IL-13 were decreased in autism (median=0.8 pg/mL, n=77) in comparison to controls (9.8 pg/mL, n=19; p=0.0003). These changes did not correlate with standardized measures used for a diagnosis of autism. In summary, risperidone-induced clinical improvement in subjects with autism was not associated with changes in the serum inflammatory markers measured. Whether altered levels of EGF and IL-13 play a role in the pathogenesis or phenotype of autism requires further investigation., keywords: Adolescent, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Antipsychotic Agents, Autistic Disorder, Biomarkers, Child, Child, Preschool, Double-Blind Method, Epidermal Growth Factor, Female, Humans, Inflammation Mediators, Interleukin-13, Irritable Mood, Male, Risperidone"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

In a randomized, double blind, complete cross-over design, 14 healthy cyclists exercised for 30-minutes at +10% of blood lactate threshold after ingesting: (1) a placebo, (2) a \u03b2<sub>1</sub>-preferential antagonist (10\u202fmg bisoprolol), or (2) a non-preferential \u03b2<sub>1</sub>\u202f+\u202f\u03b2<sub>2</sub>-antagonist (80\u202fmg nadolol) across three trials separated by >7-days. Bisoprolol was administered to reduce hemodynamic forces (heart rate and blood pressure) during exercise to levels comparable with nadolol but without blocking \u03b2<sub>2</sub>-ARs. The mobilization of total NK-cells, terminally differentiated (CD57+) NK-cells, central memory, effector memory and CD45RA+ effector memory CD8+ T-cells; non-classical monocytes; and \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells were significantly blunted or abrogated under nadolol compared to both bisoprolol and placebo, indicating that the exercise-induced mobilization of these cell types to the blood is largely influenced by \u03b2<sub>2</sub>-AR signaling. Nadolol failed to inhibit the mobilization of classical monocytes, CD4+ T-cells (and their subsets) or na\u00efve CD8+ T-cells, indicating that these cell types are mobilized with exercise independently of the \u03b2<sub>2</sub>-AR. We conclude that the preferential mobilization of NK-cells, non-classical monocytes and differentiated subsets of CD8+ T-cells with exercise is largely dependent on catecholamine signaling through the \u03b2<sub>2</sub>-AR.

Forty-nine patients were enrolled in the study, and forty children completed the trial (dropouts: placebo\u00a0=\u00a04, riluzole\u00a0=\u00a05). A significantly greater improvement in the study primary outcome (the ABC-C irritability subscale score) was achieved by the riluzole-treated children compared with the placebo group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Patients in the riluzole group also showed significantly greater improvement on the lethargy/social withdrawal (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02), stereotypic behavior (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03), and hyperactivity/non-compliance subscales (P\u00a0=\u00a00.005), but not on the inappropriate speech subscale (P\u00a0=\u00a00.20) than patients in the placebo group. Eleven patients in the riluzole group and five patients in the placebo group were classified as responders based on their CGI-I scores [\u03c7(2)(1)\u00a0=\u00a03.750, P\u00a0=\u00a00.05]. Children in the riluzole group experienced significantly more increases in their appetite and bodyweight than children in the placebo group by the end of the study. Riluzole add-on therapy shows several therapeutic outcomes, particularly for improving irritability, in children with autism. However, its add-on to risperidone also results in significantly increased appetite and weight gain., keywords: Antipsychotic Agents, Appetite, Autistic Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Double-Blind Method, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Humans, Irritable Mood, Male, Neuroprotective Agents, Riluzole, Risperidone, Treatment Outcome, Weight Gain"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

Our aims were (1) to evaluate demographic and clinical characteristics as predictors of parent attendance and engagement in PT and (2) to examine the associations of parent attendance and engagement in PT with study-targeted child behavior outcomes (i.e., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] and disruptive behavior symptoms). TOSCA was a randomized clinical trial evaluating the effect of placebo versus risperidone when added to PT and psychostimulant for childhood ADHD with severe aggression. Data for 167 parents and children 6-12 years old with ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) or conduct disorder, and severe physical aggression were examined. Analyses used generalized linear models. Most parents (72%) attended seven or more of nine sessions. The average parental engagement, that is, the percentage of PT elements fully achieved across participants and sessions, was 85%. The average therapist rating of goal completion was 92%. Parents of non-white and/or Hispanic children (p\u2009=\u20090.01) and children with lower intelligence quotient (p\u2009=\u20090.02) had lower PT attendance; parents with lower family incomes (p\u2009=\u20090.01) were less engaged.

This article summarizes the clinical implications; reanalyzes the data to examine the utility of 4 criteria for deciding to augment; and presents a treatment algorithm. The newly analyzed 4 criteria for augmenting after 3 weeks of stimulant and PT treatment consisted of not meeting a Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) score of 1 and a normal score (\u226415) on the Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form Disruptive-Total (D-Total); a CGI-I score of 1 or 2 plus 25% improvement in D-Total score; a D-Total score no higher than 15; and a CGI-Severity score of 3 (mild) or better. Effect sizes were calculated. Prior TOSCA publications were reviewed for clinically relevant findings. All 4 criteria resulted in medium or better effect sizes (d\u00a0= 0.59-0.72) when comparing risperidone with placebo. Providing risperidone to children who did not reach a CGI-I score of 1 plus a D-Total score no higher than 15 resulted in the greatest benefit. In addition, a review of clinically relevant data suggests that stimulant plus PT shows further improvement after 3 weeks even without augmentation. For those children who did not attain a CGI-I score of 1 and a D-total score no higher than 15, adding risperidone maximized the number of children benefitting from treatment and the average amount of benefit. Unless clinical circumstances dictate otherwise, practitioners should delay an antipsychotic drug for at least 1 month after the optimal stimulant dose is achieved and PT has commenced.

In this 6 month (26 week) open-label extension (OLE) study, patients (5-17 years of age, who completed the previous fixed-dose, 6 week, double-blind [DB] phase) were flexibly dosed with risperidone based on body weight. The maximum allowed dose was 1.25 mg/day for those weighing 20 to <45 kg, and 1.75 mg/day for those weighing \u2265 45 kg. The study primarily assessed risperidone's safety; efficacy was assessed as a secondary end-point. Fifty-six (71%) out of 79 enrolled patients completed the OLE; the most common discontinuations were for insufficient response (7 [9%]) or adverse events (AE) (5 [6%]). The most common (\u2265 5% frequency in the total group) AEs were increased appetite (11% [n=9]); increased weight and vomiting (9% [n=7] each); sedation, pyrexia, and upper respiratory tract infection (8% [n=6] each); nasopharyngitis (6% [n=5]); and somnolence and fatigue (5% [n=4] each). Extrapyramidal AEs were reported in 6 (8%) patients. Increase in mean weight (11-15%) and body mass index (5-10%) occurred; one patient discontinued because of weight increase. One potentially prolactin-related AE (irregular menstruation) was reported. The risperidone high-dose group had the greatest mean improvement in sleep visual analog scale (24.6). All groups showed additional improvement in efficacy scale scores during the OLE. During this OLE, safety findings with risperidone treatment (maximum weight-based dose of 1.25 mg/day or 1.75 mg/day) were consistent with those observed in the DB phase, and with the current safety information for risperidone in autistic, psychiatric, and behavioral disorders. Patients experienced some additional improvement in irritability and related behaviors.

Topiramate has attracted considerable attention as a treatment for the dependence on alcohol and stimulants. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of topiramate for methamphetamine dependence. This study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. In the present investigation, 62 methamphetamine-dependent adults were enrolled and randomized into two groups, and received topiramate or a placebo for 10 weeks in escalating doses from 50 mg/day to the target maintenance dose of 200 mg/day. Addiction severity index (ASI) and craving scores were registered every week. The Beck questionnaire was also given to each participant at baseline and every 2 weeks during the treatment. Urine samples were collected at baseline and every 2 weeks during the treatment. Fifty-seven patients completed 10 weeks of the trial. There was no significant difference between both groups in the mean percentage of prescribed capsules taken by the participants. At week six, the topiramate group showed a significantly lower proportion of methamphetamine-positive urine tests in comparison with the placebo group (P = 0.01). In addition, there were significantly lower scores in the topiramate group in comparison with the placebo group in two domains of ASI: drug use severity (P < 0.001) and drug need (P < 0.001).

Methods<i>:</i> Seventy-three New Zealand children with ASD (2.5-8.0 years) completed a 12-month randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D (VID, 2000 IU/day), omega-3 LCPUFA; (OM, 722 mg/day docosahexaenoic acid), or both (VIDOM). Non-fasting baseline plasma interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) was available for 67 children (VID = 15, OM = 21, VIDOM = 15, placebo = 16). Children were categorised as having undetectable/normal IL-1\u03b2 (<3.2 pg/ml, <i>n</i>=15) or elevated IL-1\u03b2 (\u22653.2 pg/mL, <i>n</i> = 52). The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) questionnaire was used to assess core symptoms of ASD (baseline, 12-month). Mixed model repeated measure analyses (including all children or only children with elevated IL-1\u03b2) were used. We found evidence for an interaction between baseline IL-1\u03b2 and treatment response for SRS-total, SRS-social communicative functioning, SRS-awareness and SRS-communication (all <i>P</i><sub>interaction</sub> < 0.10). When all children were included in the analysis, two outcome comparisons (treatments vs. placebo) showed greater improvements: VID, no effect (all <i>P</i> > 0.10); OM and VIDOM (<i>P</i> = 0.01) for SRS-awareness. When only children with elevated IL-1\u03b2 were included, five outcomes showed greater improvements: OM (<i>P</i> = 0.01) for SRS-total; OM (<i>P</i> = 0.03) for SRS-social communicative functioning; VID (<i>P</i> = 0.01), OM (<i>P</i> = 0.003) and VIDOM (<i>P</i> = 0.01) for SRS-awareness. Inflammatory state may have modulated responses to vitamin D and omega-3 LCPUFA intervention in children with ASD, suggesting children with elevated inflammation may benefit more from daily vitamin D and omega-3 LCPUFA supplementation., keywords: Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Fatty Acids, Omega-3, Female, Humans, Inflammation, Interleukin-1beta, Male, Pilot Projects, Surveys and Questionnaires, Vitamin D"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

One reason for therapeutic failure or adverse effects is caused by genetic variations in the cytochrome P450 drug-metabolizing genes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of CYP2D6 polymorphisms on steady-state serum concentrations of antipsychotics metabolized by CYP2D6, taking into account the co-medication with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Serum and EDTA samples were collected from 82 psychiatric patients. After a liquid-liquid extraction, serum samples were analyzed using an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (UHPLC-MS/MS) method for quantification of the antipsychotics. CYP2D6 genotyping was performed using the Luminex xTAG\u00ae CYP2D6 Kit v3 (Luminex Corporation). Patients were divided into five phenotype subgroups by calculation of the activity score (AS): poor metabolizers (PM; AS 0), intermediate metabolizers (IM; AS 0.5-1), extensive metabolizers with slow activity (EM-s; AS 1-1.5), extensive metabolizers with fast activity (EM-f; AS 2), and ultra-rapid metabolizers (UM; AS >2).

Our secondary hypothesis was that the usual doses of zuclopenthixol and/or clonazepam would decrease in the venlafaxine-treated group. In a randomized double-blind study, we compared six patients who received venlafaxine along with their usual treatment (zuclopenthixol and/or clonazepam) with seven patients who received placebo plus usual care. Irritability, hyperactivity/noncompliance, and overall clinical improvement were measured after 2 and 8 weeks, using validated clinical scales. Univariate analyses showed that the symptom of irritability improved in the entire sample (p = 0.023 after 2 weeks, p = 0.061 at study endpoint), although no difference was observed between the venlafaxine and placebo groups. No significant decrease in hyperactivity/noncompliance was observed during the study. At the end of the study, global improvement was observed in 33% of participants treated with venlafaxine and in 71% of participants in the placebo group (p = 0.29).

This perspective aims to elucidate factors contributing to this variability and to highlight pitfalls and opportunities in the field. We identified two major factors: design-related elements and individual participant characteristics. Pertaining to design-related elements, optimal dosing regimens have yet to be established, but appear to favor moderate intervention durations (i.e., 4-6\u2009weeks) with intermittent and intermediate dosing (i.e., 24-32\u2009IU every other day). Also, the context of the intervention seems crucial, as enhanced outcomes are mainly observed when oxytocin administration is paired with a socially stimulating and supporting environment. In addition, more adequate outcome measures have to be established to effectively assess oxytocin's impact, including behavioral scales and objective biophysiological markers tapping into stress and neurophysiological regulation. Future research should also account for individual participant differences in biological sex, developmental stage and cognitive and adaptive functioning, and incorporate (epi)genetic screening to identify responders.

Previous research indicates that ASD without intellectual impairment is associated with underactivity and reduced functional connectivity of the brain's mentalizing pathway, to which the right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ) serves as an important entry point and hub. In this study, we aim to utilize functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to localize activation maxima in the rTPJ and other regions involved in social cognition to generate individualized targets for neuro-navigated, intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) in order to modulate brain activity in a region centrally engaged in social information processing. In this single-blind, randomized, between-subject neuroimaging-guided brain stimulation study we plan to recruit 52 participants with prediagnosed ASD and 52 controls without ASD aged between 18 and 65 years. Participants will be classified into two groups and will randomly receive one session of either verum- or sham-iTBS. Effects will be assessed by using well-established experimental tasks that interrogate social behaviour, but also use computational modelling to investigate brain stimulation effects at this level. This study aims to use personalized, non-invasive brain stimulation to alter social information processing in adults with and without high-functioning ASD, which has not been studied before with a similar protocol or a sample size of this magnitude.

We searched multiple electronic databases up to January 24, 2024. Meta-analyzable data from RCTs in the retrieved SRs/MAs were pooled using Metaumbrella. Primary outcomes were subjective/objective child sleep parameters. Additional outcomes included child health/functioning and parental sleep/health. The quality of the MAs/SRs was assessed with Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR-2), and the certainty of evidence using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE). We included 93 SRs/MAs covering 393 RCTs, with 25 (17%, 39%, and 30%: high, moderate, and low quality) providing data for quantitative synthesis. Behavioral interventions, usually multicomponent including parent training, psychoeducation, and/or specific sleep therapy/strategies, showed beneficial effects on night waking, sleep duration, overall sleep disturbance, mood/depression, and maternal sleep quality (standardized mean difference [SMD]\u00a0= 0.10-0.80) in participants with sleep problems without a formal sleep disorder diagnosis. For those with a formal diagnosis (mainly insomnia), benefits were found for night waking, sleep efficiency (subjective/actigraphically measured), and sleep onset latency (mean SMD\u00a0= 0.49-0.97). Those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) improved in bedtime resistance, night waking, parasomnias, sleep anxiety, ADHD symptoms, sleep disturbance, and quality of life (mean SMD\u00a0= 0.18-0.49). For those with autism, sleep disturbance improved (mean SMD\u00a0= 0.70). However, all findings were of low to very low certainty of evidence. Among nonpharmacological interventions for sleep difficulties in youth, only behavioral interventions are supported by meta-analytic evidence, yet with small-to-moderate effect sizes and limited certainty of evidence. This \"umbrella review\" (a review of reviews) analyzed 93 systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials examining nonmedication sleep interventions for children and adolescents. The authors found that behavioral interventions, including parent training and psychoeducation, had positive effects on sleep issues like night waking, with effect sizes ranging from small to moderate. Improvements were also seen in children with ADHD and autism. However, the quality of the evidence for these benefits was rated as low to very low. This suggests that while behavioral approaches may help, more robust evidence is needed to confirm their benefits.

The current feasibility study used MRI-derived diffusion imaging data to investigate whether it would be possible to identify neural biomarkers of a behavioral intervention among people diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The corpus callosum has been linked to cognitive processing and callosal abnormalities have been previously found in people diagnosed with ASD. We used a case-control design to evaluate the association between the type of intervention people diagnosed with ASD had previously received and their current white matter integrity in the corpus callosum. Twenty-six children and adolescents with ASD, with and without a history of parent-managed behavioral intervention, underwent an MRI scan with a diffusion data acquisition sequence. We conducted tract-based spatial statistics and a region of interest analysis. The fractional anisotropy values (believed to indicate white matter integrity) in the posterior corpus callosum was significantly different across cases (exposed to parent-managed behavioral intervention) and controls (not exposed to parent-managed behavioral intervention). The effect was modulated by the intensity of the behavioral intervention according to a dose-response relationship. The current feasibility case-control study provides the basis for estimating the statistical power required for future RCTs in this field.

Two subgroups responded better to BIACA on the primary outcome measure and a third responded better to BIACA on a peer-social adaptation measure, while a fourth subgroup responded better to CC on a school-related adaptation measure. These findings suggest that the FFM may be useful in empirically identifying subgroups of children with ASD, which could inform intervention selection decisions for children with ASD and anxiety., keywords: Child, Humans, Female, Male, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Anxiety Disorders, Anxiety, Comorbidity, Treatment Outcome"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

ASD is characterised by challenges with socialisation and communication, and by stereotyped and repetitive behaviours. A stereotyped behaviour is one which is repeated over and over again and which seems not to have any useful function. ASD often co-occurs with mental health disorders, including obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). People with ASD may show certain cognitive differences (i.e. differences in ways of thinking) which influence their response to therapies. Thus, there is a need for evidence-based guidelines to treat mental health issues in this group. OCD,\u00a0a common condition characterised by repeated obsessional thoughts and compulsive acts, occurs with greater frequency in persons with ASD than in the general population. Genetic, anatomic, neurobiological\u00a0and psychological factors have been proposed to explain this co-occurrence. However, care should be taken to distinguish stereotyped and repetitive behaviours characteristic of ASD from obsessive compulsive acts in OCD. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the recommended treatment for OCD, but studies have suggested that this treatment may be less effective in those with OCD co-occurring with ASD. Hence, modifications to CBT treatment may be helpful when treating OCD co-occurring with ASD to optimise outcomes. To assess the effectiveness of behavioural and cognitive behavioural therapy for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in children and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We searched for studies in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, five other bibliographic databases, international trial registries and other sources of grey literature (to 24 August 2020). We checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews to identify additional studies missed from the original electronic searches. We contacted subject experts for further information when needed. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cross-over, cluster- and quasi-randomised controlled trials involving both adults and children with diagnoses of OCD and ASD. We included studies of participants with co-occurring conditions (i.e. those experiencing other mental illnesses or neurodevelopmental conditions at the same time), but we did not include individuals who had a co-occurring global learning difficulty. Treatment could be in any setting or format and include behavioural therapy (BT) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which may have been adapted for those with ASD. Comparator interventions included no treatment, waiting list, attention placebo (where the control group receives non-specific aspects of therapy, but not the active ingredient) and treatment as usual (TAU, where the control group receives the usual treatment, according to accepted standards). Three review authors independently screened studies for inclusion. The authors extracted relevant data from the one eligible study, assessed the risk of bias and certainty of evidence (GRADE). Outcomes of interest were changes in OCD symptoms and treatment completion (primary outcome), and severity of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and behavioural difficulties, as well as degree of family accommodation (secondary outcomes). We did not conduct meta-analyses as only one study met the selection criteria. We included only one RCT of 46 participants in our analysis. This study compared CBT for OCD in persons with high-functioning ASD with a control group who received anxiety management only. There were no differences in rates of treatment completion between the CBT (87%) and anxiety management (87%) groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.25; low-certainty evidence). Behavioural difficulties were not included as an outcome measure in the study.\u00a0This study showed that there may be a benefit at the end of treatment favouring CBT compared with anxiety management in OCD symptoms (mean difference (MD) -3.00, 95% CI -8.02 to 2.02), depression symptoms (MD -1.80, 95% CI -11.50 to 7.90), anxiety symptoms (MD -3.20, 95% CI -11.38 to 4.98), and quality of life (MD 5.20, 95% CI -1.41 to 11.81), but the evidence was of low certainty.\u00a0 AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence is limited regarding the efficacy of CBT for treatment of OCD in ASD. There is much scope for future study, not only examining the efficacy of CBT for OCD in ASD, but also the particular ways that OCD manifests in and affects people with ASD and the role of the family in treatment response., keywords: Adult, Anxiety, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Child, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Humans, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

Interventions using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to enhance or inhibit cortical excitability are under study for various targets, though the mechanistic effects of rTMS have yet to be examined in ASD. Here, we examined whether an excitatory rTMS treatment course modulates glutamatergic (Glx) or \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) metabolite levels in emerging adults with ASD. Twenty-eight participants with ASD and executive function impairment [23.3 \u00b1 4.69 years; seven-female] underwent two magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) scans of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). MRS scans were acquired before and after participants with ASD were randomized to receive a 20-session course of active or sham rTMS to the DLPFC. Baseline MRS data was available for 19 typically developing controls [23.8 \u00b1 4.47 years; six-female]. Metabolite levels for Glx and GABA+ were compared between ASD and control groups, at baseline, and metabolite level change, pre-to-post-rTMS treatment, was compared in ASD participants that underwent active vs. sham rTMS. Absolute change in Glx was greater in the active vs. sham-rTMS group [<i>F</i> <sub>(1,</sub> <sub>19)</sub> = 6.54, <i>p</i> = 0.02], though the absolute change in GABA+ did not differ between groups. We also examined how baseline metabolite levels related to pre/post-rTMS metabolite level change, in the active vs. sham groups. rTMS group moderated the relation between baseline Glx and pre-to-post-rTMS Glx change, such that baseline Glx predicted Glx change in the active-rTMS group only [<i>b</i> = 1.52, <i>SE</i> = 0.32, <i>t</i> <sub>(18)</sub> = 4.74, <i>p</i> < 0.001]; Glx levels increased when baseline levels were lower, and decreased when baseline levels were higher. Our results indicate that an interventional course of excitatory rTMS to the DLPFC may modulate local Glx levels in emerging adults with ASD, and align with prior reports of glutamatergic alterations following rTMS. Interventional studies that track glutamatergic markers may provide mechanistic insights into the therapeutic potential of rTMS in ASD. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> Clinicaltrials.gov (ID: NCT02311751), https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02311751?term=ameis&rank=1; NCT02311751., keywords: N/A"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

Yet there are few validated interventions that help to remediate or support autistic individuals' adverse sensory experiences. To date, both measurement of sensory experiences and the resulting interventions have been based on assumptions of neurological sensitivities and largely ignored the role of cognition. This study therefore sought to assess the feasibility of a new 8-week CBT-based group intervention for self-regulation of sensory processing difficulties. Seven cognitively able adolescents diagnosed with autism aged 11-16 years from one mainstream secondary school received the 8-week intervention. Measures of sensory reactivity, anxiety and repetitive behaviours were taken at baseline, post-intervention and follow-up, 8 weeks after the intervention had ceased. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were also conducted with adolescents and their parents to examine further the acceptability of the intervention. The results showed that the intervention itself was feasible - both in its implementation and its acceptability to participants. Qualitative analysis clearly showed that the intervention was effective in raising meta-conscious awareness and self-regulation in these autistic adolescents.

Study 2 was a randomized pilot evaluation of the effect of MBSR, compared to an active control intervention with social support and relaxation education (support/education; n\u2009=\u200956), on the World Health Organization QoL BREF, Disability, and Autism-Specific scales in adults with ASD. In Study 1, we replicated findings that mental HRQoL is worse in both men and women with ASD, compared to NT counterparts, but physical HRQoL is only worse in women with ASD. We present novel findings that older age is associated with better mental HRQoL in women with ASD only. In Study 2, MBSR improved disability-related QoL in adults with ASD over and above the support/education intervention, but both interventions improved mental HRQoL. Lastly, both interventions were more effective for HRQoL improvements in women with ASD. Findings encourage precision medicine approaches tailored to age and sex groups for best HRQoL outcomes in adults with ASD. gov Identifier: NCT04017793., keywords: Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Female, Humans, Male, Mindfulness, Pilot Projects, Quality of Life, Social Support, Stress, Psychological"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

We conducted a health technology assessment of internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) for adults with PTSD or ASD, which included an evaluation of effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness, the budget impact of publicly funding iCBT for PTSD or ADS, and patient preferences and values. We performed a systematic literature search of the clinical evidence. We assessed the risk of bias of systematic reviews using ROBIS and of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, and the quality of the body of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria.We performed a systematic economic literature search to summarize the economic evidence on the cost-effectiveness of iCBT for adults with PTSD or ASD. We did not conduct a primary economic evaluation on iCBT for adults with PTSD, as an existing cost-utility analysis is directly applicable to this research question. We did not conduct a primary economic evaluation on iCBT for adults with ASD, as there is limited clinical evidence on this topic and because evidence on iCBT for PTSD may be generalizable to iCBT for ASD at risk of progressing to PTSD. We analyzed the budget impact of publicly funding iCBT for adults with PTSD or ASD in Ontario over the next 5 years.To contextualize the potential value of iCBT for PTSD, we reviewed relevant literature on patients' preferences and values and spoke with people who have lived experience with PTSD to explore their values, needs, and priorities. We identified no studies on the use of iCBT for prevention of PTSD or studies on the use of iCBT to treat ASD, nor studies that directly compared iCBT with face-to-face CBT for the treatment of PTSD. We included one systematic review of the use of iCBT to treat PTSD (10 RCTs, N = 720). Overall, iCBT is more effective than wait-list (waiting for iCBT) or usual care alone for reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.60 [95% CI -0.97 to -0.24]; N = 560, 8 RCTs) (GRADE: Very low). Internet-delivered CBT is not more effective than non-CBT internet-delivered interventions for reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms (SMD = -0.08 [-0.52 to 0.35]; N = 82, 2 RCTs) (GRADE: Very low).We identified one economic evaluation on the cost-effectiveness of iCBT for adults with PTSD. For adults with PTSD, iCBT was found to be dominant (i.e., less costly and more effective) compared with usual care. The model used a Canadian public health care payer perspective, and there were no major limitations to the model structure, time horizon, or source of model inputs. The annual budget impact of publicly funding iCBT in Ontario over the next 5 years ranges from an additional $2.43 million in year 1 to $2.37 million in year 5, for a total additional cost of $16.53 million over the next 5 years. If treatment costs alone are considered, the annual budget impact ranges from an additional $3.37 million in year 1 to $17.84 million in year 5, for a total additional cost of $52.61 million over the next 5 years.Our review of the quantitative literature on patient preferences found that adults with PTSD may experience iCBT as a generally acceptable form of treatment, but there is uncertainty in the evidence due to incomplete follow-up in studies and variability in the nature and extent of the therapist-patient relationship. The 10 people we spoke with had all been diagnosed with PTSD. They reported on its negative impact on their quality of life, including difficulty in managing everyday activities, relationships, and employment. Participants viewed iCBT as beneficial to managing their PTSD symptoms but stressed the importance of combining it with face-to-face CBT. However, wait times for PTSD services are long, and out-of-pocket expenses could be a barrier for people without private insurance. Internet-delivered CBT may reduce the severity of PTSD symptoms compared with wait-list or usual care, but the evidence is very uncertain, and iCBT may have little to no effect on improving PTSD symptoms compared with non-CBT interventions delivered online, but here as well the evidence is very uncertain.For adults with PTSD, iCBT may be cost-effective compared with usual care. We estimate that publicly funding iCBT in Ontario would result in additional costs of between $2.37 million and $2.43 million per year over the next 5 years.People with PTSD seem to generally find iCBT as an acceptable treatment option. People with PTSD with whom we spoke viewed iCBT to be effective and recommended it be combined with in-person psychotherapy., keywords: Adult, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Humans, Internet, Ontario, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic, Stress Disorders, Traumatic, Acute, Systematic Reviews as Topic, Technology Assessment, Biomedical"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

In the present study, a personalized measure of autism-related symptoms using the Youth Top Problems (YTP) method (Weisz et al., 2011) was evaluated. Participants included 68 children with diagnoses of autism (ages 6-13 years), and their parents, who were randomized to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or enhanced standard community treatment (ESCT) addressing autism-related symptoms. At pretreatment, parents described their child's top autism-related problems (YTPs) in their own words and rated the severity of these problems on a Likert-type scale. Parents also made daily severity ratings on the child's top three YTPs for 5 days prior to treatment and 5 days following treatment while videorecording their child's behavior at home on each of these days. Trained observers coded these videorecordings, focusing on the same YTPs that the parents rated. Parents also completed standardized checklists of autism-related symptoms and general mental health symptoms. There was evidence of convergent and discriminant validity as well as good test-retest reliability for the YTP measures. YTP severity scores converged with the standardized measure of autism-related symptoms. Parent-reported YTP scores predicted observers' YTP scores at the daily level, and both parent-reported and observers' YTP scores decreased from pre- to post treatment. Observers' ratings of the videorecordings exhibited sensitivity to treatment condition. These applications of the YTP method are promising and may complement standardized symptom checklists for clinical trials focusing on autism-related symptoms.

Results were used to compare medications to cannabis as a proposed treatment. <b>Results:</b> The heterogeneity of ASD produces great difficulties in finding appropriate treatment, leading to many medication changes or treatment trials throughout a patient's life. Commonly prescribed medications display varying levels of efficacy, safety, and tolerability between patients and symptoms targeted. Some of the most common side effects cited are also considered the most troubling symptoms associated with ASD; aggression, anxiety, irritability, and a negative effect on cognition, leading many patients to discontinue use as the side effects outweigh benefits. Recent case reports and retrospective studies have displayed the potential efficacy, safety, and tolerability of cannabidiol (CBD)-rich medical cannabis use for treating both core symptoms of ASD and many comorbid symptoms such as irritability and sleep problems. Studies have also identified circulating endocannabinoids as a possible biomarker for ASD, providing another possible method of diagnosis. <b>Conclusions:</b> Currently, there are no approved medications for the core symptoms of ASD and only two medications Food and Drug Administration approved for associated irritability. Prescribed medications for symptoms associated with ASD display varying levels of efficacy, safety, and tolerability among the heterogeneous ASD population.

Our study aimed to explore the impacts of intermittent TBS (iTBS) over the bilateral posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) on intellectually able adults with ASD. In this randomized, single-blinded, sham-controlled crossover trial, 13 adults with ASD completed iTBS for 5 consecutive days over the bilateral pSTS and inion (as a sham control) in a 16-weeks interval and in a randomly assigned order. The neuropsychological function was measured with the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) for cognitive flexibility while the clinical outcomes were measured with both self-rate and parents-rate Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) before and after 5-day iTBS interventions. The results revealed significantly immediate effects of multi-session iTBS over the bilateral pSTS on parent-rate autistic symptoms in adults with ASD. The post-hoc analysis revealed the impacts of multi-session iTBS on cognitive flexibility were affected by baseline social-communicative impairment and baseline cognitive performance. Besides, the impacts of multi-session iTBS on clinical symptoms was affected by the concurrent psychotropic medication use and baseline autistic symptoms.

However, a link between oxytocin and trust in humans was discovered only in one early study. We hypothesized that there is a large interindividual variation in oxytocin sensitivity, and that such variation is one reason for the doubt surrounding the role of oxytocin in trusting behavior. Here, in a double-blind, prospective, case-control study, we administered intranasal oxytocin to participants of trust and risk games. We measured salivary oxytocin concentration, relating it to the amount of money transferred among participants (a proxy for trust) and the autism-spectrum quotient (AQ). A one-sided Fisher's exact test was performed to detect differences between the oxytocin and placebo groups in the proportions of investors who transferred the maximum amount of money. We discovered a tendency for participants who received oxytocin to transfer higher amounts of money to co-participants than those who received a placebo (<i>P</i> = 0.04). We also revealed a high degree of interindividual variation in salivary oxytocin concentrations after oxytocin administration. After stratifying the samples with respect to oxytocin sensitivity, oxytocin-sensitive participants in the oxytocin group also transferred higher amounts of money than those in the placebo group (<i>P</i> = 0.03), while such a tendency was not observed for oxytocin-insensitive participants (<i>P</i> = 0.34).

This study examines the implementation of Reciprocal Imitation Training (RIT)-an NDBI-by community Early Intervention (EI; IDEA Part C) providers serving toddlers from birth to 3\u2009years. Of the 87 EI providers enrolled from 9 agencies in 4 counties across Washington State, 66 were included in the current sample. A stepped-wedge design was used to randomly assign counties to the timing of RIT training workshops. Self-report measures of practice and self-efficacy regarding ASD care were collected at baseline (T1, T2) and 6-months and 12-months post-training (T3, T4). At T3 and T4, providers reported on RIT adoption and rated items about RIT feasibility and perceived RIT effectiveness; at T4, they also reported on child characteristics that led to RIT use and modifications. From pre-training to post-training, there were significant increases in providers' self-efficacy in providing services to children with ASD or suspected ASD. At T3 and T4, provider ratings indicated high levels of RIT adoption, feasibility, and perceived RIT effectiveness. At T4, providers indicated that they most commonly: (a) initiated RIT when there were social-communication or motor imitation delays, or an ASD diagnosis; and (b) made modifications to RIT by repeating elements, blending it with other therapies, and loosening its structure.

The majority of adult ASD patients suffer from comorbid conditions such as depression and anxiety. Therapy options for adult ASD patients are lacking, with presently no available evidence-based interventions in Germany. Recently, two interventions to improve social responsiveness have been published. FASTER (\"Freiburger Asperger-Spezifische Therapie f\u00fcr ERwachsene\" = Freiburg Asperger-specific therapy for adults) is a manualized group psychotherapy program including three modules on psychoeducation, stress regulation management, and non-verbal and verbal social communication training with videotaped tasks. SCOTT&EVA (\"Social Cognition Training Tool\", and its enhancement \"Emotionen Verstehen und Ausdruecken\" = understanding and expressing emotions) is a computer-based training program to enhance social cognition including video and audio material of emotional expressions and complex real-life social situations. Initial studies for both programs have shown good feasibility and efficacy. Three hundred sixty adult participants with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) will take part in a randomized controlled three-armed multi-center trial to prove the efficacy of manualized group psychotherapy and a manualized computer-based training program. Both interventions will be compared with a treatment as usual (TAU) group, aiming to establish evidence-based psychotherapy approaches for adult individuals with ASD. The primary outcome is evaluated by parents, spouses, or others who have sufficient insight into the respective participant's social communication and interaction, and will be measured with the Social Responsiveness Scale. First, each of both interventions will be compared to TAU. If at least one of the differences is significant, both interventions will be compared against each other. The primary outcome will be measured at baseline (T0) and 4\u00a0months after baseline (T1). The trial is the first to validate psychiatric therapeutic and training interventions for adult ASD patients in Germany. A trial is needed because the prevalence of ASD in adulthood without intellectual disability is high, and no evidence-based intervention can be offered in Germany.

This study compared modular cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with enhanced standard community treatment (ESCT) in terms of impact on the severity of autism-related symptoms. Children with ASD (N = 107; aged 6-13 years) were randomly assigned to a treatment condition (CBT or ESCT). Both treatments provided 32 therapy sessions. The CBT condition utilized a modular design, matching specific evidence-based treatment elements to each child's clinical needs (e.g., social-communication symptoms). The ESCT condition provided social skills training and cognitive behavioral training in a structured and linear group therapy format. The primary outcome measure was independent evaluator ratings of peer engagement during school recess using a structured and validated observation system. Parents also made session-by-session ratings on personalized autism-related symptom profiles throughout treatment. CBT outperformed ESCT on the primary outcome measure (p < .001; d = .50; 95% CI [.06, .93]) and the secondary outcome measure (p = .003; d = .87; 95% CI [.45, 1.27]).

The biological basis of these deficits is unknown but may include the serotonergic system, which is involved both in regulating EF in neurotypical populations and in the pathophysiology of ASD. We previously demonstrated that reducing serotonin by acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) shifts differences in brain function during performance of EF tasks towards control levels. However, ATD cannot be easily used in the clinic, and we therefore need to adopt alternative approaches to challenge the serotonin system. Hence, we investigated the role of the serotonergic modulator tianeptine on EF networks in ASD. We conducted a pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging study, using a randomized double-blind crossover design, to compare the effect of an acute dosage of 12.5\u00a0mg tianeptine and placebo on brain activation during two EF tasks (of response inhibition and sustained attention) in 38 adult males: 19 with ASD and 19 matched controls. Under placebo, compared to controls, individuals with ASD had atypical brain activation in response inhibition regions including the inferior frontal cortex, premotor regions and cerebellum. During sustained attention, individuals with ASD had decreased brain activation in the right middle temporal cortex, right cuneus and left precuneus. Most of the case-control differences in brain function observed under placebo conditions were abolished by tianeptine administration. Also, within ASD individuals, brain functional differences were shifted significantly towards control levels during response inhibition in the inferior frontal and premotor cortices. We conducted a pilot study using a single dose of tianeptine, and therefore, we cannot comment on long-term outcome. Our findings provide the first evidence that tianeptine can shift atypical brain activation during EF in adults with ASD towards control levels.

Increasingly, scientific evidence suggests a neurobiological basis of these emotional, social and cognitive deficits in individuals with ASD. The aim of this randomized controlled brain self-regulation intervention study was to investigate whether the core symptomatology of ASD could be reduced via an electroencephalography (EEG) based brain self-regulation training of Slow Cortical Potentials (SCP). 41 male adolescents with ASD were recruited and allocated to a) an experimental group undergoing 24 sessions of EEG-based brain training (n<sub>1</sub>\u00a0=\u00a021), or to b) an active control group undergoing conventional treatment (n<sub>2</sub>\u00a0=\u00a020), that is, clinical counseling during a 3-months intervention period. We employed real-time neurofeedback training recorded from a fronto-central electrode intended to enable participants to volitionally regulate their brain activity. Core autistic symptomatology was measured at six time points during the intervention and analyzed with Bayesian multilevel approach to characterize changes in core symptomatology. Additional Bayesian models were formulated to describe the neural dynamics of the training process as indexed by SCP (time-domain) and power density (PSD, frequency-domain) measures. The analysis revealed a substantial improvement in the core symptomatology of ASD in the experimental group (reduction of 21.38 points on the Social Responsiveness Scale, SD\u00a0=\u00a05.29), which was slightly superior to that observed in the control group (evidence Ratio\u00a0=\u00a05.79). Changes in SCP manifested themselves as different trajectories depending on the different feedback conditions and tasks. Further, the model of PSD revealed a continuous decrease in delta power, parallel to an increase in alpha power. Most notably, a non-linear (quadratic) model turned out to be better at predicting the data than a linear model across all analyses.

In addition to challenges caused by core symptoms, maladaptive behaviors such as aggression can be associated with ASD and can further disrupt functioning and quality of life. For adults with ASD, these behaviors can portend adverse outcomes (e.g., harm to others or to the individual with ASD, hindering of employment opportunities, criminal justice system involvement). This article reviews the scientific literature to provide an update on evidence-based interventions for aggression in adults with ASD. A search of the electronic databases CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycINFO was conducted using relevant search terms. After reviewing titles, abstracts, full-length articles, and reference lists, 70 articles were identified and reviewed. The strongest (controlled trial) evidence suggests beneficial effects of risperidone, propranolol, fluvoxamine, vigorous aerobic exercise, and dextromethorphan/quinidine for treating aggression in adults with ASD, with lower levels of evidence supporting behavioral interventions, multisensory environments, yokukansan, and other treatments. Additional randomized, controlled trials using consistent methodology that adequately addresses sources of bias are needed to determine which treatments are reliably effective in addressing aggression in adults with ASD. In the meantime, considering efficacy and adverse effect/long-term risk profiles, a practical approach could start with functional assessment-informed behavioral interventions along with encouragement of regular, vigorous aerobic exercise to target aggression in adults with ASD, with pharmacotherapy employed if these interventions are unavailable or inadequate based on symptom acuity., keywords: Adult, Aggression, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Communication, Humans, Quality of Life"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

Targeting individual MMPs may offer a safer therapeutic potential for several diseases. We assessed the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of FP-025, a novel, highly selective oral matrix metalloproteinase-12 inhibitor, in healthy subjects. Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were conducted. Study I was a first-in-man study, evaluating eight single ascending doses (SADs) (50-800 mg) in two formulations: i.e., neat FP-025 in capsule (API-in-Capsule) and in an amorphous solid dispersion (ASD-in-Capsule) formulation. In Study II, three multiple ascending doses (MADs) (100, 200, and 400 mg, twice daily) of FP-025 (ASD-in-Capsule) were administered for 8\u00a0days, including a food-effect evaluation. Ninety-six subjects were dosed. Both formulations were well tolerated with one adverse event (AE) reported in the 800 mg API-in-Capsule SAD group and seven AEs throughout the MAD groups. The exposure to FP-025 was low with the API-in-Capsule formulation; it increased dose-dependently with the ASD-in-Capsule formulation, with which exposure to FP-025 increased in a greater-than-dose-proportional manner at lower doses (\u2264\u00a0100\u00a0mg) but less proportionally at higher doses. The elimination half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) was between 6 (Study I) and 8\u00a0h (Study II). Accumulation of FP-025 was approximately 1.7-fold in the MAD study.

In our sample, 61 children with one of their parents completed the program. Half of the group received the intervention, and the other half had to wait until the yoga group completed their trial. The participants were asked to give their feedback immediately after program completion and at 6-week follow-up. Compared to the group that was waiting to receive the intervention, parents in the yoga group reported significant gains for their children in regulating their overall executive control immediately after the session and again at follow-up. The parents reported a reduction in some of the sleep problems post-treatment.

Within the tactile domain, atypical tactile reactivity (TR) is common, it emerges early, persists into adulthood, and impedes social interaction and daily functioning. Hence, atypical TR is a key target for biological intervention to improve outcomes. Brain mechanisms informing biological interventions for atypical TR remains elusive. We previously reported hyper-plasticity in the motor cortex in autistic adults and found that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), designed to strengthen inhibitory processes in the brain, reduced hyper-plasticity. Whether the primary sensory cortex (S1) is characterized by hyper-plasticity, which may underlie atypical TR in autism is unknown. We aim to test whether hyper-plasticity in the S1 underlies atypical TR in autism, and investigate if a single session of rTMS can safely reduce hyper-plasticity in S1 in autistic adults. Plasticity will be assessed in the left S1 with integrated paired associative stimulation and electroencephalography (PAS-EEG) paradigm in 32 autistic adults and 32 age-, sex-, and intelligence quotient-matched controls. Autistic participants will be further randomized (double-blind, 1:1) to receive a single-session of either sham or active 20 Hz bilateral rTMS over the S1 and the plasticity will be re-assessed over the left S1 on the same day. Atypical TR has been identified as one of the top clinical research priorities that can influence outcome in autistic population.

Recently, noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) methods, namely transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), have been examined as possible new therapeutic options for modifying the pathological neuroplasticity involved in neuropsychiatric disorders including ASD. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review on the therapeutic uses of tDCS and repetitive TMS (rTMS) in ASD patients. A systematic search was performed on Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane and Embase. Original articles reporting the use of tDCS or rTMS to treat ASD were screened and studied by two researchers independently based on PRISMA guidelines.

These studies comprised 6 case-reports, 9 non-controlled trials and 17 controlled trials which assessed NIBS effects on the three cognitive, behavioral and biological dimensions in ASD. Existing evidence demonstrates that NIBS methods could be helpful for treating some dimensions of ASD such as repetitive behavior, sociability or some aspects of executive and cognitive functions.

However, limited research has investigated the heterogeneity of the visual preferences in individuals with ASD. In the current study, we explored the visual preferences to different movement types (repetitive, biological, and random) in children with ASD using a paired preferential looking paradigm. Thirty-nine children with ASD and 37 typically developing (TD) children participated in our study, with their eye movements recorded as the index of visual preferences. We examined the differences of visual preferences between the ASD and TD group, and the heterogeneity of visual preferences within the ASD group. We found group differences between children with ASD and TD children: Overall, the ASD group preferred repetitive movements while the TD group preferred biological movements. We also detected heterogeneity of visual preferences within the ASD group: Although the majority of children with ASD preferred repetitive movements as previous studies reported, 9 out of 39 children with ASD preferred biological movements similarly as their TD peers. Moreover, the visual preference patterns were correlated with autistic symptoms, especially the socio-communicative impairments. Our study provided evidence of heterogeneity of visual attention and main visual preference to repetitive movements in children with ASD.

Stress associated with teaching is more critical among teachers teaching children with special needs in general and those with autism specifically, partly due to the heterogeneous nature of the disorders. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of Rational Emotive Occupational Health Coaching (REOHC) in minimizing job stress in teachers of children with autism (CWA). A group-randomized waitlist control-trial design was adopted. A sample of 87 teachers of CWA who participated in the study was randomized into the immediate intervention group (IIG) and waitlist group (WLG). Participants were evaluated on 3 occasions: pretest, post-test and follow-up. Three instruments (Occupational Stress Index, Perceived Occupational Stress Scale and Stress Symptom Scale) were used to measure dimensions of job stress. After the pretest exercise, the IIG participated in a 2-hour REOHC programme weekly for a period of 12 weeks. Post- and follow-up evaluations were conducted respectively at 2 weeks and 3 months after the REOHC programme. Those in WLG were exposed to the REOHC after the follow-up assessment. Data collected were analysed using t-test statistics, repeated measures analysis of variance and bar charts. Results revealed that the perceived stress and stress symptoms of the REOHC group reduced significantly over WLG at post-test, and follow-up assessments. Changes in the occupational stress index scores across pre-, post- and follow-up measurements were minimal and could not account for a significant difference between the IIG and WLG. It was concluded that REOHC is effective in reducing subjective feelings and physiological symptoms of job stress, even when the objective stressors remain constant among teachers of CWA and other employees who work in stressful occupational environments., keywords: Adult, Autistic Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Child, Child, Preschool, Children with Disabilities, Female, Humans, Male, Occupational Stress, School Teachers, Surveys and Questionnaires"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

The great strawman of autism has been so emphasized by the vaccine industry that it, and it alone, often appears in authoritative discussions of adverse effects of the MMR and other vaccines. By dismissing the chimerical vaccine/autism controversy, vaccine defenders often dismiss all genuinely neurological aftereffects of the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) and other vaccines, including well-documented events, such as relatively rare cases of encephalopathy and encephalitis. This report explains that autism is not a physical or neurological disorder. It is not caused by injury or disease of the brain. It is a developmental disorder that has no physical origins and no physical symptoms. It is extremely unlikely that vaccines are causing autism; but it is extremely likely that they are causing more neurological damage than currently appreciated, some of it resulting in psychosocial disabilities that can be confused with autism and other psychosocial disorders. This confusion between a developmental, psychosocial disorder and a physical neurological disease has played into the hands of interest groups who want to deny that vaccines have any neurological and associated neuropsychiatric effects. A review of the scientific literature, textbooks, and related media commentary is integrated with basic clinical knowledge. This report shows how scientific sources have used the vaccine/autism controversy to avoid dealing with genuine neurological risks associated with vaccines and summarizes evidence that vaccines, including the MMR, can cause serious neurological disorders. Manufacturers have been allowed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to gain vaccine approval without placebo-controlled clinical trials. The misleading vaccine autism controversy must be set aside in favor of examining actual neurological harms associated with vaccines, including building on existing research that has been ignored. Manufacturers of vaccines must be required to conduct placebo-controlled clinical studies for existing vaccines and for government approval of new vaccines. Many probable or confirmed neurological adverse events occur within a few days or weeks after immunization and could be detected if the trials were sufficiently large. Contrary to current opinion, large, long-term placebo-controlled trials of existing and new vaccines would be relatively easy and safe to conduct., keywords: Autistic Disorder, Humans, Measles, Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine, Mumps, Rubella"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

Intervention content is delivered online (approximately 8 hours) and supported by more than 7 consultations with a clinician. Parents will perform the social reciprocity intervention with their child (30 min per day). Assessments at four time points (baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months corrected age) will assess parent-infant interaction, parental mental health, infant development and early ASD markers.

Eye tracking data and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired on the first and sixth days. The real group showed significant improvement in emotion recognition accuracy after iTBS, but the change was not significantly larger than that in the sham group. Resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) between the rpSTS and the left cerebellum significantly decreased in the real group than the sham group after iTBS.

The use of ACT-informed parenting interventions offers another alternative to solely behavioural approaches but it remains relatively understudied and in need of further exploration. The current systematic review, which searched four databases, aimed to collate all ACT interventions that included parental therapeutic components in the treatment of various child presenting difficulties. The review also rated the methodological rigour of the ACT evidence-base for this type of treatment format. Twenty-seven individual studies covering a broad spectrum of presenting problems were included, comprising of 1,155 participants. A large proportion of studies were within-group designs with a smaller number using randomized controlled trials. The majority of studies reported improvements on either parent report symptoms regarding child physical or psychological functioning as well as parent-reported measures of stress, depression, and anxiety. Similar improvements were noted on a number of ACT mechanisms of change outcomes, including mindfulness, acceptance, and cognitive fusing. These gains were evident for parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders, chronic pain, and significant physical health difficulties. Maintenance or further treatment gains were often reported at follow-up. These positive findings are tempered by low levels of methodological rigour common in some of the studies included. Despite these limitations, ACT holds promise as a transdiagnostic intervention that can help with the parenting of children with a range of psychological and physical difficulties.

The biological basis of this is poorly understood but may include neurochemically mediated differences in the responsivity of key 'limbic' regions (including amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc)). Emerging evidence also suggests that ASD may be a disorder of brain temporal dynamics. Moreover, serotonin (5-HT) has been shown to be a key regulator of both facial-emotion processing and brain dynamics, and 5-HT abnormalities have been consistently implicated in ASD. To date, however, no one has examined how 5-HT influences the dynamics of facial-emotion processing in ASD. Therefore, we compared the influence of 5-HT on the responsivity of brain dynamics during facial-emotion processing in individuals with and without ASD. Participants completed a facial-emotion processing fMRI task at least 8 days apart using a randomised double-blind crossover design. At each visit they received either a single 20-mg oral dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram or placebo. We found that citalopram (which increases levels of 5-HT) caused sustained activation in key limbic regions during processing of negative facial emotions in adults with ASD-but not in neurotypical adults. The neurotypical adults' limbic response reverted more rapidly to baseline following a 5-HT-challenge. Our results suggest that serotonergic homoeostatic control of the temporal dynamics in limbic regions is altered in adults with ASD, and provide a fresh perspective on the biology of ASD., keywords: Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Cross-Over Studies, Emotions, Facial Expression, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Serotonin"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. We grouped studies for quantitative analysis according to study design, vaccine type (MMR, MMRV, MMR+V), virus strain, and study settings. Outcomes of interest were cases of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella, and harms. Certainty of evidence of was rated using GRADE. We included 138 studies (23,480,668 participants). Fifty-one studies (10,248,159 children) assessed vaccine effectiveness and 87 studies (13,232,509 children) assessed the association between vaccines and a variety of harms. We included 74 new studies to this 2019 version of the review. Effectiveness Vaccine effectiveness in preventing measles was 95% after one dose (relative risk (RR) 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.13; 7 cohort studies; 12,039 children; moderate certainty evidence) and 96% after two doses (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.28; 5 cohort studies; 21,604 children; moderate certainty evidence). The effectiveness in preventing cases among household contacts or preventing transmission to others the children were in contact with after one dose was 81% (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.89; 3 cohort studies; 151 children; low certainty evidence), after two doses 85% (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.75; 3 cohort studies; 378 children; low certainty evidence), and after three doses was 96% (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.23; 2 cohort studies; 151 children; low certainty evidence). The effectiveness (at least one dose) in preventing measles after exposure (post-exposure prophylaxis) was 74% (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.50; 2 cohort studies; 283 children; low certainty evidence). The effectiveness of Jeryl Lynn containing MMR vaccine in preventing mumps was 72% after one dose (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.76; 6 cohort studies; 9915 children; moderate certainty evidence), 86% after two doses (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.35; 5 cohort studies; 7792 children; moderate certainty evidence). Effectiveness in preventing cases among household contacts was 74% (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.49; 3 cohort studies; 1036 children; moderate certainty evidence). Vaccine effectiveness against rubella is 89% (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.42; 1 cohort study; 1621 children; moderate certainty evidence). Vaccine effectiveness against varicella (any severity) after two doses in children aged 11 to 22 months is 95% in a 10 years follow-up (rate ratio (rr) 0.05, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.08; 1 RCT; 2279 children; high certainty evidence). Safety There is evidence supporting an association between aseptic meningitis and MMR vaccines containing Urabe and Leningrad-Zagreb mumps strains, but no evidence supporting this association for MMR vaccines containing Jeryl Lynn mumps strains (rr 1.30, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.56; low certainty evidence). The analyses provide evidence supporting an association between MMR/MMR+V/MMRV vaccines (Jeryl Lynn strain) and febrile seizures. Febrile seizures normally occur in 2% to 4% of healthy children at least once before the age of 5. The attributable risk febrile seizures vaccine-induced is estimated to be from 1 per 1700 to 1 per 1150 administered doses. The analyses provide evidence supporting an association between MMR vaccination and idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura (ITP). However, the risk of ITP after vaccination is smaller than after natural infection with these viruses. Natural infection of ITP occur in 5 cases per 100,000 (1 case per 20,000) per year. The attributable risk is estimated about 1 case of ITP per 40,000 administered MMR doses. There is no evidence of an association between MMR immunisation and encephalitis or encephalopathy (rate ratio 0.90, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.61; 2 observational studies; 1,071,088 children; low certainty evidence), and autistic spectrum disorders (rate ratio 0.93, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.01; 2 observational studies; 1,194,764 children; moderate certainty). There is insufficient evidence to determine the association between MMR immunisation and inflammatory bowel disease (odds ratio 1.42, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.16; 3 observational studies; 409 cases and 1416 controls; moderate certainty evidence). Additionally, there is no evidence supporting an association between MMR immunisation and cognitive delay, type 1 diabetes, asthma, dermatitis/eczema, hay fever, leukaemia, multiple sclerosis, gait disturbance, and bacterial or viral infections. Existing evidence on the safety and effectiveness of MMR/MMRV vaccines support their use for mass immunisation. Campaigns aimed at global eradication should assess epidemiological and socioeconomic situations of the countries as well as the capacity to achieve high vaccination coverage. More evidence is needed to assess whether the protective effect of MMR/MMRV could wane with time since immunisation., keywords: Adolescent, Age Factors, Autistic Disorder, Chickenpox Vaccine, Child, Child, Preschool, Clinical Trials as Topic, Crohn Disease, Epidemiologic Studies, Humans, Infant, Measles, Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine, Mumps, Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Rubella, Seizures, Febrile, Vaccines, Attenuated"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

Growing evidence suggests that cognitive behaviour therapies and mindfulness-based therapies can help autistic individuals learn to manage feelings of anxiety but access to such therapies remains problematic. In the current pilot study, we examined whether existing online cognitive behaviour therapy and mindfulness-based therapy self-help tools can help reduce anxiety in autistic adults. Specifically, 35 autistic adults were asked to try either an existing online cognitive behaviour therapy (n = 16) or mindfulness-based therapy (n = 19) programme while a further 19 autistic adults served as a waitlist comparison group. A first important finding was that 23 of the 35 (66%) participants who tried the online tools completed them, suggesting that such tools are, in principle, acceptable to many autistic adults. In addition, adults in the cognitive behaviour therapy and mindfulness-based therapy conditions reported significant decreases in anxiety over 3 and to some extent also 6\u2009months that were less apparent in the waitlist group of participants. On broader measures of mental health and well-being, the benefits of the online tools were less apparent.

In this population, suicidal behaviour troubles patients, families, and specialists in the field because it is difficult to treat. At present, there is no documented effective therapy for suicidal behaviour in ASD (Autism Research 7:507-521, 2014; Crisis 35:301-309, 2014). Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) is an efficacious treatment programme for chronically suicidal and/or self-harm behaviour in patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (J Psychiatry 166:1365-1374, 2014; Linehan MM. Cognitive behavioural therapy of borderline personality disorder. 1993). This study will evaluate the efficacy of DBT in persons with ASD and suicidal/ self- destructive behaviour in a multicentre randomised controlled clinical trial. One hundred twenty-eight persons with autism and suicidal and/or self-harming behaviour will be recruited from specialised mental healthcare services and randomised into two conditions: 1) the DBT condition in which the participants have weekly individual cognitive behavioural therapy sessions and a 2.5\u2009h skills training group session twice per week during 6 months, and 2) the treatment as usual condition which consists of weekly individual therapy sessions of 30-45\u2009min with a psychotherapist or social worker. Assessments will take place at baseline, at post-treatment (6\u2009months), and after a follow-up period of 12\u2009months. The mediators will also be assessed at 3 months. The primary outcome is the level of suicidal ideation and behaviour. The secondary outcomes are anxiety and social performance, depression, core symptoms of ASD, quality of life, and cost-utility. Emotion regulation and therapeutic alliance are hypothesised to mediate the effects on the primary outcome. The results from this study will provide an evaluation of the efficacy of DBT treatment in persons with ASD on suicidal and self-harming behaviour.

We present the current state-of the art of evidence-based interventions for toddlers and preschool-aged children with ASD, specifically targeting the core symptoms and language development. We included studies on manualized developmental and behavioral interventions for children with ASD aged <7 years according to DSM-III(R), DSM-IV(TR), DSM-5, and ICD-10. The publication dates ranged from 1 January 2011 to 31 August 2018 or as included in the NICE-children guidelines. Studies were included by an iterative hierarchy: systematic review > randomized-controlled trial > clinically controlled trial. Outcome measures were core ASD symptoms and precursor abilities, or language abilities. The interventions were collated by (1) frequency and (2) approach. The studies focused on low-intensive interventions targeting parental synchrony, the child's initiations, reciprocity, joint attention, play and imitation skills as well as comprehensive interventions. Improvement of core ASD symptoms regarding social communication was observed for low-intensive training of parental synchrony and child's reciprocity as well as for low-intensive comprehensive developmental interventions implementing natural-learning paradigms. High-frequency discrete trial interventions did not improve social communication. Language abilities improved by comprehensive interventions.

However, the neural mechanisms of symptom alleviation, and benefit of MBSR beyond education/support groups are unknown.

Based on previous self-reflection literature in ASD, regions of interest (ROIs) were middle cingulate cortex (MCC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Only the MBSR group demonstrated significant reductions in depression, and neither group significantly changed in anxiety. Only the MBSR group increased activity of right MCC during\u00a0self-reflection, and the increase correlated with depression alleviation. There were no changes in vmPFC for the MBSR group or either ROI for the support/education group.

Evidence-based psychological interventions have been successfully adapted to treat co-occurring anxiety, but there is little evidence about the usefulness of adapted cognitive-behavioural therapy for depression. To the authors' knowledge, to date there have been no randomised trials investigating the usefulness of low-intensity cognitive-behavioural therapy for depression in autism. The objectives of the study were to (1) develop a low-intensity psychological intervention for depression adapted for autism, (2) assess the feasibility and patient and therapist acceptability of the intervention, (3) estimate the rates of recruitment and retention for a full-scale randomised controlled trial and (4) identify an appropriate measure of depression to be used in a full-scale randomised controlled trial. The study comprised a randomised controlled trial (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200970) with a nested qualitative evaluation (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200921). Seventy eligible and consenting participants were randomly allocated to guided self-help or to treatment as usual. Adult autism services in two NHS regions. Adults with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder with depression, that is, a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 items score of \u2265\u200910. People who had attended more than six sessions of cognitive-behavioural therapy in the previous 6 months were excluded. The low-intensity intervention (guided self-help) comprised materials for nine individual sessions, based on behavioural activation adapted for autism, facilitated by therapist guides (coaches) who were graduate-level psychologists who attended training and regular supervision. Treatment as usual was standard NHS care for depression. Outcomes were measured 10, 16 and 24 weeks post randomisation using self-report and interview measures of depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, social function and quality of life, and a health-care and service use questionnaire. As this was a feasibility study also designed to identify the most appropriate measure of depression, it was not possible to specify the primary outcome measure or outcome point a priori. The aims of the study were met in full. The guided self-help intervention was feasible and well received by participants and coaches. The majority of allocated participants attended the intervention in full. The most practical outcome point was determined to be 16 weeks. There were differential rates of attrition across the treatment groups: 86% of the guided self-help group remained in the study at 24 weeks, compared with 54% of treatment as usual group. The qualitative study suggested that guided self-help had enhanced credibility with participants at the point of randomisation. Inter-rater reliability of the interview measure of depression was less than adequate, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from the prespecified sensitivity to change analyses. The intervention was feasible and well received. Although this feasibility study was not a fully powered trial, it provided some evidence that the guided self-help intervention was effective in reducing depressive symptoms. A full-scale clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness trial of the intervention is warranted. Improvements to the intervention materials as a result of qualitative interviews. Stakeholder consultation to consider future trial design, consider strategies to improve retention in a treatment as usual arm and select a self-report measure of depression to serve as the primary outcome measure.

Based on the data of a randomized controlled feasibility study by Philips, Wennberg, Konradsson, and Franck (2018), secondary analyses were conducted. It was tested, if patients' (N\u00a0=\u00a046) levels of autistic traits were associated with treatment outcome measured in the course of and after treatment using interviews and self-report measures. Participants' autistic traits were not associated with the change in the severity of BPD throughout and at the end of the treatment. However, results showed associations between autistic traits and the change in patients' consumption of alcohol in the course of MBT. Furthermore, there was an association between autistic traits and the change in mentalizing capacity at the end of MBT, indicating that elevated autistic traits were associated with an improvement in mentalizing capacity. Autistic traits on a subclinical level do not appear to be a complicating factor in MBT for concurrent BPD and SUD. On the contrary, in terms of mentalizing capacity autistic traits might be associated with a larger potential for improvement or facilitate treatment outcome. Further research is needed to explore the role of higher autistic traits in treatment of this special patient group., keywords: Adult, Autistic Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, Comorbidity, Feasibility Studies, Female, Humans, Interpersonal Relations, Male, Mentalization, Psychotherapy, Group, Substance-Related Disorders, Treatment Outcome"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

With recent research advances in early identification that allow for pre-symptomatic detection of autism in infancy, scientists are looking forward to intervention during infancy. These advances may be supported by the identification of biologically based treatment and outcome measures that are sensitive and dimensional. The purpose of this review is to evaluate white matter neurodevelopment as a monitoring biomarker for early treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as used as exemplars. White matter has unique neurobiology, including a prolonged period of dynamic development. This developmental pattern may make white matter especially responsive to treatment. White matter develops aberrantly in children with ASD and FXS. Histologic studies in rodents have provided targets for FXS pharmacological intervention. However, pharmaceutical clinical trials in humans failed to garner positive clinical results. In this article, we argue that the use of neurobiological monitoring biomarkers may overcome some of these limitations, as they are objective, not susceptible to placebo effects, and are dimensional in nature. As the field moves towards earlier detection and early intervention for neurodevelopmental disorders, we encourage scientists to consider the advantages of using neurobiological features as monitoring biomarkers., keywords: Animals, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Biomarkers, Brain, Early Medical Intervention, Fragile X Syndrome, Humans, Neurodevelopmental Disorders, White Matter"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

To fully assess treatment efficacy, we examined rates of anxiety symptom change by age groups following either cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or treatment as usual (TAU). One hundred sixty-three children with ASD and ASD-related anxiety symptoms were randomly assigned to either CBT or TAU. Utilizing prediction by correspondence analysis (CA), we evaluated the age effect (defined in three groups; ages 6-9, 10-12, and 13-16) and the changes in correlations between age and anxiety severity levels over the course of treatment. Significantly greater anxiety symptom reduction was associated with CBT compared with TAU across the three age groups. Of particular note, the children ages 10-12 who received CBT showed the greatest improvement compared to all other groups. Late childhood, prior to adolescence, showed the best response to CBT for anxiety in ASD. These findings suggest that treatment programs need to more closely address developmental factors within narrower bands of age groups. The present results are limited in their generalization to the CBT efficacy for a specific age band (ages 10-12).

Psychological therapies are commonly used to treat school-aged youth with ASD; their efficacy has not been established. To compare the relative efficacy of 2 cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) programs and treatment as usual (TAU) to assess treatment outcomes on maladaptive and interfering anxiety in children with ASD. The secondary objectives were to assess treatment outcomes on positive response, ASD symptom severity, and anxiety-associated adaptive functioning. This randomized clinical trial began recruitment in April 2014 at 3 universities in US cities. A volunteer sample of children (7-13 years) with ASD and maladaptive and interfering anxiety was randomized to standard-of-practice CBT, CBT adapted for ASD, or TAU. Independent evaluators were blinded to groupings. Data were collected through January 2017 and analyzed from December 2018 to February 2019. The main features of standard-of-practice CBT were affect recognition, reappraisal, modeling/rehearsal, in vivo exposure tasks, and reinforcement. The CBT intervention adapted for ASD was similar but also addressed social communication and self-regulation challenges with perspective-taking training and behavior-analytic techniques. The primary outcome measure per a priori hypotheses was the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale. Secondary outcomes included treatment response on the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale and checklist measures. Of 214 children initially enrolled, 167 were randomized, 145 completed treatment, and 22 discontinued participation. Those who were not randomized failed to meet eligibility criteria (eg, confirmed ASD). There was no significant difference in discontinuation rates across conditions. Randomized children had a mean (SD) age of 9.9 (1.8) years; 34 were female (20.5%).

This has led some families and researchers to trial alternative remedies - including the non-intoxicating Cannabis sativa-derived compound cannabidivarin (CBDV). However, how CBDV affects the human brain is unknown. Previous (pre)clinical evidence suggests that CBDV may modulate brain excitatory-inhibitory systems, which are implicated in ASD. Hence, our main aim was to test, for the first time, if CBDV shifts glutamate and/or GABA metabolites - markers of the brain's primary excitatory and inhibitory system - in both the 'typical' and autistic brain. Our subsidiary aim was to determine whether, within ASD, brain responsivity to CBDV challenge is related to baseline biological phenotype. We tested this using a repeated-measures, double-blind, randomized-order, cross-over design. We used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to compare glutamate (Glx\u2009=\u2009glutamate\u2009+\u2009glutamine) and GABA\u2009+\u2009(GABA\u2009+\u2009macromolecules) levels following placebo (baseline) and 600\u2009mg CBDV in 34 healthy men with (n\u2009=\u200917) and without (n\u2009=\u200917) ASD. Data acquisition from regions previously reliably linked to ASD (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, DMPFC; left basal ganglia, BG) commenced 2\u2009h (peak plasma levels) after placebo/CBDV administration. Where CBDV significantly shifted metabolite levels, we examined the relationship of this change with baseline metabolite levels. Test sessions were at least 13 days apart to ensure CBDV wash-out. CBDV significantly increased Glx in the BG of both groups. However, this impact was not uniform across individuals. In the ASD group, and not in the typically developing controls, the 'shift' in Glx correlated negatively with baseline Glx concentration. In contrast, CBDV had no significant impact on Glx in the DMPFC, or on GABA+\u2009in either voxel in either group. Our findings suggest that, as measured by MRS, CBDV modulates the glutamate-GABA system in the BG but not in frontal regions. Moreover, there is individual variation in response depending on baseline biochemistry.

Treatment integrity was assessed for each session [delivery (by therapist), receipt (participant understanding), and enactment (home practice)]. Children and parents wore actigraphs and completed electronic diaries for 2-weeks to obtain objective and subjective sleep onset latency (SOL), total sleep/wake times (TST/TWT), and sleep efficiency (SE) at pre/post/1-month follow-up. Parents also completed the Aberrant Behavior Checklist [irritability, lethargy, stereotypy, hyperactivity, inappropriate speech (e.g., excessive/repetitive, loud self-talk)] at pre/post/1-month. Fifteen children completed all sessions. Average integrity scores were high [90%-delivery/receipt, 87.5%-enactment]. Parents found CBT-CI helpful, age-appropriate, and autism-friendly.

Currently, no technologies directly target these core social attention difficulties. This study examines the feasibility of automated gaze modification training for improving attention to faces in 3-year-olds with ASD. Using free-viewing data from typically developing (TD) controls (n\u2009=\u200941), we implemented gaze-contingent adaptive cueing to redirect children with ASD toward normative looking patterns during viewing of videos of an actress. Children with ASD were randomly assigned to either (a) an adaptive Cue condition (Cue, n\u2009=\u200916) or (b) a No-Cue condition (No-Cue, n\u2009=\u200919). Performance was examined at baseline, during training, and post-training, and contrasted with TD controls (n\u2009=\u200923). Proportion of time looking at the screen (%Screen) and at actresses' faces (%Face) was analyzed. At Pre-Training, Cue and No-Cue groups did not differ in %Face (P\u2009>\u20090.1). At Post-Training, the Cue group had higher %Face than the No-Cue group (P\u2009=\u20090.015). In the No-Cue group %Face decreased Pre- to Post-Training; no decline was observed in the Cue group. These results suggest gaze-contingent training effectively mitigated decreases of attention toward the face of onscreen social characters in ASD. Additionally, larger training effects were observed in children with lower nonverbal ability, suggesting a gaze-contingent approach may be particularly relevant for children with greater cognitive impairment.

SSGT has shown modest and heterogeneous effects. One of the major genetic risk factors in ASD is rare copy number variation (CNV).

Here, we analyzed the rare genic CNV carrier status for 207 children, of which 105 received SSGT and 102 standard care as part of a randomized clinical trial for SSGT. We found that being a carrier of rare genic CNV did not have an impact on the SSGT outcome measured by the parent-report Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS). However, when stratifying by pathogenicity and size of the CNVs, we identified that carriers of clinically significant and large genic CNVs (>500\u2009kb) showed inferior SRS outcomes at post-intervention (P\u2009=\u20090.047 and P\u2009=\u20090.036, respectively) and follow-up (P\u2009=\u20090.008 and P\u2009=\u20090.072, respectively) when adjusting for standard care effects.

Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (iCBT-I) could provide accessible and scalable treatment. Given the unique sensory- and information processing, and social challenges at play in autism, a tailored treatment approach may be essential to tackle sleep problems. Yet, interventions developed and tested specifically for autistic adults were scarce. Addressing this gap is crucial to meet the urgent need for effective insomnia treatments in this population. With this two-arm, parallel, superiority randomized controlled trial, we will assess the effectiveness of a guided iCBT-I intervention for adults (N\u00a0=\u00a0160) with autism and insomnia (i-Sleep Autism). In co-creation, i-Sleep Autism has been adjusted from an existing intervention (i-Sleep). Inclusion criteria are: age\u00a0\u2265\u00a018, an ASD diagnosis, and at least sub-threshold insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index \u226510). Participants are randomly assigned to either i-Sleep Autism or an information only waitlist control condition (online psychoeducation and sleep hygiene). After 6\u00a0weeks, the control group receives the intervention. Insomnia severity is the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include pre-sleep arousal, general mental health, depression, anxiety, daily functioning, and quality of life. Assessments will occur at baseline, mid-intervention (3\u00a0weeks), post-intervention (6\u00a0weeks), and at 6-month follow-up (the intervention group). Linear mixed-effect regression models are employed to evaluate the effectiveness of i-Sleep Autism, alongside exploration of potential moderators and mediators. This trial can reveal whether autistic adults with insomnia benefit from a guided e-health intervention.

The children, aged 2 to 6 years old, were suspected to have autism spectrum disorder (ASD) based on Pervasive Developmental Disorders Autism Society Japan Rating Scale (PARS) scores of 9 points or more. The investigation randomly assigned them to two groups-\"the intervention group\" and \"the control group\"-and carried out SSTP. The intervention group answered the questionnaire before and after intervention, three months later. The control group also answered the questionnaire 2 months before the intervention, before and after intervention. Thus, each group answered three times. The questionnaire used the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), a Parenting Style scale (PS), the Relationship Quality Index (RQI), and the Japanese version of a Maltreatment scale (JM). For effectiveness of the intervention before and after, an analysis of covariance was carried out on the scores from the first and second questionnaires in the intervention and control groups. For effectiveness 3 months after the intervention, a repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed on the scale scores from the first to the third questionnaire in the intervention group.Results\u3000The average age of the children was 3.7\u00b11.4 years old, and the average PARS score was 20\u00b16.8.

Specific areas of the brain that are involved in sensorimotor integration, such as the cerebellum and basal ganglia, are pathologically different in individuals with ASC in comparison to typically developing (TD) peers. These brain regions contain GABAergic inhibitory neurons that release an inhibitory neurotransmitter, \u03b3-Aminobutyric acid (GABA). Brain GABA levels are decreased in ASC. This study explored the effect of introducing a non-invasive GABA substitute, in the form of GABA Oolong tea, on sensorimotor skills, ASC profiles, anxieties and sleep of children with ASC. <b>Methods:</b> Nine children took part: (5 male, 4 female). Each child participated in three tea conditions: high GABA, high L-Theanine (a compound that increases GABA), placebo with low GABA. A double-blind, repeated measures design was employed. Measures were taken after each tea condition. Sensory and ASC profiles were scored using parental questionnaires. Motor skills were assessed using a gold standard coordination assessment. Sleep was monitored using an actiwatch and anxiety measured through cortisol assays.

One important resource in managing these heightened levels of negative affect is emotion regulation, which in turn depends upon the ability to recognize and understand one's own and others' mental states (referred to as mentalization or reflective functioning). In this study, parents of children with ASD either participated in a mentalization-based group intervention (N\u2009=\u200936) or a delayed treatment (N\u2009=\u200928). Compared to delayed treatment participants, parents in the mentalization-based group had increases in reflective functioning and in the belief that emotions can change. Moreover, they reported decreased behavioral and emotional symptoms in their children, and greater parental self-efficacy. These preliminary findings support previous studies, which have shown that mentalization-based interventions for parents lead to positive outcomes, and suggest that these findings may apply to a diverse population of parents such as those of children with broader autism phenotype or children with different neurological disorders.

To date, women have been seriously underrepresented in human oxytocin research, and it is not known whether the effects observed in male-only samples apply to women. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, we administered 24 IU intranasal oxytocin (and, on a separate occasion, a matching placebo) to 31 men and 40 women and then measured empathic accuracy. AQ was assessed at baseline (prior to drug administration). Replicating a 2010 study by Bartz et\u00a0al., oxytocin selectively improved empathic accuracy for men who scored higher on the AQ, whereas oxytocin did not benefit their lower AQ counterparts. Conversely, we found no effect of oxytocin on empathic accuracy for women (regardless of their AQ score). In addition to speaking to reliability, this research is important given interest in using oxytocin to augment social functioning in some psychiatric disorders marked by social cognitive impairments.

While mobile technology-based therapy can alleviate wait-lists and scale for increasing demand, few clinical trials exist to support its use for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) care. To evaluate the efficacy of Superpower Glass, an artificial intelligence-driven wearable behavioral intervention for improving social outcomes of children with ASD. A randomized clinical trial in which participants received the Superpower Glass intervention plus standard of care applied behavioral analysis therapy and control participants received only applied behavioral analysis therapy. Assessments were completed at the Stanford University Medical School, and enrolled participants used the Superpower Glass intervention in their homes. Children aged 6 to 12 years with a formal ASD diagnosis who were currently receiving applied behavioral analysis therapy were included. Families were recruited between June 2016 and December 2017. The first participant was enrolled on November 1, 2016, and the last appointment was completed on April 11, 2018. Data analysis was conducted between April and October 2018. The Superpower Glass intervention, deployed via Google Glass (worn by the child) and a smartphone app, promotes facial engagement and emotion recognition by detecting facial expressions and providing reinforcing social cues. Families were asked to conduct 20-minute sessions at home 4 times per week for 6 weeks. Four socialization measures were assessed using an intention-to-treat analysis with a Bonferroni test correction. Overall, 71 children (63 boys [89%]; mean [SD] age, 8.38 [2.46] years) diagnosed with ASD were enrolled (40 [56.3%] were randomized to treatment, and 31 (43.7%) were randomized to control). Children receiving the intervention showed significant improvements on the Vineland Adaptive Behaviors Scale socialization subscale compared with treatment as usual controls (mean [SD] treatment impact, 4.58 [1.62]; P\u2009=\u2009.005). Positive mean treatment effects were also found for the other 3 primary measures but not to a significance threshold of P\u2009=\u2009.0125. The observed 4.58-point average gain on the Vineland Adaptive Behaviors Scale socialization subscale is comparable with gains observed with standard of care therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized clinical trial to demonstrate efficacy of a wearable digital intervention to improve social behavior of children with ASD. The intervention reinforces facial engagement and emotion recognition, suggesting either or both could be a mechanism of action driving the observed improvement.

The current study investigated the use of eye tracking as a biomarker of treatment response in the context of a pilot randomized clinical trial of treatment for young children with ASD. Participants included 28 children with ASD, aged 18-48\u2009months, who were randomized to one of two conditions: Pivotal Response Intervention for Social Motivation (PRISM) or community treatment as usual (TAU). Eye-tracking and behavioral assessment of developmental functioning were administered at Time 1 (prior to randomization) and at Time 2 (after 6 months of intervention). Two well-established eye-tracking paradigms were used to measure social attention: social preference and face scanning. As a context for understanding relationships between social attention and developmental ability, we first examined how scanning patterns at Time 1 were associated with concurrent developmental functioning and compared to those of 23 age-matched typically developing (TD) children. Changes in scanning patterns from Time 1 to Time 2 were then compared between PRISM and TAU groups and associated with behavioral change over time. Results showed that the social preference paradigm differentiated children with ASD from TD children. In addition, attention during face scanning was associated with language and adaptive communication skills at Time 1 and change in language skills from Time 1 to Time 2. These findings highlight the importance of examining targeted biomarkers that measure unique aspects of child functioning and that are well-matched to proposed mechanisms of change.

Pivotal response treatment (PRT) is an effective intervention for targeting these skills; however, similar to other behavioral interventions, response to PRT is variable across individuals. Thus, objective markers capable of predicting treatment response are critically-needed to identify which children are most likely to benefit from this intervention. In this pilot study, we investigated whether structural neuroimaging measures from language regions in the brain are associated with response to PRT. Children with ASD (n\u202f=\u202f18) who were receiving PRT to target their language deficits were assessed with MRI at baseline. T1-weighted images were segmented with FreeSurfer and morphometric measures of the primary language regions (inferior frontal (IFG) and superior temporal (STG) gyri) were evaluated. Children with ASD and language deficits did not exhibit the anticipated relationships between baseline structural measures of language regions and baseline language abilities, as assessed by the number of utterances displayed during a structured laboratory observation (SLO). Interestingly, the level of improvement on the SLO was correlated with baseline asymmetry of the IFG, and the size of the left STG at baseline was correlated with the level of improvement on standardized parental questionnaires.

Although repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has been studied for neurodevelopmental disorders, there is no clear consensus on its therapeutic effects. This systematic review examined literature on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for children and adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders published up to 2018 using the PubMed database. The search identified 264 articles and 14 articles met eligibility criteria. Twelve of these studies used conventional repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and two studies used theta burst stimulation. No severe adverse effects were reported in these studies. In patients with autism spectrum disorder, low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and intermittent theta burst stimulation applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may have therapeutic effects on social functioning and repetitive behaviors. In patients with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation applied to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may target inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.

Multiple clinical trials support naturalistic developmental behavior interventions (NDBIs) that integrate ABA and developmental science and are considered best practices for young autistic children. The Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) is a comprehensive NDBI shown to improve social communication outcomes for young autistic children in several controlled efficacy studies. However, effectiveness data regarding NDBI use in community-based agencies are limited. This study uses a community-partnered approach to test the effectiveness of ESDM compared to usual early behavioral intervention (EBI) for improving social communication and language in autistic children served by community agencies. This is a hybrid type 1 cluster-randomized controlled trial with 2 conditions: ESDM and EBI. In the intervention group, supervising providers will receive training in ESDM; in the control group, they will continue EBI as usual. We will enroll and randomize 100 supervisors (50 ESDM, 50 EBI) by region. Each supervisor enrolls 3 families of autistic children under age 5 (n\u2009=\u2009300) and accompanying behavior technicians (n\u2009=\u2009200). The primary outcome is child language and social communication at 6 and 12 months. Secondary outcomes include child adaptive behavior, caregiver use of ESDM strategies, and provider intervention fidelity. Child social motivation and caregiver fidelity will be tested as mediating variables. ESDM implementation determinants will be explored using mixed methods. This study will contribute novel knowledge on ESDM effectiveness, the variables that mediate and moderate child outcomes, and engagement of its mechanisms in community use. We expect results from this trial to increase community availability of this model and access to high-quality intervention for young autistic children, especially those who depend on publicly funded intervention services. Understanding implementation determinants will aid scale-up of effective models within communities. Clinicaltrials.gov identifier number NCT06005285. Registered on August 21, 2023.

However, little is known if and how ASD specific behavioral interventions may affect neural processing in ASD. The aim of the current study was to investigate for the first time, whether the group-based social skills training SOSTA-FRA would elicit changes in neurophysiological correlates of social perception in high-functioning ASD individuals aged 8-17 years. Event-related potentials (ERPs) of a facial emotion recognition (FER) and a biological motion perception task were examined. ERPs were compared between a randomized intervention and a treatment as usual group at three time points (baseline, post-intervention, and at 3 months follow-up). A reduction of P100 amplitude in the right hemisphere and a trend toward reduced N200 latency in the biological motion task were found after the training only in the intervention group, whereas behavioral performance remained stable. Change in N200 latencies and parent-rated social responsiveness showed small but statistically nonsignificant correlations. No changes were observed regarding FER. Results indicate that the intervention changed neural correlates of social perception in ASD. Especially neural correlates of biological motion perception, which is an important prerequisite for successful social interaction, were sensitive to change. ERPs of social perception tasks that are impaired in ASD can well be used to objectively measure neural processing improvement by behavioral intervention.

LAY SUMMARY: It is well known that people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) process social information differently than other people and that these differences can also be seen in their brain activity. We also know that behavioral therapies, such as group-based social skills trainings can help people with ASD improve their behavior. But it is unclear how therapy changes social processing in the brain. The aim of our study was therefore to examine how neural processing of social stimuli changed after behavioral intervention. Comparing a group of children and adolescents that received the group-based social skills training SOSTA-FRA to a control group we found that the neural processing of human motion became faster and involved less brain resources after the intervention, while behavioral performance remained stable. No changes were seen for the processing of emotional facial expressions. We recommend that future studies should also analyze changes in brain function as well as behavioral changes as a secondary therapy outcome parameter., keywords: Adolescent, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Child, Evoked Potentials, Facial Recognition, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Motion Perception, Parents, Social Perception, Social Skills"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

Currently, there is no US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for these core symptoms. This article reviews the biological origins of the social function deficit associated with autism spectrum disorder and the drug therapies with the potential to treat this deficit. A review of the history of autism demonstrates that a deficit in social interaction has been the defining feature of the concept of autism from its conception. Abnormalities identified in early social skill development and an overview of the pathophysiology abnormalities associated with autism spectrum disorder are discussed as are the abnormalities in brain circuits associated with the social function deficit. Previous and ongoing clinical trials examining agents that have the potential to improve social deficits associated with autism spectrum disorder are discussed in detail. This discussion reveals that agents such as oxytocin and propranolol are particularly promising and undergoing active investigation, while other agents such as vasopressin agonists and antagonists are being activity investigated but have limited published evidence at this time. In addition, agents such as bumetanide and manipulation of the enteric microbiome using microbiota transfer therapy appear to have promising effects on core autism spectrum disorder symptoms including social function.

Trauma-related diagnoses such as acute stress disorder (ASD) or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may exacerbate suicide risk, particularly among service members psychiatrically hospitalized following suicide-related events. To date, treatments to address suicide risk and trauma symptomatology among service members within inpatient milieus have been nonexistent. To address this gap, a randomized controlled pilot trial of Post-Admission Cognitive Therapy (PACT) was conducted to evaluate a targeted cognitive-behavioral program among traumatized military personnel (N = 36) hospitalized following a recent suicide attempt. All participants met criteria for ASD or PTSD and were randomly assigned to receive either PACT and enhanced usual care (PACT + EUC) or EUC alone. PACT consisted of six 60- to 90-min individual psychotherapy sessions, adapted from Brown et al.'s (2005) cognitive therapy protocol for suicide prevention. Blinded follow-up assessments were conducted at 1-, 2-, and 3-months postpsychiatric discharge. The primary outcome was days until repeat suicide attempt. Secondary outcomes included depression, hopelessness, suicide ideation, and PTSD symptoms. Participants did not significantly differ in reattempt status. However, based on reliable change index analyses, a greater proportion of PACT + EUC versus EUC participants met criteria for clinically significant change on measures of depression (100% vs. 78%), hopelessness (83% vs. 57%), and PTSD symptom severity (100% vs. 38%), but not for suicide ideation (60% vs. 67%).

While there are no specific pharmacological or other physical treatments for autism, in recent years repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), a technique for non-invasive neuromodulation, has attracted interest due to potential therapeutic value. Here we report the results of a systematic literature review and meta-analysis on the use of rTMS to treat ASD. <b>Methods:</b> We performed a systematic literature search on PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, Bielefeld Academic Search, and Educational Resources Information Clearinghouse. Search terms reflected diagnoses and treatment modalities of interest. Studies reporting use of rTMS to treat core ASD or cognitive symptoms in ASD were eligible. Two researchers performed article selection and data extraction independently, according to PRISMA guidelines. Changes in ASD clinical scores or in cognitive performance were the main outcomes. Random effects meta-analysis models were performed. <b>Results:</b> We found 23 eligible reports, comprising 4 case-reports, 7 non-controlled clinical trials, and 12 controlled clinical trials, comparing the effects of real TMS with waiting-list controls (<i>n</i> = 6) or sham-treatment (<i>n</i> = 6). Meta-analyses showed a significant, but moderate, effect on repetitive and stereotyped behaviors, social behavior, and number of errors in executive function tasks, but not other outcomes. Most studies had a moderate to high risk of bias, mostly due to lack of subject- and evaluator-blinding to treatment allocation. Only 5 studies reported stability of these gains for periods of up 6 months, with descriptions that improvements were sustained over time. <b>Conclusions:</b> Existing evidence supports that TMS could be useful to treat some dimensions of ASD. However, such evidence must be regarded with care, as most studies did not adequately control for placebo effects. Moreover, little is known regarding the most effective stimulation parameters, targets, and schedules. There is an urgent need for further randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trials, with adequate follow-up periods, to test the efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation to treat these disorders. Available evidence must be regarded as preliminary and insufficient, at present, to support offering TMS to treat ASD., keywords: N/A"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

This paper presents a novel headband-type wearable device called <i>FaceLooks</i>, used for measuring the time of the face-to-face state with identity of the partner, using an infrared emitter and receiver. It can also be used for behavioral healthcare applications, such as for children with developmental disorders who exhibit difficulties with the behavior, by providing awareness through the visual feedback from the partner&rsquo;s device. Two laboratory experiments showed the device&rsquo;s detection range and response time, tested with a pair of dummy heads. Another laboratory experiment was done with human participants with gaze trackers and showed the device&rsquo;s substantial agreement with a human observer. We then conducted two field studies involving children with intellectual disabilities and/or autism spectrum disorders. The first study showed that the devices could be used in the school setting, observing the children did not remove the devices. The second study showed that the durations of children&rsquo;s face-to-face behavior could be increased under a visual feedback condition.

Preliminary evidence supports telehealth-delivered sleep intervention. However, no studies have evaluated brief telehealth sleep intervention. To address this, we evaluated telehealth delivery of the brief behavioural Sleeping Sound Autism intervention, using a two-armed, parallel-group, non-blinded, pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) design (trial registration: ANZCTR12620001276943). Sixty-one families of autistic children without intellectual disability (5-12 years, 46% female) with caregiver-reported moderate-severe behavioural sleep problems participated Australia-wide, randomised to an intervention (n\u00a0=\u00a030) or treatment as usual control group (n\u00a0=\u00a031). Intervention group participants were invited to attend two video-conference telehealth sessions and one follow-up phone call with a trained clinician. Survey data was collected from caregivers at baseline and three- and six-months post-randomisation, to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy. Ten intervention group caregivers participated in end-of-study semi-structured interviews to explore their experiences. Forty-nine caregivers completed surveys. At baseline, 87% felt positive and 84% felt confident about participating via telehealth, and 75% believed the program would improve child sleep. At three-months, intervention group caregivers (n\u00a0=\u00a024) reported the usefulness (100%) of and preference for (71%) telehealth, and 95.8% would recommend this sleep program to other families. A significant group by time difference was observed in child sleep (Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire) with large effect sizes (d\u00a0=\u00a00.87-1.05), emotion and behaviour (Developmental Behavior Checklist 2) with moderate effect sizes (d\u00a0=\u00a00.40-0.57), and caregiver mental health (Kessler 10) with small to moderate effect sizes (d\u00a0=\u00a00.60-0.28), favouring the intervention group (n\u00a0=\u00a023). There were no significant group differences in child (Child Health Utility instrument) or caregiver (Assessment of Quality of Life) quality of life. However, there were individual differences in the clinical significance of improved child sleep. Qualitative data showed that whilst telehealth was convenient for caregivers, without attenuating the benefits of most key intervention features, not all children were able to engage effectively with the clinician via telehealth. This first pilot RCT of a brief telehealth behavioural sleep intervention for primary-school-aged autistic children suggests that telehealth delivery is acceptable, feasible and likely efficacious in improving sleep in the short-term.

Some studies suggest that individual characteristics such as diagnosis (i.e., specific deficit clusters) or behavioral profiles may be important social outcome moderators. Given the interactive nature of group-based interventions, understanding how individual characteristics combine to influence outcomes for the group as a whole is an important next step. By using a multisite cluster randomized control trial (n = 274), the current study explores the impact that varying student characteristics have on outcomes of the Social Competence Intervention for Adolescents (SCI-A; Stichter, Herzog, Owens, & Malugen, 2016; Stichter et al., 2010) compared to outcomes of business-as-usual (BAU) practices. Researchers hypothesized that (a) SCI-A would be more effective than BAU in improving ratings of students' social functioning when students within groups were more similar to each other on relevant diagnostic and behavioral indicators, and (b) that within SCI-A only, more versus less homogenous groups would demonstrate greater social outcome gains. Results offer some support for these hypotheses: SCI-A was more effective in improving social communication and motivation when groups were diagnostically similar (ds > 0.55). Considering changes in social awareness and communication, SCI-A was more effective when groups were heterogeneous on socially competent behavior (ds > 1.32) and less effective when groups were heterogeneous on antisocial behavior (ds > 1.00). The authors discuss the implications and importance of research exploring factors such as group composition that may moderate intervention response in applied settings.

The duration of most available programs is relatively short, and extended training might lead to further improvement. This randomized controlled trial compared an extended 24-week version of the SSGT program KONTAKT with standard care. The weekly sessions gradually shifted in content from acquisition of new skills to real-world application of the acquired skills. A total of 50 participants with ASD (15 females; 35 males) aged 8-17\u00a0years were included. The study was conducted at two child and adolescent psychiatry outpatient units in Sweden. The primary outcome was the Social Responsiveness Scale-Second Edition (SRS-2) rated by parents and blinded teachers. Secondary outcomes included parent- and teacher-rated adaptive behaviors, trainer-rated global functioning and clinical severity, and self-reported child and caregiver stress. Assessments were made at baseline, posttreatment, and at 3-months follow-up.

At present, there are no curative or psychopharmacological therapies to effectively treat all symptoms of the disorders. Early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) is a treatment based on the principles of applied behavior analysis. Delivered for multiple years at an intensity of 20 to 40 hours per week, it is one of the more well-established treatments for ASD. This is an update of a Cochrane review last published in 2012. To systematically review the evidence for the effectiveness of EIBI in increasing functional behaviors and skills, decreasing autism severity, and improving intelligence and communication skills for young children with ASD. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, 12 additional electronic databases and two trials registers in August 2017. We also checked references and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. Randomized control trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) in which EIBI was compared to a no-treatment or treatment-as-usual control condition. Participants must have been less than six years of age at treatment onset and assigned to their study condition prior to commencing treatment. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.We synthesized the results of the five studies using a random-effects model of meta-analysis, with a mean difference (MD) effect size for outcomes assessed on identical scales, and a standardized mean difference (SMD) effect size (Hedges' g) with small sample correction for outcomes measured on different scales. We rated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We included five studies (one RCT and four CCTs) with a total of 219 children: 116 children in the EIBI groups and 103 children in the generic, special education services groups. The age of the children ranged between 30.2 months and 42.5 months. Three of the five studies were conducted in the USA and two in the UK, with a treatment duration of 24 months to 36 months. All studies used a treatment-as-usual comparison group.Primary outcomesThere is low quality-evidence at post-treatment that EIBI improves adaptive behaviour (MD 9.58 (assessed using Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS) Composite; normative mean = 100, normative SD = 15), 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.57 to 13.60, P < 0.0001; 5 studies, 202 participants), and reduces autism symptom severity (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.79 to 0.11, P = 0.14; 2 studies, 81 participants; lower values indicate positive effects) compared to treatment as usual.No adverse effects were reported across studies.Secondary outcomesThere is low-quality evidence at post-treatment that EIBI improves IQ (MD 15.44 (assessed using standardized IQ tests; scale 0 to 100, normative SD = 15), 95% CI 9.29 to 21.59, P < 0.001; 5 studies, 202 participants); expressive (SMD 0.51, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.90, P = 0.01; 4 studies, 165 participants) and receptive (SMD 0.55, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.87, P = 0.001; 4 studies, 164 participants) language skills; and problem behaviour (SMD -0.58, 95% CI -1.24 to 0.07, P = 0.08; 2 studies, 67 participants) compared to treatment as usual. There is weak evidence that EIBI may be an effective behavioral treatment for some children with ASD; the strength of the evidence in this review is limited because it mostly comes from small studies that are not of the optimum design. Due to the inclusion of non-randomized studies, there is a high risk of bias and we rated the overall quality of evidence as 'low' or 'very low' using the GRADE system, meaning further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.It is important that providers of EIBI are aware of the current evidence and use clinical decision-making guidelines, such as seeking the family's input and drawing upon prior clinical experience, when making recommendations to clients on the use EIBI.

Additional maternal and neonatal measures, including fasting plasma glucose and inflammatory markers, predicted neurophysiological outcomes. The metformin and insulin treatment groups had similar outcomes. These results suggest that GDM can contribute to subtle differences in child neurophysiology, and possibly cortisol secretion, persisting into early adolescence. Importantly, these effects appear to occur during second trimester, before pharmacologic treatment typically commences, and can be predicted by maternal insulin resistance. Therefore, earlier detection and treatment of GDM may be warranted.

Prenatal interventions to ameliorate that risk have yet to be established for clinical use. A systematic review of prenatal nutrients and childhood emotional development and later mental illness was performed. Randomized trials of folic acid, phosphatidylcholine, and omega-3 fatty acid supplements assess effects of doses beyond those adequate to remedy deficiencies to promote normal fetal development despite genetic and environmental risks. Folic acid to prevent neural tube defects is an example. Vitamins A and D are currently recommended at maximum levels, but women's incomplete compliance permits observational studies of their effects. Folic acid and phosphatidylcholine supplements have shown evidence for improving childhood emotional development associated with later mental illnesses. Vitamins A and D decreased the risk for schizophrenia and autism in retrospective observations. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation during early pregnancy increased the risk for schizophrenia and increased symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but in later pregnancy it decreased childhood wheezing and premature birth. Studies are complicated by the length of time between birth and the emergence of mental illnesses like schizophrenia, compared with anomalies like facial clefts identified at birth. As part of comprehensive maternal and fetal care, prenatal nutrient interventions should be further considered as uniquely effective first steps in decreasing risk for future psychiatric and other illnesses in newborn children.

This pilot study addresses this void by investigating neural and behavioral changes in a Phase I trial in young adults with high-functioning ASD who received an evidence-based behavioral intervention, Virtual Reality-Social Cognition Training over 5 weeks for a total of 10 hr. The participants were tested pre- and post-training with a validated biological/social versus scrambled/nonsocial motion neuroimaging task, previously shown to activate regions within the social brain networks. Three significant brain-behavior changes were identified. First, the right posterior superior temporal sulcus, a hub for socio-cognitive processing, showed increased brain activation to social versus nonsocial stimuli in individuals with greater gains on a theory-of-mind measure. Second, the left inferior frontal gyrus, a region for socio-emotional processing, tracked individual gains in emotion recognition with decreased activation to social versus nonsocial stimuli. Finally, the left superior parietal lobule, a region for visual attention, showed significantly decreased activation to nonsocial versus social stimuli across all participants, where heightened attention to nonsocial contingencies has been considered a disabling aspect of ASD. This study provides, albeit preliminary, some of the first evidence of the harnessable neuroplasticity in adults with ASD through an age-appropriate intervention in brain regions tightly linked to social abilities.

We also examined the relationship between outcome and dose of parent training, type of control group, and type of informant (parent and clinician). Outcomes were not significantly different based on dose of treatment. Comparing parent training to treatment-as-usual did not result in significantly different treatment effects than when parent training was compared to an active comparison group.

To achieve better quality of unbiased evidence for the effectiveness of ASD interventions, it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive review that covers studies with adequate quality standards, such as randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and different types of intervention In this study, we categorize interventions for ASD as behavioural, social-communication focused, and multimodal developmental based on Howlin's classification of early interventions for children with ASD. The aim of this study was to compare these three models and investigate the strengths and weaknesses of each type of intervention and to identify the approaches that contribute to a successful outcome for children with autism. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. We included RCTs targeting children with ASD 6 years old or younger. A random effects model was used to present the effect estimate for the outcomes. This study also performed combined meta-analyses of all the three models to investigate the overall effectiveness of the intervention programmes. 32 randomized controlled studies were found to be eligible for inclusion. The synthesized data included 594 children from 14 RCTs. There was no statistically significant difference in the effects on autism general symptoms between the social-communication-focused model and the multimodal developmental model (p = 0.83). The results suggest that there is evidence of an effect on 'reciprocity of social interaction towards others' (standard mean difference [95% confidential interval] = 0.53[0.29,0.78], p<0.01) and 'parental synchrony' (SMD = 0.99[0.70,1.29], p<0.01). The small number of studies included in the present study limited the ability to make inferences when comparing the three models and investigating the strengths and weaknesses of each type of intervention with respect to important outcomes. Since the outcome of 'reciprocity of social interaction towards others' could be a dependent variable that might be context-bound to interactions with the child's parent, we cannot conclude the interventions for pre-school children with ASD have significant effects on a generalized skill to engage in reciprocal interactions with others. However, the outcomes of 'reciprocity of social interaction towards others' and 'parental synchrony' may be promising targets for interventions involving pre-school children with ASD.

One question to be answered is how enduring its neuromodulatory effect could be. Twenty-four patients with ASD (mean age: 12.2 years) received 20 sessions of NIBS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC). They were randomized into two groups with two (G1) or three (G2) clinical evaluations before NIBS. Both groups had a complete follow-up at six months after the intervention, with the aim of determining the short-term outcome using the total score on the Autism Behavior Checklist, Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist, and the Autism Diagnostic Interview. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) was used in ASD patients aged <11 years, and repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) for 11-13-year-olds. Observation points were at one, three, and six months after completing all the sessions of NIBS. A significant reduction in the total score on the three clinical scales was observed and maintained during the first six months after treatment, with a slight and non-significant tendency to increase the scores in the last evaluation.

We used data from a randomized trial that tested the efficacy of the ESDM, which is based on developmental and applied behavioral analytic principles and delivered by trained therapists and parents, for 2 years. Parents were interviewed about their children's service use every 6 months from the onset of the intervention to follow-up (age 6 years). The sample for this study consisted of 39 children with autism who participated in the original randomized trial at age 18 to 30 months, and were also assessed at age 6 years. Of this sample, 21 children were in the ESDM group, and 18 children were in the community care (COM) group. Reported services were categorized and costed by applying unit hourly costs. Annualized service use and costs during the intervention and post intervention for the two study arms were compared. During the intervention, children who received the ESDM had average annualized total health-related costs that were higher by about $14,000 than those of children who received community-based treatment. The higher cost of ESDM was partially offset during the intervention period because children in the ESDM group used less applied behavior analysis (ABA)/early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) and speech therapy services than children in the comparison group. In the postintervention period, compared with children who had earlier received treatment as usual in community settings, children in the ESDM group used less ABA/EIBI, occupational/physical therapy, and speech therapy services, resulting in significant cost savings in the amount of about $19,000 per year per child. Costs associated with ESDM treatment were fully offset within a few years after the intervention because of reductions in other service use and associated costs.

This study is based on a retrospective review of medical records collected during the activities of psychological and psychosocial unit in the immediate aftermath of earthquake. In total, 529 participants completed the Impact of Event Scale Revised (IES-R) (pre e post treatment). In order to provide a comparison similar to a waitlist-like control group, a method of cohort analysis was applied. In addition, possible time dependent effect was tested.

To date, thioredoxin (TRX), an antioxidant protein, has been investigated as a marker for psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism but its relationship with depression is yet to be unknown. The aim of this study is to detect the TRX levels in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD), analyse the effect of rTMS (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation) application on TRX levels and display the relationship of TRX with cognitive areas. This study included 27 treatment-resistant unipolar depression patients and 29 healthy subjects. Patients were evaluated by Hamilton Depression Scale (HDRS), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HARS) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) before and after rTMS application. 23 of TRD patients were applied high-frequency rTMS over left DLPFC for 2 to 4weeks and plasma TRX levels of patients and healthy subjects were measured. No significant difference was determined between the TRX levels of patients and healthy subjects (p>0.05). After rTMS application there were significant decrease in severity of depression (p<0.001) and anxiety (p<0.001), and explicit improvement in cognitive areas (delayed memory, visual-spatial/executive abilities and language points) (all p<0.05). No difference was detected in TRX levels of the patients after rTMS application (p>0.005). High language scores of the patients were found to be associated with high TRX levels (p<0.005). Our study indicates that TRX levels cannot be used as a marker for TRD or rTMS treatment in TRD. In spite of this TRX levels have a positive correlation with language functions of the patients of TRD. More extensive studies are required to clarify the mechanism of action of TRX and the effect of TRX on cognitive functions., keywords: Adult, Biomarkers, Cognition, Depressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Neuropsychological Tests, Prefrontal Cortex, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Thioredoxins, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Treatment Outcome"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

This randomized controlled trial investigated the effects of the TTT program on (a) cognitive outcomes (i.e. psychosexual knowledge, and insight in interpersonal boundaries) and (b) behavioral outcomes (i.e. skills needed for romantic relationships and problematic sexual behavior). A total of 189 cognitively able adolescents with ASD, aged 12-18\u00a0years old, were randomized to an intervention condition (n\u00a0=\u00a095) or a waiting-list control condition (n\u00a0=\u00a094).

Linear mixed model analyses showed significant treatment effects for psychosexual knowledge and adequate insight in boundaries, both posttreatment and at follow-up. All adolescents increased significantly over time in their social responsiveness and decreased their problematic sexual behavior, irrespectively of condition. The TTT program was most effective for younger adolescents with ASD; following the TTT program resulted in higher psychosexual knowledge, and higher social functioning for these adolescents. The results of this study indicate that the TTT program is effective as a psycho-educational program to provide adolescents with ASD with the knowledge and insight they need to prepare themselves for a healthy psychosexual development.

Conventional techniques, though powerful, are observation-based and face resource limitations. Technology-assisted systems can provide a quantitative, individualized rehabilitation platform. Presently-available systems are designed primarily to chain learning via aspects of one's performance alone restricting individualization.

Our aim was to investigate if there are baseline characteristics of patients that moderate response or trial design features that impede the identification of efficacious interventions for ASDs.

Criteria included blinded randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in paediatric ASD, with at least 10 participants per arm or 20 overall, of oral treatments, including pharmacological interventions and dietary supplements. Random-effects meta-analysis of 1997 participants (81% male) identified three moderators associated with an increase in treatment response: trials located in Europe and the Middle-East; outcome measures designated primary status; and the type of outcome measure. Inconsistent reporting of baseline symptom severity and intellectual functioning prevented analysis of these variables. Qualitative synthesis of baseline characteristics identified at least 31 variables, with only age and gender reported in all trials. Biological markers were included in six RCTs. Few trials reported adequate baseline characteristics to permit detailed analysis of response to treatment.

It aims to combine new pathophysiologically based treatments with objective tests (stratification biomarkers) to predict which treatment may be beneficial for a particular person. Here we discuss significant advances and current challenges for this approach: rare monogenic forms of ASD have provided a major breakthrough for the identification of treatment targets by providing a means to trace causal links from a gene to specific molecular alterations and biological pathways. To estimate whether treatment targets thus identified may be useful for larger patient groups we need a better understanding of whether different etiologies (i.e., genetic and environmental risk factors acting at different critical time points) lead to convergent or divergent molecular mechanisms, and how they map onto differences in circuit-level brain and cognitive development, and behavioral symptom profiles. Several recently failed clinical trials with syndromic forms of ASD provide valuable insights into conceptual and methodological issues linked to limitations in the translatability from animal models to humans, placebo effects, and a need for mechanistically plausible, objective outcome measures. To identify stratification biomarkers that enrich participant selection in clinical trials, large-scale multi-modal longitudinal observational studies are underway. Addressing these different factors in the next generation of research studies requires a translatable developmental perspective and multidisciplinary, collaborative efforts, with a commitment to sharing protocols and data, to increase transparency and reproducibility., keywords: N/A"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, we show that OT administration in ASD increases activity in brain regions important for perceiving social-emotional information. Further, OT enhances connectivity between nodes of the brain's reward and socioemotional processing systems, and does so preferentially for social (versus nonsocial) stimuli. This effect is observed both while viewing coherent versus scrambled biological motion, and while listening to happy versus angry voices.

Presently, no therapies are available to effectively treat individuals with all of the symptoms of this disorder. It has been suggested that hyperbaric oxygen therapy may alleviate the biochemical dysfunction and clinical symptoms of ASD. To determine whether treatment with hyperbaric oxygen:1. improves core symptoms of ASD, including social communication problems and stereotypical and repetitive behaviors;2. improves noncore symptoms of ASD, such as challenging behaviors;3. improves comorbid states, such as depression and anxiety; and4. causes adverse effects. On 10 December 2015, we searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and 15 other databases, four of which were Chinese language databases. We also searched multiple trial and research registers. We selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of any dose, duration, and frequency for hyperbaric oxygen therapy compared with no treatment or sham treatment for children and adults with ASD. We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration, in that three review authors independently selected studies, assessed them for risk of bias, and extracted relevant data. We also assessed the quality of the evidence by using the GRADE approach. We included one trial with a total of 60 children with a diagnosis of ASD who randomly received hyperbaric oxygen therapy or a sham treatment. Using GRADE criteria, we rated the quality of the evidence as low because of the small sample size and wide confidence intervals (CIs). Other problems included selection bias and short duration or follow-up.Overall, study authors reported no improvement in social interaction and communication, behavioral problems, communication and linguistic abilities, or cognitive function. With regard to the safety of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (adverse events), they reported minor-grade ear barotrauma events. Investigators found significant differences between groups in total number of side effect events (Peto odds ratio (OR) 3.87, 95% CI 1.53 to 9.82) and in the number of children who experienced side effects (Peto OR 4.40, 95% CI 1.33 to 14.48). To date, there is no evidence that hyperbaric oxygen therapy improves core symptoms and associated symptoms of ASD. It is important to note that adverse effects (minor-grade ear barotrauma events) can occur. Given the absence of evidence of effectiveness and the limited biological plausibility and possible adverse effects, the need for future RCTs of hyperbaric oxygen therapy must be carefully considered., keywords: Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Child, Preschool, Cognition, Communication, Humans, Hyperbaric Oxygenation, Interpersonal Relations, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

However, neither biological functions of OXTR SNPs in ASD nor critical OXTR SNPs that determine oxytocin's effects on ASD remains known. Here, using a machine-learning algorithm that was designed to evaluate collective effects of multiple SNPs and automatically identify most informative SNPs, we examined relationships between 27 representative OXTR SNPs and six types of behavioral/neural response to oxytocin in ASD individuals. The oxytocin effects were extracted from our previous placebo-controlled within-participant clinical trial administering single-dose intranasal oxytocin to 38 high-functioning adult Japanese ASD males. Consequently, we identified six different SNP sets that could accurately predict the six different oxytocin efficacies, and confirmed the robustness of these SNP selections against variations of the datasets and analysis parameters. Moreover, major alleles of several prominent OXTR SNPs-including rs53576 and rs2254298-were found to have dissociable effects on the oxytocin efficacies.

Oxytocin (OT) and cortisol are key neuromodulators of biological and behavioral responses, show a synergistic effect, and have been implicated in the neuropathological profile in ASD. However, they are rarely investigated together. The purpose of the pilot study was to evaluate the relationship between cortisol and OT in children with ASD under baseline and physiological stress (hydrocortisone challenge) conditions. Arginine vasopressin (AVP), structurally similar to OT, was also examined. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomly assigned, crossover design was employed in 25 children 8-to-12\u00a0years with ASD (N\u2009=\u200914) or typical development (TD, N\u2009=\u200911). A low dose of hydrocortisone and placebo were administered via liquid suspension. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine the within-subject factor \"Condition\" (hydrocortisone/placebo) and \"Time\" (pre and post) and the between-subject factor \"Group\" (ASD vs. TD).

OT increased during physiological challenge suggesting that OT played a stress-buffering role during cortisol administration. In contrast for the ASD group, OT remained unchanged or decreased during both the physiological challenge and the placebo condition, suggesting that OT failed to serve as a stress buffer under conditions of physiological stress. While OT has been tied to the social ability of children with ASD, the diminished moderating effect of OT on cortisol may also play a contributory role in the heightened stress often observed in children with ASD.

We randomly assigned 3 children to ABA and 3 children to M-SOS and compared the effects of treatment in a multiple baseline design across novel, healthy target foods. We used a multielement design to assess treatment generalization. Consumption of target foods increased for children who received ABA, but not for children who received M-SOS. We subsequently implemented ABA with the children for whom M-SOS was not effective and observed a potential treatment generalization effect during ABA when M-SOS preceded ABA., keywords: Autism Spectrum Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Caregivers, Child, Child, Preschool, Early Intervention, Educational, Feeding Behavior, Female, Food Preferences, Humans, Male, Mouth, Sensation, Verbal Behavior"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

This was a 24-week, 6-site, randomized trial of parent training versus parent education in 180 children with ASD (aged 3-7 years; 158 boys and 22 girls) and moderate or greater behavioral problems. Parent training included specific strategies to manage disruptive behavior over 11 to 13 sessions, 2 telephone boosters, and 2 home visits. Parent education provided useful information about autism but no behavior management strategies over 12 core sessions and 1 home visit. In a previous report, we showed that parent training was superior to parent education in reducing disruptive behavior in young children with ASD. Here, we test whether parent training is superior to parent education in improving daily living skills as measured by the parent-rated Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales II. The long-term impact of parent training on adaptive functioning is also presented. At week 24, the parent training group showed a 5.7-point improvement from baseline on the Daily Living domain compared to no change in parent education (p\u00a0=\u00a0.004; effect size\u00a0= 0.36). On the Socialization domain, there was a 5.9-point improvement in parent training versus a 3.1-point improvement in parent education (p\u00a0=\u00a0.11; effect size\u00a0= 0.29). Gains in the Communication domain were similar across treatment groups. The gain in Daily Living was greater in children with IQ of >70. However, the interaction of treatment-by-IQ was not significant. Gains\u00a0in Daily Living at week 24 were maintained upon re-evaluation at 24 weeks posttreatment. These results support the model that reduction in disruptive behavior can lead to improvement in activities of daily living. By contrast, the expected trajectory for adaptive behavior in children with ASD is often flat and predictably declines in children with intellectual disability. In the parent training group, higher-functioning children achieved significant gains in daily living skills. Children with intellectual disability kept pace with time.

In this study, we focus on impairment of executive functioning in autism spectrum disorder patients and investigate improvements in executive functioning and their generalization to social functioning. The intervention adopted for this study was cognitive remediation therapy using the frontal/executive program. To investigate the effectiveness of frontal/executive program, 15 subjects who consented to participate in the study were randomly assigned to an intervention group or control group. Frontal/executive program was administered to the intervention group for about six months. Both groups were evaluated using the same scales: BACS-J, WCST, and CPT for cognitive assessment; SCoRS-J, GAF, and LASMI for social functioning; and GSE for self-efficacy. Both groups had lower scores for cognitive functioning than normal individuals at baseline. After completion of frontal/executive program, the intervention group showed improved performance on BACS-J for overall score, digit sequencing, verbal fluency, and Tower of London tasks. Improvements were also seen on SCoRS-J and LASMI scales of social functioning.

Among most mammals, the placenta is not effective at transferring antibodies to the fetus: antibodies are transferred immediately after birth via the colostrum. Among humans (and other mammals with hemochorial placentas) the transplacental transfer of antibodies (namely IgG) is effective. In humans, foetal concentrations of IgG sub-classes approximate to maternal concentrations at 38weeks and continue to increase thereafter. These facts explain inter-species differences regarding the basic needs of neonates. Among most mammals, the early colostrum is, strictly speaking, vital. Among humans, the main questions are about the bacteriological environment in the birthing place and how familiar it is to the mother. Today, most human beings are born in unfamiliar bacteriological environments characterized by a low microbial diversity. The effects of clinical environments may be amplified by the use of antibiotics and birth by caesarean, i.e. by-passing the bacteriologically rich perineal zone. There is already an accumulation of data confirming that the maturation of a balanced Th1/Th2 immune response is affected by the mode of delivery. There is also an accumulation of epidemiological studies detecting risk factors in the perinatal period for health conditions such as type 1 diabetes (and other autoimmune diseases), atopy, autism and obesity. In such a context there are reasons to plan randomized controlled trials with long term follow-up of the effects of BCG given immediately after birth, as a modulator of Th-1/Th-2 responses. A follow-up period in the region of 6-10years would be long enough to evaluate the prevalence of several nosologically well defined diseases. These studies would be ethically acceptable, since BCG is the only infancy vaccine that has been evaluated through randomised controlled trials with long term follow-up. Furthermore, whatever the standard of living of the populations and the research protocols, concordant results suggest that BCG has positive non-specific long term effects on health. Meanwhile, some simple adaptive practices are possible, such as, after a caesarean section, wrapping the neonate in clothes recently worn by the mother and, occasionally, putting the neonate in the arms of a person who is cohabiting with the mother., keywords: Animals, Antibodies, BCG Vaccine, Cesarean Section, Colostrum, Female, Fetus, Humans, Immunoglobulin G, Infant, Newborn, Parturition, Placenta, Pregnancy, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Risk Factors, Th1 Cells, Th2 Cells, Time Factors, Vaccination"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

It is characterized by exacerbated neuronal excitability, and its correction is considered an objective measure of treatment response in animal models, a marker albeit rarely used in clinical trials. Here, we used an extensive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) battery to assess the neurophysiological effects of a therapy combining two disease-modifying drugs, lovastatin (40\u2009mg) and minocycline (100\u2009mg), administered alone for 8\u2009weeks and in combination for 12\u2009weeks, in 19 patients (mean age of 23.58\u2009\u00b1\u20091.51) with FXS taking part in the LOVAmix trial. The TMS battery, which included the resting motor threshold, short-interval intracortical inhibition, long-interval intracortical inhibition, corticospinal silent period, and intracortical facilitation, was completed at baseline after 8\u2009weeks of monotherapy (visit 2 of the clinical trial) and after 12\u2009weeks of dual therapy (visit 4 of the clinical trial). Repeated measure ANOVAs were performed between baseline and visit 2 (monotherapy) and visit 3 (dual therapy) with interactions for which monotherapy the participants received when they began the clinical trial. Results showed that dual therapy was associated with reduced cortical excitability after 20\u2009weeks. This was reflected by a significant increase in the resting-motor threshold after dual therapy compared to baseline. There was a tendency for enhanced short-intracortical inhibition, a marker of GABAa-mediated inhibition after 8\u2009weeks of monotherapy compared to baseline. Together, these results suggest that a combined therapy of minocycline and lovastatin might act on the core neurophysiopathology of FXS.

In autism, a lack of preference for the eyes, as well as anatomo-functional abnormalities within the STS, has been described. To date, there are no experimental data in humans showing whether it is possible to interfere with eye-gaze processing by modulating STS neural activity. Here, we measured eye-gaze perception before and after inhibitory transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied over the posterior STS (pSTS) in young healthy volunteers. Eye-gaze processing, namely overt orienting toward the eyes, was measured using eye tracking during passive visualization of social movies. Inhibition of the right pSTS led participants to look less to the eyes of characters during visualization of social movies. Such effect was specific for the eyes and was not observed after inhibition of the left pSTS nor after placebo TMS. These results indicate for the first time that interfering with the right pSTS neural activity transitorily disrupts the behavior of orienting toward the eyes and thus indirectly gaze perception, a fundamental process for human social cognition.

This study extended upon this background by combining DCS with behavioral social skills therapy in youth with ASD to assess its impact on the core social deficits of ASD. We hypothesized that DCS used in combination with social skills training would enhance the acquisition of social skills in children with ASD. A 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of DCS (50\u00a0mg) given 30\u00a0min prior to weekly group social skills training was conducted at two sites. Children with ASD were randomized to receive 10\u00a0weeks (10 doses) of DCS or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. No statistically significant difference attributable to drug treatment was observed in the change scores for the primary outcome measure, the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), total score (p\u2009=\u20090.45), or on secondary outcome measures. The results of this trial demonstrated no drug-related short-term improvement on the primary outcome measure, or any of the secondary outcome measures.

Data from 36 participants from a recent evaluation of the SibworkS programme was used. Measures were administered pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention and three months post-intervention. Treatment effects were measured using change scores for siblings on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire - Parent Version (SDQ). Seven predictors were analysed: symptom severity of the child with special needs, participant age and gender, sibling birth order, family socio-economic status, participant baseline SDQ score and participant use of additional support services. The overall model significantly predicted change in SDQ scores at post-intervention and follow-up (adjusted R(2)\u2009=\u20090.41 and 0.40). At both evaluation points, SDQ change scores were significantly predicted by baseline SDQ score. Furthermore, symptom severity of the child with special needs was a significant predictor at three months post-intervention. Poorer emotional and behavioural functioning among participants and symptom severity of the child with special needs were associated with greater intervention effects.

Growing public concern and refusal to vaccinate poses a serious public health risk. Evaluations of recent pro-vaccine health communication interventions have revealed mixed results (at best). This study investigated whether highlighting consensus among medical scientists about childhood vaccine safety can lower public concern, reduce key misperceptions about the discredited autism-vaccine link and promote overall support for vaccines. American adults (N\u2009=\u2009206) were invited participate in an online survey experiment. Participants were randomly assigned to either a control group or to one of three treatment interventions. The treatment messages were based on expert-consensus estimates and either normatively described or prescribed the extant medical consensus: \"90\u00a0% of medical scientists agree that vaccines are safe and that all parents should be required to vaccinate their children\".

Mediation analysis further revealed that the public's understanding of the level of scientific agreement acts as an important \"gateway\" belief by promoting public attitudes and policy support for vaccines directly as well as indirectly by reducing endorsement of the discredited autism-vaccine link. These findings suggest that emphasizing the medical consensus about (childhood) vaccine safety is likely to be an effective pro-vaccine message that could help prevent current immunization rates from declining.

The aim of this study is to measure the effect of modified CBT, that is, using visualized language throughout the entire session for clients with ASD and anxiety and avoidance behavior. The modification of CBT in this study consists of focusing on CBT protocols for anxiety disorders and depression, while visualizing and systematizing \"the invisible\" in the conversation, in order for the clients to understand the social, cognitive and emotional context of self and others and how they should interact to avoid misunderstandings. ASD clients may need help to detect the invisible code of social interaction and communication. The level of anxiety and the frequency of target behavior were measured. Four assessments were made, two at the pre-assessment, and one in mid-therapy and end of therapy respectively. Generally, results suggest no improvement during pre-treatment period but a significant improvement during treatment. The values of the clients' psychological, social and occupational ability to function improved on the Global Function Rating scale.

The goal is to effectuate a behavioural modification by modulating brain activity. The EEG NF opens new therapeutic possibilities in the fields of psychiatry and neurology. However, the development of EEG NF in clinical practice requires (i) a good level of evidence of therapeutic efficacy of this technique, (ii) a good practice guide for this technique. Firstly, this article investigates selected trials with the following criteria: study design with controlled, randomized, and open or blind protocol, primary endpoint related to the mental and brain disorders treated and assessed with standardized measurement tools, identifiable EEG neurophysiological targets, underpinned by pathophysiological relevance. Trials were found for: epilepsies, migraine, stroke, chronic insomnia, attentional-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, addictive disorders, psychotic disorders. Secondly, this article investigates the principles of neurofeedback therapy in line with learning theory. Different underlying therapeutic models are presented didactically between two continua: a continuum between implicit and explicit learning and a continuum between the biomedical model (centred on \"the disease\") and integrative biopsychosocial model of health (centred on \"the illness\"). The main relevant learning model is to link neurofeedback therapy with the field of cognitive remediation techniques. The methodological specificity of neurofeedback is to be guided by biologically relevant neurophysiological parameters. Guidelines for good clinical practice of EEG NF concerning technical issues of electrophysiology and of learning are suggested.

This study tests the relationship between isolated core components of a packaged social communication intervention and the primary outcome, joint engagement, to better understand how the intervention is affecting change in individuals. A total of 86 toddlers and their parents were enrolled in the study and randomized to one of two treatments, the joint attention, symbolic play, engagement, and regulation (JASPER) parent-mediated intervention or a psychoeducational intervention. Measures regarding the parent's use of intervention strategies were collected before and after the 10-week intervention. Additional measures of child and parent joint engagement were also collected. A significant effect of treatment was found for all four of the core strategies of the intervention, favoring a larger increase in the JASPER condition. A hierarchical linear regression revealed several individual predictors of joint engagement, including parent-rated buy-in, interventionist-rated parent involvement, and parental use of strategies. To complement the hierarchical analysis, we also tested the potential mediating effect the strategies may have on the relationship between treatment and joint engagement. Results showed that the strategy of mirrored pacing mediated the relationship between treatment and joint engagement in the positive direction.

Interventions were categorized by type of approach (such as behavioral, developmental, naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention, and technology based), and outcomes were categorized by domain (such as social communication, adaptive behavior, play, and language). Risks of bias were evaluated following guidance from Cochrane. Effects were estimated for all intervention and outcome types with sufficient contributing data, stratified by risk of bias, using robust variance estimation to account for intercorrelation of effects within studies and subgroups.

Adverse events were poorly monitored, but possibly common. The available evidence on interventions to support young autistic children has approximately doubled in four years. Some evidence from randomized controlled trials shows that behavioral interventions improve caregiver perception of challenging behavior and child social emotional functioning, and that technology based interventions support proximal improvements in specific social communication and social emotional skills. Evidence also shows that developmental interventions improve social communication in interactions with caregivers, and naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions improve core challenges associated with autism, particularly difficulties with social communication.

However, no studies have examined the influence of neuro-enhancement by using excitatory high-frequency (20Hz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) on these networks. We used three forms of TMS stimulation (HF-rTMS, single and paired pulse) to investigate whether the mirror neuron system facilitates the motor system during goal-directed action observation relative to inanimate motion (motor resonance), a marker of putative mirror neuron activity. 31 healthy individuals were randomized to receive single-sessions of true or sham HF-rTMS delivered to the left inferior frontal gyrus - a component of the human mirror system. Motor resonance was assessed before and after HF-rTMS using three TMS cortical reactivity paradigms: (a) 120% of resting motor threshold (RMT), (b) stimulus intensity set to evoke motor evoked potential of 1-millivolt amplitude (SI1mV) and (c) a short latency paired pulse paradigm. Two-way RMANOVA showed a significant group (true versus sham) X occasion (pre- and post-HF-rTMS motor resonance) interaction effect for SI1mV [F(df)=6.26 (1, 29), p=0.018] and 120% RMT stimuli [F(df)=7.01 (1, 29), p=0.013] indicating greater enhancement of motor resonance in the true HF-rTMS group than the sham-group.

To evaluate the efficacy of parent training for children with autism spectrum disorder and disruptive behavior. This 24-week randomized trial compared parent training (n\u2009=\u200989) to parent education (n\u2009=\u200991) at 6 centers (Emory University, Indiana University, Ohio State University, University of Pittsburgh, University of Rochester, Yale University). We screened 267 children; 180 children (aged 3-7 years) with autism spectrum disorder and disruptive behaviors were randomly assigned (86% white, 88% male) between September 2010 and February 2014. Parent training (11 core, 2 optional sessions; 2 telephone boosters; 2 home visits) provided specific strategies to manage disruptive behavior. Parent education (12 core sessions, 1 home visit) provided information about autism but no behavior management strategies. Parents rated disruptive behavior and noncompliance on co-primary outcomes: the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability subscale (range, 0-45) and the Home Situations Questionnaire-Autism Spectrum Disorder (range, 0-9). On both measures, higher scores indicate greater severity and a 25% reduction indicates clinical improvement. A clinician blind to treatment assignment rated the Improvement scale of the Clinical Global Impression (range, 1-7), a secondary outcome, with a positive response less than 3. At week 24, the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability subscale declined 47.7% in parent training (from 23.7 to 12.4) compared with 31.8% for parent education (23.9 to 16.3) (treatment effect, -3.9; 95% CI, -6.2 to -1.7; P\u2009<\u2009.001, standardized effect size\u2009=\u20090.62).

Telehealth (i.e. videoconferencing) has potential to reduce barriers to access to care; however, little is known about the feasibility or efficacy of directly intervening with youth with autism spectrum disorders through this modality. This study details the pilot testing of a telehealth version of an empirically supported intervention targeting anxiety in youth with autism spectrum disorders. The primary focus of this study is on feasibility, with evaluation of outcomes as a starting point for future randomized trials. In all, 33 families of youth with autism spectrum disorders and significant anxiety symptoms participated in this study (Telehealth Facing Your Fears (FYF) Intervention: n = 17; Wait-list control: n = 16). Youth of all functioning levels were included. Acceptability was strong; however, the usability of the technology was problematic for some families and impeded some sessions significantly. Fidelity of the telehealth version to the critical elements of the original, in vivo version was excellent. More work is needed to improve delivery of exposure practices and parent coaching. Preliminary efficacy analyses are promising, with improvements observed in youth anxiety over time (relative to a comparison group waiting for live intervention) and parent sense of competence (within group).

Strikingly, the groups exhibited differential neural responses to treatment: The five children who exhibited hypoactivation at baseline evidenced increased activation in components of the reward system including the ventral striatum and putamen. The five children who exhibited hyperactivation at baseline evidenced decreased activation in subcortical regions critical for regulating the flow of stimulation and conveying signals of salience to the cortex-the thalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus.

The aim of this study was to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate PRT parent training group (PRTG) for targeting language deficits in young children with ASD. Fifty-three children with autism and significant language delay between 2 and 6\u00a0years old were randomized to PRTG (N\u00a0=\u00a027) or psychoeducation group (PEG; N\u00a0=\u00a026) for 12\u00a0weeks. The PRTG taught parents behavioral techniques to facilitate language development. The PEG taught general information about ASD (clinical trial NCT01881750; http://www.clinicaltrials.gov). Analysis of child utterances during the structured laboratory observation (primary outcome) indicated that, compared with children in the PEG, children in the PRTG demonstrated greater improvement in frequency of utterances (F(2, 43)\u00a0=\u00a03.53, p\u00a0=\u00a0.038, d\u00a0=\u00a00.42). Results indicated that parents were able to learn PRT in a group format, as the majority of parents in the PRTG (84%) met fidelity of implementation criteria after 12\u00a0weeks. Children also demonstrated greater improvement in adaptive communication skills (Vineland-II) following PRTG and baseline Mullen visual reception scores predicted treatment response to PRTG. This is the first randomized controlled trial of group-delivered PRT and one of the largest experimental investigations of the PRT model to date. The findings suggest that specific instruction in PRT results in greater skill acquisition for both parents and children, especially in functional and adaptive communication skills.

One eclectic intervention (autism programming; AP) was designed specifically for children with autism and was intensive in that it was delivered for an average of 25-30 h per week (n = 16). The other eclectic intervention (generic programming; GP) was delivered to 16 children with a variety of diagnoses and needs for an average of 15-17 h per week. This paper reports outcomes for children in all three groups after two additional years of intervention. With few exceptions, the benefits of IBT documented in our first study were sustained throughout Years 2 and 3. At their final assessment, children who received IBT were more than twice as likely to score in the normal range on measures of cognitive, language, and adaptive functioning than were children who received either form of eclectic intervention. Significantly more children in the IBT group than in the other two groups had IQ, language, and adaptive behavior test scores that increased by at least one standard deviation from intake to final assessment. Although the largest improvements for children in the IBT group generally occurred during Year 1, many children in that group whose scores were below the normal range after the first year of intervention attained scores in the normal range of functioning with one or two years of additional intervention. In contrast, children in the two eclectic treatment groups were unlikely to attain scores in the normal range after the first year of intervention, and many of those who had scores in the normal range in the first year fell out of the normal range in subsequent years. There were no consistent differences in outcomes at Years 2 and 3 between the two groups who received eclectic interventions. These results provide further evidence that intensive behavior analytic intervention delivered at an early age is more likely to produce substantial improvements in young children with autism than common eclectic interventions, even when the latter are intensive., keywords: Autistic Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Child, Child, Preschool, Combined Modality Therapy, Early Intervention, Educational, Humans, Longitudinal Studies, Treatment Outcome"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

Half were randomly assigned to PEGASUS, administered in six weekly group sessions, with the others receiving no additional intervention. ASD-related self-awareness, the primary outcome, was evaluated using the bespoke Autism Knowledge Quiz (AKQ). Secondary outcome measures included the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. All measures were collected during home visits and scored by researchers blind to group assignment. The trial is registered on ClinicalTrials (NCT01187940, http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) and was funded by the Baily Thomas Charitable Trust. Bootstrap multiple regression showed ASD knowledge (\u03b2 = .29, p < .001, 95% CIs [0.13, 0.44]) and ASD self-awareness (\u03b2 = .42, p = .001, 95% CIs [0.17, 0.67]), measured by number of ASD-related personal strengths and difficulties listed by participants, increased for those who attended PEGASUS (n = 24) compared with controls (n = 24). There was no effect of PEGASUS on self-esteem by self-report (\u03b2 = .10, p = .404, 95% CIs [-0.14, 0.35]) or parent report (\u03b2 = .12, p = .324, 95% CIs [-0.12, 0.36]). After PEGASUS, participants had more general knowledge about ASD, and showed a greater awareness of their collection of unique strengths and difficulties associated with ASD. Psychoeducation did not lower self-esteem. This RCT provides initial evidence for PEGASUS's efficacy as a psychoeducation programme for people with ASD., keywords: Adolescent, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Female, Humans, Male, Patient Education as Topic, Psychotherapy, Group, Self-Assessment, Treatment Outcome"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

The biological basis of this is unknown but may include differences in the modulatory role of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, which are implicated in the condition. However, this has never been tested directly. We therefore assessed the modifying role of serotonin on inhibitory brain function during a Go/No-Go task in 14 adults with autism and normal intelligence and 14 control subjects that did not differ in gender, age and intelligence. We undertook a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of acute tryptophan depletion using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Following sham, adults with autism relative to controls had reduced activation in key inhibitory regions of inferior frontal cortex and thalamus, but increased activation of caudate and cerebellum. However, brain activation was modulated in opposite ways by depletion in each group. Within autistic individuals depletion upregulated fronto-thalamic activations and downregulated striato-cerebellar activations toward control sham levels, completely 'normalizing' the fronto-cerebellar dysfunctions. The opposite pattern occurred in controls. Moreover, the severity of autism was related to the degree of differential modulation by depletion within frontal, striatal and thalamic regions. Our findings demonstrate that individuals with autism have abnormal inhibitory networks, and that serotonin has a differential, opposite, effect on them in adults with and without autism. Together these factors may partially explain the severity of autistic behaviours and/or provide a novel (tractable) treatment target., keywords: Adolescent, Adult, Autistic Disorder, Brain, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Neural Inhibition, Photic Stimulation, Reaction Time, Serotonin, Tryptophan, Young Adult"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

Mindfulness level is found to be an effective buffer between parents' appraisal of stress life events and psychological distress. However, the mechanism behind the function of mindfulness is unclear, and traditional mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) in experimental settings is not tailored to personal real-life needs. This study proposes to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the effectiveness of MBI delivered by ecological momentary intervention (EMI) and assessed by ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in changing participants' cognitive appraisal of stressful life events and thus reducing the psychological distress of parents of children with ASD. The proposed study will recruit 670 parents of children with ASD and randomly assign them to the intervention and control groups (335 in each group). Participants in the intervention group will install the EMI/A app on their smartphones. In the app, participants can receive practice prompts daily, browse and practice different mindfulness exercises in the intervention library at any time, talk to a virtual counselor (chatbot) when feeling stressed, complete EMA on the cognitive appraisal of life events, and receive the log of change of psychological status daily. Participants in the control group will only receive audio-based standardized mindfulness practice instructions three times per week. The effects of MBI will be assessed based on the EMA data, right after the intervention and at the 2-month follow-up. The primary outcome will be participants' psychological distress measured by the depression anxiety stress scale. The secondary outcomes will include participants' subjective well-being, measured by the satisfaction with life scale, and level of resilience, measured by the psychological empowerment scale. Multilevel structural equational modelling will be applied to examine the pathways of the relationship between daily life events, cognitive appraisal, and psychological distress. The potential benefit of the proposed study is to increase the psychological well-being of parents of children with ASD, and the method may extend to participants suffering from other psychological issues in the future.

To examine the effects of a music therapy group intervention on eye gaze, joint attention, and communication in children with ASD. Seventeen children, ages 6 to 9, with a diagnosis of ASD were randomly assigned to the music therapy group (MTG) or the no-music social skills group (SSG).

A total of 243 mothers of children with disabilities were consented and randomized into either Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (mindfulness practice) or Positive Adult Development (positive psychology practice). Well-trained, supervised peer mentors led 6 weeks of group treatments in 1.5-hour weekly sessions, assessing mothers 6 times before, during, and up to 6 months after treatment. Mothers had children with autism (65%) or other disabilities (35%). At baseline, 85% of this community sample had significantly elevated stress, 48% were clinically depressed, and 41% had anxiety disorders. Using slopes-as-outcomes, mixed random effects models, both treatments led to significant reductions in stress, depression, and anxiety, and improved sleep and life satisfaction, with large effects in depression and anxiety. Mothers in Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction versus Positive Adult Development had greater improvements in anxiety, depression, sleep, and well-being.

The therapy targeted parental behaviour, with no direct interaction between therapist and child. While nonsignificant group differences were found on ADOS-G score, significant group differences were found for both parent and child intermediate outcomes. This study aimed to better understand the mechanism by which the PACT treatment influenced changes in child behaviour though the targeted parent behaviour. Mediation analysis was used to assess the direct and indirect effects of treatment via parent behaviour on child behaviour and via child behaviour on ADOS-G score. Alternative mediation was explored to study whether the treatment effect acted as hypothesised or via another plausible pathway. Mediation models typically assume no unobserved confounding between mediator and outcome and no measurement error in the mediator. We show how to better exploit the information often available within a trial to begin to address these issues, examining scope for instrumental variable and measurement error models. Estimates of mediation changed substantially when account was taken of the confounder effects of the baseline value of the mediator and of measurement error. Our best estimates that accounted for both suggested that the treatment effect on the ADOS-G score was very substantially mediated by parent synchrony and child initiations. The results highlighted the value of repeated measurement of mediators during trials. The theoretical model underlying the PACT treatment was supported.

Specific fears and phobias can have a serious impact on young people with ASD and their families. In this study we developed and evaluated a unique treatment combining cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) with graduated exposure in a virtual reality environment (VRE). Nine verbally fluent boys with an ASD diagnosis and no reported learning disability, aged 7 to 13 years old, were recruited. Each had anxiety around a specific situation (e.g. crowded buses) or stimulus (e.g. pigeons). An individualised scene was recreated in our 'wrap-around' VRE. In the VRE participants were coached by a psychologist in cognitive and behavioural techniques (e.g. relaxation and breathing exercises) while the exposure to the phobia/fear stimulus was gradually increased as the child felt ready. Each child received four 20-30 minute sessions. After participating in the study, eight of the nine children were able to tackle their phobia situation. Four of the participants completely overcame their phobia. Treatment effects were maintained at 12 months. These results provide evidence that CBT with VRE can be a highly effective treatment for specific phobia/fear for some young people with ASD.

We included placebo-controlled clinical trials and cohort studies comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. We also included the following types of post-licensure analyses: case-control studies, self-controlled case series, and multivariate risk factor analyses. We conducted an electronic search of PubMed from inception through August 2013, and reviewed Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices statements, vaccine package inserts, and previously published reviews to identify studies. Scientific Information Packets were requested from vaccine manufacturers. We reviewed the methodology of the 2011 Institute of Medicine (IOM) consensus report \"Adverse Effects of Vaccines: Evidence and Causality\" and accepted their findings. We augmented their work with new studies and additional vaccines. For studies not included in the IOM report, we abstracted data on the presence or absence of adverse health outcomes, characteristics of patients, study design, and vaccine description, including brand, potency, dosage, timing, and formulation, where available. We excluded formulations not used in the United States. The McHarm instrument was used to evaluate the quality of adverse events collection and reporting in each study. We were unable to pool results; we rated the overall strength of evidence (SOE) as high, moderate, low, or insufficient by using guidance suggested by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality for its Effective Health Care Program. A total of 20,478 titles were identified; after title, abstract, and full-text review, 166 studies were accepted for abstraction. The vast majority of studies either did not investigate or could not identify risk factors for adverse events (AEs) associated with vaccination. Similarly, the severity of AEs was inconsistently reported, as was information that would make independent severity determination possible. SOE was high for the following associations in nonpregnant adults: seasonal influenza vaccine and arthralgia, myalgia, malaise, fever, pain at injection site; 2009 monovalent H1N1 vaccine and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS); and a lack of association between influenza and pneumococcal vaccines and cardiovascular events in the elderly. Risk of GBS was estimated at 1.6 excess cases per million persons vaccinated. SOE was high for the following associations in children and adolescents: measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and febrile seizures in children under age 5; lack of association between MMR vaccine and autism spectrum disorders; and varicella vaccine and disseminated Oka strain varicella zoster virus with associated complications (i.e., meningitis, encephalitis) in individuals with demonstrated immunodeficiencies. There is moderate SOE that vaccines against rotavirus are associated with intussusception in children; risk was estimated as 1 to 5 cases per 100,000 vaccine doses, depending on brand. Moderate-strength evidence exists regarding human papillomavirus vaccine and a lack of association with onset of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and GBS. Moderate-strength evidence shows no association between inactivated influenza vaccine and serious AEs in pregnant women. Evidence was insufficient to make conclusions regarding whether several routinely recommended vaccines are associated with serious conditions such as multiple sclerosis, transverse myelitis, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. There is evidence that some vaccines are associated with serious adverse events; however, these events are extremely rare and must be weighed against the protective benefits that vaccines provide. Careful consideration should be given to the investigation of research gaps, including patient risk factors that may be associated with AEs; however, important factors must be taken into account when determining whether studies are warranted, including the severity and frequency of the AE being studied and the challenges of conducting sufficiently powered studies when investigating rare events., keywords: Vaccines, Immunization, United States, Humans, Child, Adolescent, Young Adult, Adult"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

The primary outcome was the total number of spontaneous communicative utterances; secondary measures were the total number of novel words and total comments from a natural language sample. Primary aim results found improvements in spontaneous communicative utterances, novel words, and comments that all favored the blended behavioral intervention that began by including an SGD (JASP+EMT+SGD) as opposed to spoken words alone (JASP+EMT). Secondary aim results suggest that the adaptive intervention beginning with JASP+EMT+SGD and intensifying JASP+EMT+SGD for children who were slow responders led to better posttreatment outcomes.

Reduction in anxiety was partially maintained during the year following treatment; greater ASD severity predicted better treatment response. Our finding that brief treatment is associated with sustained gains is promising, given the pervasive and chronic nature of ASD.

Thirteen children with ASD (7-11 years old) were randomly assigned to 32 sessions of CBT or community-based psychosocial treatment (TAU) for 16 weeks. The CBT program is based on the memory retrieval competition model and emphasizes the development of perspective-taking through guided behavioral experimentation supplemented with reflective Socratic discussion and supported by parent training and school consultation to promote generalization of social communication and emotion regulation skills. Trained observers blind to treatment condition observed each child during recess on two separate days at baseline and again at posttreatment, using a structured behavioral observation system that generates frequency scores for observed social communication-related autism symptoms. CBT outperformed TAU at posttreatment on the frequency of self-isolation, the proportion of time spent with peers, the frequency of positive or appropriate interaction with peers, and the frequency of positive or appropriate peer responses to the target child (d effect size range 1.34-1.62). On average, children in CBT were engaged in positive or appropriate social interaction with peers in 68.6% of observed intervals at posttreatment, compared to 25% of intervals for children in TAU.

Parents were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 4 interventions: (1) information explaining the lack of evidence that MMR causes autism from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; (2) textual information about the dangers of the diseases prevented by MMR from the Vaccine Information Statement; (3) images of children who have diseases prevented by the MMR vaccine; (4) a dramatic narrative about an infant who almost died of measles from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention fact sheet; or to a control group. None of the interventions increased parental intent to vaccinate a future child. Refuting claims of an MMR/autism link successfully reduced misperceptions that vaccines cause autism but nonetheless decreased intent to vaccinate among parents who had the least favorable vaccine attitudes. In addition, images of sick children increased expressed belief in a vaccine/autism link and a dramatic narrative about an infant in danger increased self-reported belief in serious vaccine side effects.

A total of 50 adults with Asperger syndrome received the programme and were compared with a control group of typical development. The feasibility and effectiveness of the treatment were explored. Participants were assessed at pre-treatment and post-treatment on a task of social problem-solving skills and two secondary measures of socialisation and work profile using self- and caregiver-report. Using a variety of methods, the results showed that scores were significantly higher at post-treatment in the social problem-solving task and socialisation skills based on reports by parents.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe and efficacious technique when targeting specific areas of cortical dysfunction in major depressive disorder, and a similar approach could yield therapeutic benefits in ASD, if applied to relevant cortical regions. The aim of this study was to examine whether deep rTMS to bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex improves social relating in ASD. 28 adults diagnosed with either autistic disorder (high-functioning) or Asperger's disorder completed a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design with 2 weeks of daily weekday treatment. This involved deep rTMS to bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (5 Hz, 10-s train duration, 20-s inter-train interval) for 15 min (1500 pulses per session) using a HAUT-Coil. The sham rTMS coil was encased in the same helmet of the active deep rTMS coil, but no effective field was delivered into the brain.

While these skills are difficult to train, there is some evidence that active involvement in music-making provides unique opportunities for social interaction between participants. Family-centred music therapy (FCMT) endeavours to support social engagement between child and parent within active music-making, yet the extent of benefits provided is unknown. This study investigated the impacts of FCMT on social engagement abilities. Twenty-three children (36-60 months) with severe ASD received either 16 weeks of FCMT in addition to their early intervention programmes (n = 12), or their early intervention programme only (n = 11). Change in social engagement was measured with standardized parent-report assessments, parent interviews and clinician observation. Intention-to-treat analysis for the Vineland Social Emotional Early Childhood Scale indicated a significant effect in favour of FCMT. Thematic qualitative analysis of the parent interviews showed that the parent-child relationship grew stronger.

To investigate whether a brief cognitive behavioral intervention, problem-solving education (PSE), decreases parenting stress and maternal depressive symptoms during the period immediately following a child's diagnosis of ASD. A randomized clinical trial compared 6 sessions of PSE with usual care. Settings included an autism clinic and 6 community-based early intervention programs that primarily serve low-income families. Participants were mothers of 122 young children (mean age, 34 months) who recently received a diagnosis of ASD. Among mothers assessed for eligibility, 17.0% declined participation. We report outcomes after 3 months of follow-up (immediate postdiagnosis period). Problem-solving education is a brief, cognitive intervention delivered in six 30-minute individualized sessions by existing staff (early intervention programs) or research staff without formal mental health training (autism clinic). Primary outcomes were parental stress and maternal depressive symptoms. Fifty-nine mothers were randomized to receive PSE and 63 to receive usual care. The follow-up rate was 91.0%. Most intervention mothers (78.0%) received the full PSE course. At the 3-month follow-up assessment, PSE mothers were significantly less likely than those serving as controls to have clinically significant parental stress (3.8% vs 29.3%; adjusted relative risk [aRR], 0.17; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.65).

A total of 10 families participated in the treatment condition, and the program was evaluated using a waitlist control design (n = 9), representing the first randomized-control study of a feeding intervention in autism spectrum disorders. Results provide provisional support regarding the utility of the program, including high social validity, parent perception of effectiveness, and reduced levels of caregiver stress following intervention. Implications, limitations, and future directions for this line of research are discussed., keywords: Autistic Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Child, Preschool, Curriculum, Education, Nonprofessional, Feeding Behavior, Feeding and Eating Disorders of Childhood, Female, Humans, Male, Parenting, Parents"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

In this paper, we summarize the results of this Italian-Israeli consensus conference. ASDs constitute a class of severe and heterogeneous neurodevelopmental conditions caused by atypical brain development beginning during early prenatal life, reflecting many genetic, neurobiological and environmental influences. The first clinical signs of ASDs begin to be evident in children between 12 and 18 months of age, often after a period of relatively typical postnatal development. Recent longitudinal studies reveal substantial diversity in developmental trajectories through childhood and adolescence. Some intervention approaches have been demonstrated to be effective in improving core symptoms of ASDs, even if the heterogeneity and developmental nature of the disorder make it implausible that only one specific treatment will be best for all children with ASDs. More randomized control trials (RCTs) on early intervention are needed to identify the most effective strategies and provide the most efficient allocation of resources during the critical early intervention time period. Future research should focus on linking biological phenotypes with specific genotypes, thus establishing a foundation for the development of diagnostic screening tools and individualization of treatments., keywords: Adolescent, Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Early Diagnosis, Female, Humans, Israel, Italy, Male"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

Both interventions comprised 36 weekly 3-h sessions led by two therapists in groups of 6-8 patients. A total of 68 psychiatric patients with autism spectrum disorders participated in the study. Outcome measures were Quality of Life Inventory, Sense of Coherence Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and an exploratory analysis on measures of psychiatric health. Participants in both treatment conditions reported an increased quality of life at post-treatment (d = 0.39, p < 0.001), with no difference between interventions. No amelioration of psychiatric symptoms was observed. The dropout rate was lower with cognitive behavioural therapy than with recreational activity, and participants in cognitive behavioural therapy rated themselves as more generally improved, as well as more improved regarding expression of needs and understanding of difficulties. Both interventions appear to be promising treatment options for adults with autism spectrum disorder. The interventions' similar efficacy may be due to the common elements, structure and group setting.

We examined whether a combination of the Awareness and Care for My Autistic Traits (ACAT) program and treatment-as-usual is more effective than only treatment-as-usual in increasing the understanding of autistic attributes, reducing treatment stigma, and improving mental health and social adaptation among autistic adolescents and their parents/guardians. Forty-nine adolescents and their parents/guardians were randomly assigned to either a combination of ACAT and treatment-as-usual or only treatment-as-usual. The combined group received six weekly 100-minute ACAT sessions, while the treatment-as-usual group received no additional intervention. The primary outcome was the change in understanding of autistic attributes (Autism Knowledge Quiz-Child), administered from pre- to post-intervention. The secondary outcomes included the change in Autism Knowledge Quiz-Parent, reduced treatment stigma, and improved mental health and social adaptation among autistic adolescents and their parents/guardians. A primary outcome measure scale was scored by assessors who were blind to the group assignment. The combined group (both autistic adolescents and their parents/guardians) showed an increase in Autism Knowledge Quiz scores compared to those in the treatment-as-usual group. Autistic adolescents in the combined group also demonstrated a decrease in treatment-related stigma and an improvement in general mental health compared to those in the treatment-as-usual group, while there were no group differences in the change in social adaptation. For parents/guardians, there were no group differences in the change in treatment-related stigma, general mental health, adaptive skills, or attitudes toward their children. The ACAT program could be an effective treatment modality to increase the understanding of autistic attributes among both autistic adolescents and their parents/guardians. The ACAT program positively affects self-understanding, reduces treatment stigma, and stabilizes behavioral issues for autistic adolescents as a part of mental health measures, but it does not effectively reduce treatment barriers or improve mental health for parents/guardians. Further research should consider whether additional support for parents/guardians could be beneficial.

Biologic hypotheses suggest that an overly rapid brain growth leads to the core symptoms of ASD by impairing connectivity. Literature is divided however where deleterious, protective and null associations of HC with ASD symptoms in individuals with ASD have been found. Individuals (n\u200a=\u200a1,416) from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange with ASD were examined for associations of HC with ASD like symptoms. Mixed models controlling for sex, age, race/ethnicity, simplex/multiplex status and accounting for correlations between siblings were used. Interactions by simplex/multiplex were explored. Adjustments for height in a sub-population with available data were explored as well. A Significant interaction term (p\u200a=\u200a0.03) suggested that the effect of HC was dependent on whether the individual was simplex or multiplex. In simplex individuals at mean age (8.9 years) 1 cm increase in head circumference was associated with a 24% increase in the odds of a high social diagnostic score from the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (odds ratio \u200a=\u200a1.24, p\u200a=\u200a0.01). There was no association in multiplex individuals. Additionally, individuals classified with a non-verbal IQ <70 were 90% simplex and had a significantly increased head circumference (0.7 cm p\u200a=\u200a0.03) relative to a mid-range non-verbal IQ group. Interestingly, children classified with a >110 non-verbal IQ also had an increased HC (0.4 cm p\u200a=\u200a0.04), relative to a mid-range non-verbal IQ group, and were 90% multiplex. HC effects do not appear to be confounded by height, however, larger samples with height information are needed.

Recent research also suggests that adults with ASD are unable to understand their own mental states, which could lead to difficulties in emotion-regulation. Some studies have reported the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in improving emotion-regulation among children with ASD. The current study will investigate the efficacy of group-based CBT for adults with ASD. The study is a randomized, waitlist controlled, single-blinded trial. The participants will be 60 adults with ASD; 30 will be assigned to a CBT group and 30 to a waitlist control group. Primary outcome measures are the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale, the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations, the Motion Picture Mind-Reading task, and an ASD questionnaire. The secondary outcome measures are the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale 26-item version, the Global Assessment of Functioning, State-trait Anxiety Inventory, Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory, and Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. All will be administered during the pre- and post-intervention, and 12 week follow-up periods. The CBT group will receive group therapy over an 8 week period (one session per week) with each session lasting approximately 100 minutes. Group therapy will consist of four or five adults with ASD and two psychologists. We will be using visual materials for this program, mainly the Cognitive Affective Training kit.

Social skills groups are a common intervention for individuals with ASD. Although a frequently recommended practice, the few studies that have addressed the efficacy of social skills groups have shown mixed results. To determine the effectiveness of social skills groups for improving social competence, social communication, and quality of life for people with ASD who are six to 21 years of age. We searched the following databases in December 2011: CENTRAL (2011 Issue 4), MEDLINE (1948 to November Week 3, 2011), EMBASE (1980 to Week 50, 2011), PsycINFO (1887 to December Week 2, 2011), CINAHL (1937 to current), ERIC (1966 to current), Sociological Abstracts (1952 to current), OCLC WorldCat (12 December 2011), Social Science Citation Index (1970 to 16 December 2011), and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (20 December 2011). We also searched the reference lists of published papers. Randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing treatment (social skills groups) with a control group who were not receiving the treatment for participants aged six to 21 years with ASD. The control group could be no intervention, wait list, or treatment as usual. Outcomes sought were standardized measures of social competence, social communication, quality of life, emotion recognition, and any other specific behaviors. Two review authors independently selected and appraised studies for inclusion and assessed the risk of bias in each included study. All outcome data were continuous and standardized mean difference effect sizes (ES) with small sample correction were calculated. We conducted random-effects meta-analysis where possible. We included five RCTs evaluating the effects of social skills groups in 196 participants with ASD aged 6 to 21 years old. The results show there is some evidence that social skills groups improve overall social competence (ES = 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.78, P = 0.003) and friendship quality (ES = 0.41, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.81, P = 0.04) for this population. No differences were found between treatment and control groups in relation to emotional recognition (ES = 0.34, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.88, P = 0.21) assessed in two studies or social communication as related to the understanding of idioms (ES = 0.05, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.72, P = 0.89), which was assessed in only one study. Two additional quality of life outcomes were evaluated, with results of single studies suggesting decreases in loneliness (ES = -0.66, 95% CI -1.15 to -0.17) but no effect on child or parental depression. No adverse events were reported. Given the nature of the intervention and the selected outcome measures, the risk of performance and detection bias are high. There is limited generalizability from the studies as they were all conducted in the US; they focused mainly on children aged 7 to 12, and the participants were all of average or above average intelligence. There is some evidence that social skills groups can improve social competence for some children and adolescents with ASD.

The present study aims to compare the effect of a traditional Chinese Chan-based mind-body exercise, Nei Yang Gong, with that of the conventional Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) technique in enhancing the self-control of children with ASD. Forty-six age- and IQ-matched ASD children were randomly assigned to receive group training in Nei Yang Gong (experimental group) or PMR (control group) twice per week for four weeks. The participants' self-control was measured by three neuropsychological tests and parental rating on standardized questionnaires, and the underlying neural mechanism was assessed by the participants' brain EEG activity during an inhibitory-control task before and after intervention. The results show that the experimental group demonstrated significantly greater improvement in self-control than the control group, which concurs with the parental reports of reduced autistic symptoms and increased control of temper and behaviors. In addition, the experimental group showed enhanced EEG activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, a region that mediates self-control, whereas the PMR group did not.

Digital health interventions can reduce treatment costs and promote healthy lifestyle changes. These therapies can be adjunctive or replace traditional treatments. However, issues with cooperation and compliance prevent preschool patients with ASD from applying these tools. In this open-label, randomized controlled trial, we developed a nonwearable digital therapy called virtual reality-incorporated cognitive behavioral therapy (VR-CBT). The aim of this study was to assess the adjunctive function of VR-CBT by comparing the effects of VR-CBT plus learning style profile (LSP) intervention with those of LSP-only intervention in preschool children with ASD. This trial was performed in China on 78 preschool children (age 3-6 years, IQ>70) diagnosed with ASD who were randomized to receive a 20-week VR-CBT plus LSP intervention (intervention group, 39/78, 50%) or LSP intervention only (control group, 39/78, 50%). The primary outcome was the change of scores from baseline to week 20, assessed by using the parent-rated Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC). Secondary outcomes included the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS-IV), and behavioral performance data (accuracy and reaction time) in go/no-go tasks. All primary and secondary outcomes were analyzed in the intention-to-treat population. After the intervention, there was an intervention effect on total ABC (\u03b2=-5.528; P<.001) and CARS scores (\u03b2=-1.365; P=.02). A similar trend was observed in the ABC subscales: sensory (\u03b2=-1.133; P=.047), relating (\u03b2=-1.512; P=.03), body and object use (\u03b2=-1.211; P=.03), and social and self-help (\u03b2=-1.593; P=.03). The intervention also showed statistically significant effects in improving behavioral performance (go/no-go task, accuracy, \u03b2=2.923; P=.04). Moreover, a significant improvement of ADHD hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms was observed in 53 children with comorbid ADHD based on ADHD-RS-IV (\u03b2=-1.269; P=.02). No statistically significant intervention effect was detected in the language subscale of ABC (\u03b2=-.080; P=.83). Intervention group girls had larger improvements in ABC subscales, that is, sensory and body and object use and in the CARS score and accuracy of go/no-go task (all P<.05) than the control group girls. Statistically significant intervention effects could be observed in hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms in the intervention group boys with comorbid ADHD compared with those in the control group boys (\u03b2=-1.333; P=.03). We found potentially positive effects of nonwearable digital therapy plus LSP on core symptoms associated with ASD, leading to a modest improvement in the function of sensory, motor, and response inhibition, while reducing impulsivity and hyperactivity in preschoolers with both ASD and ADHD.

Children with DD are also at high risk for exhibiting significant behaviour problems. Parental stress has been shown to impact the development of these behaviour problems; however, it is rarely addressed in interventions aimed at reducing child behaviour problems. The current study examined the efficacy of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) for parents of children with DD by investigating whether this intervention is effective in reducing parenting stress and whether decreases in parenting stress lead to reductions in behaviour problems among children with DD. Forty six parents of children with DD were randomly assigned to an immediate treatment or wait list-control group. Participants completed questionnaires assessing parental stress and child behaviour problems at intake and at a second assessment, which took place after only the immediate treatment group had received the MBSR. Parents who participated in MBSR reported significantly less stress and depression as well as greater life satisfaction compared with wait list-control parents. Regarding child outcomes, children whose parents participated in MBSR were reported to have fewer behaviour problems following the intervention, specifically in the areas of attention problems and ADHD symptomatology. Results indicated that MBSR may be an effective intervention for ameliorating parental stress and mental health problems among parents of children with DD.

It is classified as a type of pervasive developmental disorder (PDD). All PDDs have a qualitative impairment in social relatedness. However, many individuals with PDDs have interfering symptoms, including irritability (aggression, self-injurious behavior, and severe tantrums). Behavioral therapy is often helpful in decreasing these behaviors; however, sometimes adjunctive medications are needed, because of the intensity and severity of irritability. Numerous medications have been tested on patients with PDDs. Although many of these medications have been demonstrated to be useful, no clear main treatment for PDD has emerged. Despite the efficacy of some of the medicines, acceptability and side effects have proven to be barriers to their use. Yokukansan (TJ-54), a traditional Japanese medicine, is composed of seven kinds of dried herbs. It is widely prescribed in clinical situations for treating psychiatric disorders by acting mainly on the glutamatergic and serotonergic nervous system. Recent studies indicate that TJ-54 may be safe and useful in treating behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia patients. We aimed at evaluating both the efficacy and the safety of TJ-54 in patients with PDDs. This was a 12 week prospective, open-label investigation of TJ-54 in 20 children and adolescents ages 6-17 years diagnosed with PDDs. Primary outcome measures included the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement of Illness Scale (CGI-I), Children's Global Assessment Score (CGAS), and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) irritability subscale. Twenty subjects, ages 6-17 years, received TJ-54 in the dosage range of 2.5-7.5\u2009g/day. The CGI-I was significantly improved from 8 weeks (p<0.001). The mean CGAS was 31.92 at baseline, whereas the mean final score at 12 weeks was 54.52 (p<0.001). The ABC irritability/agitation subscale (subscale 1) was significantly improved from 8 weeks, and the hyperactivity/noncompliance subscale (subscale 4) was significantly improved in 12 weeks. TJ-54 was well tolerated. No subject left the study because of a drug-related adverse event. These preliminary data suggest that TJ-54 may be effective and well tolerated for the treatment of severe irritability/agitation and hyperactivity/noncompliance in children and adolescents ages 6-17 years with PDD.

Causes of these problems are multifaceted, but culminate in difficulties with interacting in daily life social situations. Current treatments have only moderate effects on social functioning and often target one specific domain. Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to improve the treatment of social interaction difficulties. We developed a modular VR treatment for social functioning and participation (VR-SOAP). In this study, the effect of this intervention will be investigated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). A total of 116 participants (age 18-40) with a DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorder and problems with social functioning will be recruited from mental healthcare institutes in the Netherlands. Participants will be randomized to the experimental condition (VR-SOAP) or active VR control condition (VRelax). VR-SOAP consists of 14 sessions and 5 modules addressing causes of impaired social functioning: four optional modules (1-4) and one fixed module (5). Vrelax consists of 14 sessions that entail psychoeducation, stress management, relaxation techniques, and the exploration of relaxing environments in VR. Primary outcomes are quantity and quality of social contacts, leisure activities and social participation, measured with the experience sampling method (ESM). Secondary outcomes are psychiatric symptoms, social behaviour, social cognition, self-esteem, self-stigma and paranoid thoughts. Treatment effects will be compared at pre-treatment (baseline), post-treatment and at 6-month follow-up. If VR-SOAP proves to be effective, it provides therapists with a much-needed tool to improve social functioning of young adults with a psychotic disorder.

The primary outcome was defined as an improvement of 2 points in error rates for facial emotion labeling (DANVA2) from baseline. After the 6-month training period, the SST Group made fewer errors in labeling anger on adult faces, whereas error rates in the LA Group remained stable. Progress in the ability to recognize anger in the SST Group was due to better recognition of low intensity stimuli on adult faces. QoL increased in the SST Group in the dimension of school environment, as a marker of the transfer of skills acquired in the treatment setting to their use in the community.

Although many of these medications have been demonstrated to be useful, no clear primary treatment for PDD-NOS and Asperger's disorder has emerged. Despite the efficacy of some of the medicines, the acceptability and side effects have proven to be barriers to their use. Recent studies indicate that the traditional Japanese herbal medicine yokukansan (TJ-54) may be safe and useful in treating behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia and some neuropsychiatric disorders. We aimed at evaluating both the efficacy and safety of TJ-54 in patients with well-defined PDD-NOS and Asperger's disorder. This was a 12-week prospective, open-label investigation of TJ-54 in 40 children, adolescents, and adults diagnosed with PDD-NOS or Asperger's disorder.

At present, there are no curative or psychopharmacological therapies to effectively treat all symptoms of the disorder. Early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI), a treatment based on the principles of applied behavior analysis delivered for multiple years at an intensity of 20 to 40 hours per week, is one of the more well-established treatments for ASD. To systematically review the evidence for the effectiveness of EIBI in increasing the functional behaviors and skills of young children with ASD. We searched the following databases on 22 November 2011: CENTRAL (2011 Issue 4), MEDLINE (1948 to November Week 2, 2011), EMBASE (1980 to Week 46, 2011), PsycINFO (1806 to November Week 3, 2011), CINAHL (1937 to current), ERIC (1966 to current), Sociological Abstracts (1952 to current), Social Science Citation Index (1970 to current), WorldCat, metaRegister of Controlled Trials, and Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations. We also searched the reference lists of published papers. Randomized control trials (RCTs), quasi-randomized control trials, or clinical control trials (CCTs) in which EIBI was compared to a no-treatment or treatment-as-usual control condition. Participants must have been less than six years of age at treatment onset and assigned to their study condition prior to commencing treatment. Two authors independently selected and appraised studies for inclusion and assessed the risk of bias in each included study. All outcome data were continuous, from which standardized mean difference effect sizes with small sample correction were calculated. We conducted random-effects meta-analysis where possible, which means we assumed individual studies would provide different estimates of treatment effects. One RCT and four CCTs with a total of 203 participants were included. Reliance on synthesis from four CCTs limits the evidential base and this should be borne in mind when interpreting the results. All studies used a treatment-as-usual comparison group. We synthesized the results of the four CCTs using a random-effects model of meta-analysis of the standardized mean differences. Positive effects in favor of the EIBI treatment group were found for all outcomes. The mean effect size for adaptive behavior was g = 0.69 (95% CI 0.38 to 1.01; P < 0.0001). The mean effect size for IQ was g = 0.76 (95% CI 0.40 to 1.11; P < 0.0001). Three measures of communication and language skills all showed results in favor of EIBI: expressive language g = 0.50 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.95; P = 0.03), receptive language g = 0.57 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.94; P = .03), and daily communication skills g = 0.74 (95% CI 0.30 to 1.18; P = 0.0009). The mean effect size for socialization was g = 0.42 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.73; P = 0.0008), and for daily living skills was g = 0.55 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.87; P = 0.0005). Additional descriptive analyses of other aspects related to quality of life and psychopathology are presented. However, due to the inclusion of non-randomized studies, there is a high risk of bias and the overall quality of evidence was rated as 'low' using the GRADE system, which rates the quality of evidence from meta-analyses to determine recommendations for practice. There is some evidence that EIBI is an effective behavioral treatment for some children with ASD. However, the current state of the evidence is limited because of the reliance on data from non-randomized studies (CCTs) due to the lack of RCTs. Additional studies using RCT research designs are needed to make stronger conclusions about the effects of EIBI for children with ASD., keywords: Behavior Therapy, Child, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive, Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic, Early Intervention, Educational, Early Medical Intervention, Humans"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

We randomly assigned adults with ASD to MBSR or social support/education (SE). They completed questionnaires that assessed depression, anxiety, mindfulness traits, autistic traits and executive functioning abilities as well as a self-reflection functional MRI task. We used repeated-measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to evaluate behavioural changes. To identify task-specific connectivity changes, we performed a generalized psychophysiological interactions (gPPI) functional connectivity (FC) analysis on regions of interest (ROIs; insula, amygdala, cingulum and prefrontal cortex [PFC]). We used Pearson correlations to explore brain-behaviour relationships. Our final sample included 78 adults with ASD - 39 who received MBSR and 39 who received SE. Mindfulness-based stress reduction uniquely improved executive functioning abilities and increased mindfulness traits, whereas both MBSR and SE groups showed reductions in depression, anxiety and autistic traits. Decreases specific to MBSR in insula-thalamus FC were associated with anxiety reduction and increased mindfulness traits, including the trait \"nonjudgment;\" MBSR-specific decreases in PFC-posterior cingulate connectivity correlated with improved working memory. Both groups showed decreased amygdala-sensorimotor and medial-lateral PFC connectivity, which corresponded with reduced depression. Larger sample sizes and neuropsychological evaluations are needed to replicate and extend these findings. Together, our findings suggest that MBSR and SE are similarly efficacious for depression, anxiety and autistic traits, whereas MBSR produced additional salutary effects related to executive functioning and mindfulness traits. Findings from gPPI identified shared and distinct therapeutic neural mechanisms, implicating the default mode and salience networks.

To overcome these methodological shortcomings, this study evaluated the effects of EEG-biofeedback in ASD in a randomized pretest-posttest control group design with blinded active comparator and six months follow-up. Thirty-eight participants were randomly allocated to the EEG-biofeedback, skin conductance (SC)-biofeedback or waiting list group.

Fifty-four percent of the participants significantly reduced delta and/or theta power during EEG-biofeedback sessions and were identified as EEG-regulators. In these EEG-regulators, no statistically significant reductions of symptoms of ASD were observed, but they showed significant improvement in cognitive flexibility as compared to participants who managed to regulate SC.

Social skills groups are a common intervention for individuals with ASD. Although a frequently recommended practice, the few studies that have addressed the efficacy of social skills groups have shown mixed results. To determine the effectiveness of social skills groups for improving social competence, social communication, and quality of life for people with ASD who are six to 21 years of age. We searched the following databases in December 2011: CENTRAL (2011 Issue 4), MEDLINE (1948 to November Week 3, 2011), EMBASE (1980 to Week 50, 2011), PsycINFO (1887 to December Week 2, 2011), CINAHL (1937 to current), ERIC (1966 to current), Sociological Abstracts (1952 to current), OCLC WorldCat (12 December 2011), Social Science Citation Index (1970 to 16 December 2011), and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (20 December 2011). We also searched the reference lists of published papers. Randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing treatment (social skills groups) with a control group who were not receiving the treatment for participants aged six to 21 years with ASD. The control group could be no intervention, wait list, or treatment as usual. Outcomes sought were standardized measures of social competence, social communication, quality of life, emotion recognition, and any other specific behaviors. Two review authors independently selected and appraised studies for inclusion and assessed the risk of bias in each included study. All outcome data were continuous and standardized mean difference effect sizes (ES) with small sample correction were calculated. We conducted random-effects meta-analysis where possible. We included five RCTs evaluating the effects of social skills groups in 196 participants with ASD aged 6 to 21 years old. The results show there is some evidence that social skills groups improve overall social competence (ES = 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.78, P = 0.003) and friendship quality (ES = 0.41, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.81, P = 0.04) for this population. No differences were found between treatment and control groups in relation to emotional recognition (ES = 0.34, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.88, P = 0.21) assessed in two studies or social communication as related to the understanding of idioms (ES = 0.05, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.72, P = 0.89), which was assessed in only one study. Two additional quality of life outcomes were evaluated, with results of single studies suggesting decreases in loneliness (ES = -0.66, 95% CI -1.15 to -0.17) but no effect on child or parental depression. No adverse events were reported.Given the nature of the intervention and the selected outcome measures, the risk of performance and detection bias are high. There is limited generalizability from the studies as they were all conducted in the US; they focused mainly on children aged 7 to 12, and the participants were all of average or above average intelligence.

The authors used an ABACAD design to compare the effects of a developmental social-pragmatic, naturalistic behavioral, and combined intervention on language type and function and social engagement in 5 children with autism. Milieu teaching and the combined intervention produced higher rates of language targets than did responsive interaction. An analysis of the type and function of language targets suggested that differences between conditions were driven primarily by prompted-and, to a lesser extent, spontaneous-requests. Social engagement ratings were higher during each intervention than at baseline, but differences between treatment conditions were not consistent across children. For children with autism, naturalistic interventions that use direct elicitation of child language lead to greater short-term gains in the use of expressive language targets-in particular, prompted requests-than interventions that use facilitative strategies only. All 3 naturalistic language interventions can promote social engagement.

However, public debate over the safety of the trivalent MMR vaccine and the resultant drop in vaccination coverage in several countries persists, despite its almost universal use and accepted effectiveness. To assess the effectiveness and adverse effects associated with the MMR vaccine in children up to 15 years of age. For this update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, PubMed (July 2004 to May week 2, 2011) and Embase.com (July 2004 to May 2011). We used comparative prospective or retrospective trials assessing the effects of the MMR vaccine compared to placebo, do nothing or a combination of measles, mumps and rubella antigens on healthy individuals up to 15 years of age. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality of the included studies. One review author arbitrated in case of disagreement. We included five randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one controlled clinical trial (CCT), 27 cohort studies, 17 case-control studies, five time-series trials, one case cross-over trial, two ecological studies, six self controlled case series studies involving in all about 14,700,000 children and assessing effectiveness and safety of MMR vaccine. Based on the available evidence, one MMR vaccine dose is at least 95% effective in preventing clinical measles and 92% effective in preventing secondary cases among household contacts.Effectiveness of at least one dose of MMR in preventing clinical mumps in children is estimated to be between 69% and 81% for the vaccine prepared with Jeryl Lynn mumps strain and between 70% and 75% for the vaccine containing the Urabe strain. Vaccination with MMR containing the Urabe strain has demonstrated to be 73% effective in preventing secondary mumps cases. Effectiveness of Jeryl Lynn containing MMR in preventing laboratory-confirmed mumps cases in children and adolescents was estimated to be between 64% to 66% for one dose and 83% to 88% for two vaccine doses. We did not identify any studies assessing the effectiveness of MMR in preventing rubella.The highest risk of association with aseptic meningitis was observed within the third week after immunisation with Urabe-containing MMR (risk ratio (RR) 14.28; 95% confidence interval (CI) from 7.93 to 25.71) and within the third (RR 22.5; 95% CI 11.8 to 42.9) or fifth (RR 15.6; 95% CI 10.3 to 24.2) weeks after immunisation with the vaccine prepared with the Leningrad-Zagreb strain. A significant risk of association with febrile seizures and MMR exposure during the two previous weeks (RR 1.10; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.15) was assessed in one large person-time cohort study involving 537,171 children aged between three months and five year of age. Increased risk of febrile seizure has also been observed in children aged between 12 to 23 months (relative incidence (RI) 4.09; 95% CI 3.1 to 5.33) and children aged 12 to 35 months (RI 5.68; 95% CI 2.31 to 13.97) within six to 11 days after exposure to MMR vaccine. An increased risk of thrombocytopenic purpura within six weeks after MMR immunisation in children aged 12 to 23 months was assessed in one case-control study (RR 6.3; 95% CI 1.3 to 30.1) and in one small self controlled case series (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 5.38; 95% CI 2.72 to 10.62). Increased risk of thrombocytopenic purpura within six weeks after MMR exposure was also assessed in one other case-control study involving 2311 children and adolescents between one month and 18 years (odds ratio (OR) 2.4; 95% CI 1.2 to 4.7). Exposure to the MMR vaccine was unlikely to be associated with autism, asthma, leukaemia, hay fever, type 1 diabetes, gait disturbance, Crohn's disease, demyelinating diseases, bacterial or viral infections.

Several reports indicate that children with ASD show reduced error processing and deficient behavioral correction after an error is committed. Error sensitivity can be readily examined by measuring event-related potentials (ERP) associated with responses to errors, the fronto-central error-related negativity (ERN), and the error-related positivity (Pe). The goal of our study was to investigate whether reaction time (RT), error rate, post-error RT change, ERN, and Pe will show positive changes following 12-week long slow frequency repetitive TMS (rTMS) over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in high functioning children with ASD. We hypothesized that 12 sessions of 1 Hz rTMS bilaterally applied over the DLPFC will result in improvements reflected in both behavioral and ERP measures. Participants were randomly assigned to either active rTMS treatment or wait-list (WTL) groups. Baseline and post-TMS/or WTL EEG was collected using 128 channel EEG system. The task involved the recognition of a specific illusory shape, in this case a square or triangle, created by three or four inducer disks. ERN in TMS treatment group became significantly more negative. The number of omission errors decreased post-TMS. The RT did not change, but post-error RT became slower. There were no changes in RT, error rate, post-error RT slowing, nor in ERN/Pe measures in the wait-list group. Our results show significant post-TMS differences in the response-locked ERP such as ERN, as well as behavioral response monitoring measures indicative of improved error monitoring and correction function.

Noncompliance to blood draws can have significant ramifications in both research and clinical settings. The negative reactions may be exacerbated in individuals with autism spectrum disorders. Even so, there has been little research into the prevalence of the problem or effective intervention procedures. In response to these concerns, we developed and evaluated the Blood Draw Intervention Program.

In a quasi-randomized trial over the course of \u223c 18 months, 58 of 210 families with children with autism spectrum disorders participating in a larger study of phenotypic and genotypic factors reported significant concerns about blood draws and elected to use the Blood Draw Intervention Program.

Fifty toddlers with ASD, ages 21 to 33 months, were randomized to one of two six-month interventions: Interpersonal Synchrony or Non-Interpersonal Synchrony. The interventions provided identical intensity (10 hours per week in classroom), student-to-teacher ratio, schedule, home-based parent training (1.5 hours per month), parent education (38 hours), and instructional strategies, except the Interpersonal Synchrony condition provided a supplementary curriculum targeting socially engaged imitation, joint attention, and affect sharing; measures of these were primary outcomes. Assessments were conducted pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, and, to assess maintenance, at six-month follow-up. Random effects models were used to examine differences between groups over time. Secondary analyses examined gains in expressive language and nonverbal cognition, and time effects during the intervention and follow-up periods. A significant treatment effect was found for socially engaged imitation (p = .02), with more than doubling (17% to 42%) of imitated acts paired with eye contact in the Interpersonal Synchrony group after the intervention. This skill was generalized to unfamiliar contexts and maintained through follow-up. Similar gains were observed for initiation of joint attention and shared positive affect, but between-group differences did not reach statistical significance. A significant time effect was found for all outcomes (p < .001); greatest change occurred during the intervention period, particularly in the Interpersonal Synchrony group.

Electrophysiological research has provided evidence that gamma band activity (30-80 Hz) is a physiological indicator of the co-activation of cortical cells engaged in processing visual stimuli and integrating different features of a stimulus. A number of studies have found augmented and indiscriminative gamma band power at early stages of visual processing in ASD; this may be related to decreased inhibitory processing and an increase in the ratio of cortical excitation to inhibition. Low frequency or 'slow' (\u22641HZ) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been shown to increase inhibition of stimulated cortex by the activation of inhibitory circuits. METHODS: We wanted to test the hypothesis of gamma band abnormalities at early stages of visual processing in ASD by investigating relative evoked (i.e. ~ 100 ms) gamma power in 25 subjects with ASD and 20 age-matched controls using Kanizsa illusory figures. Additionally, we wanted to assess the effects of 12 sessions of bilateral 'slow' rTMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on evoked gamma activity using a randomized controlled design. RESULTS: In individuals with ASD evoked gamma activity was not discriminative of stimulus type, whereas in controls early gamma power differences between target and non-target stimuli were highly significant. Following rTMS individuals with ASD showed significant improvement in discriminatory gamma activity between relevant and irrelevant visual stimuli. We also found significant improvement in the responses on behavioral questionnaires (i.e., irritability, repetitive behavior) as a result of rTMS. CONCLUSION: We proposed that 'slow' rTMS may have increased cortical inhibitory tone which improved discriminatory gamma activity at early stages of visual processing. rTMS has the potential to become an important therapeutic tool in ASD treatment and has shown significant benefits in treating core symptoms of ASD with few, if any side effects., keywords: N/A"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

These results suggest that individuals with autism over-process information needed for the successful differentiation of target and novel stimuli. In the present study we examine the effects of low-frequency, repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) on novelty processing as well as behavior and social functioning in 13 individuals with ASD. Our hypothesis was that low-frequency rTMS application to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC) would result in an alteration of the cortical excitatory/inhibitory balance through the activation of inhibitory GABAergic double bouquet interneurons. We expected to find post-TMS differences in amplitude and latency of early and late ERP components. The results of our current study validate the use of low-frequency rTMS as a modulatory tool that altered the disrupted ratio of cortical excitation to inhibition in autism. After rTMS the parieto-occipital P50 amplitude decreased to novel distracters but not to targets; also the amplitude and latency to targets increased for the frontal P50 while decreasing to non-target stimuli. Low-frequency rTMS minimized early cortical responses to irrelevant stimuli and increased responses to relevant stimuli. Improved selectivity in early cortical responses lead to better stimulus differentiation at later-stage responses as was made evident by our P3b and P3a component findings. These results indicate a significant change in early, middle-latency and late ERP components at the frontal, centro-parietal, and parieto-occipital regions of interest in response to target and distracter stimuli as a result of rTMS treatment. Overall, our preliminary results show that rTMS may prove to be an important research tool or treatment modality in addressing the stimulus hypersensitivity characteristic of autism spectrum disorders., keywords: Adolescent, Adult, Autistic Disorder, Behavior, Cerebral Cortex, Child, Electroencephalography, Evoked Potentials, Female, Humans, Hyperkinesis, Interneurons, Male, Mental Processes, Photic Stimulation, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Reaction Time, Social Behavior, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Young Adult"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

There was some improvement, which suggests some benefits of Panax ginseng, at least as an add-on therapy., keywords: Adolescent, Adult, Autistic Disorder, Communication, Humans, Interpersonal Relations, Male, Nootropic Agents, Observation, Panax, Phytotherapy, Piracetam, Plant Extracts, Qualitative Research, Young Adult"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

Influenced by various theoretical hypotheses, therapeutic programs are typically structured on a psychodynamic, biological or educative basis. Presently, educational strategies are recommended in the treatment of autism, without excluding other approaches when they are necessary. Some authors recommend dietetic or complementary approaches to the treatment of autism, which often stimulates great interest in the parents but also provokes controversy for professionals. Nevertheless, professionals must be informed about this approach because parents are actively in demand of it. First of all, enzymatic disorders and metabolic errors are those most frequently evoked in the literature. The well-known phenylalanine hydroxylase deficit responsible for phenylketonuria has been described as being associated with autism. In this case, adapted diet prevents mental retardation and autistic symptoms. Some enzymatic errors are also corrected by supplementation with uridine or ribose for example, but these supplementations are the responsibility of specialized medical teams in the domain of neurology and cannot be applied by parents alone. Secondly, increased opoid activity due to an excess of peptides is also supposed to be at the origin of some autistic symptoms. Gluten-free or casein-free diets have thus been tested in controlled studies, with contradictory results. With such diets, some studies show symptom regression but others report negative side effects, essentially protein malnutrition. Methodological bias, small sample sizes, the use of various diagnostic criteria or heterogeneity of evaluation interfere with data analysis and interpretation, which prompted professionals to be cautious with such diets. The third hypothesis emphasized in the literature is the amino acid domain. Some autistic children lack some amino acids such as glutamic or aspartic acids for example and this deficiency would create autistic symptoms. However, for some authors, these deficits are attributed to nutritional deficits caused by the food selectivity of children. A fourth hypothesis concerning metabolic implication in autism is the suspicion that a food allergy phenomenon could interfere with development, and it has been observed that Ig levels are higher in autistic children than in control children. Autistic children with a positive reaction to food Ig would have a more favourable outcome with diet excluding some kinds of food; but most of those diets are drastic and ethically debatable. Fifth, glucidic catabolism could be deleterious with an excess of ketonic products that will initiate comitial seizures. Few studies with ketogenic diet have been conducted but, as it has been described with epileptic subjects, those diets would diminish autistic symptoms. Not enough studies have been conducted that would allow one to draw any firm conclusions. The sixth hypothesis is linked with vitamin deficiencies that are a notably important area of research in the treatment of autism. Vitamin B12 or B6 deficiencies have been studied in several articles, and many of them were controlled studies. French teams also emphasize an interest in supplementation with B12 or B6. The two last hypotheses concern auto-immune patterns and the toxic effects of heavy metals like mercury. There is a paucity of methodologically satisfying studies that support these two hypotheses and diet recommendations. Following these assumptions, some dietetic approaches have been recommended, even though the methodological aspects of supporting studies are poor. The most famous diet is the gluten-free and/or casein-free diet. Only two controlled studies attracted our attention. Even if for some autistic children such a diet was positive, for others, gluten-free or casein-free diets were poorly tolerated and, for some authors, not without considerable side effects, the more prejudicial of which was the Kwashiorkor risk. Ketogenic diets have been studied in one non controlled study, but even if positive results have been noted by the authors, the ketogenic diet is very restricting and the long term effects have not been evaluated. Vitamin supplementation is the one and only diet domain where there have been many repeated and placebo-controlled studies. Side effects are rare and mild even if high doses of vitamin B6 are advocated in these studies. In total, as evoked by Rimland, 11 controlled placebo-blind studies have been conducted and 50% of autistic children with this supplementation had improved autistic signs. However, these results still remain debated. Finally, more rarely, enzymatic abnormalities need specific diets which have some positive consequences, but such diets could not be applied by parents alone and are the responsibility of specialized teams. For discussion purposes we can emphasize that, in spite of the amount of studies concerning the effects of specialized diets, few are methodologically satisfying. We can not ignore that some side effects are possible with such approaches and parents need to be informed of them. Some are even potentially serious, such as diets with metal chelators. In spite of those results, vitamin supplementation seems to be the only one that some specialized teams in autism could apply, always with parent agreement. In conclusion, within this scientific field, studies on eating habits of autistic children should be conducted because of their food selectivity or avoidance., keywords: Autistic Disorder, Child, Complementary Therapies, Diet Therapy, Dietary Supplements, Humans, Vitamins"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated positive effects in both short-term and longer term studies.

Whether such changes lead to significant improvements in terms of greater independence and vocational and social functioning in adulthood is also unknown. Given the few randomized controlled treatment trials that have been carried out, the few models that have been tested, and the large differences in interventions that are being published, it is clear that the field is still very early in the process of determining (a) what kinds of interventions are most efficacious in early autism, (b) what variables moderate and mediate treatment gains and improved outcomes following intervention, and (c) the degree of both short-term and long-term improvements that can reasonably be expected.

While controlled by a remote experimenter, Keepon interacted with the children with its simple appearance and actions. With a sense of curiosity and security, the children spontaneously approached Keepon and engaged in dyadic interaction with it, which then extended to triadic interactions where they exchanged with adult caregivers pleasure and surprise they found in Keepon. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of these unfolding interactions suggests that autistic children possess the motivation to share mental states with others, which is contrary to the commonly held position that this motivation is impaired in autism. We assume Keepon's minimal expressiveness helped the children understand socially meaningful information, which then activated their intact motivation to share interests and feelings with others. We conclude that simple robots like Keepon would facilitate social interaction and its development in autistic children., keywords: Autistic Disorder, Child, Preschool, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Female, Humans, Infant, Interpersonal Relations, Male, Pilot Projects, Play and Playthings, Robotics, Social Behavior"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

The review critiques the randomized controlled trials of psychological debriefing, and early provision of cognitive behavior therapy. The latter approach involves therapy attention on acutely traumatized individuals who are high risk for PTSD development, and particularly in people with acute stress disorder (ASD). Psychological debriefing does not prevent PTSD. Cognitive behaviour therapy strategies have proven efficacy in reducing subsequent PTSD in ASD populations.

More specifically, this study sought to clarify if changes in children's participation, engagement, and initiation of social interaction could be observed following an 11-week intervention. Three preschool children with autism spectrum disorders and their mothers participated in an 11-week intervention program. The intervention taught parents to follow the children's lead, promote children's participation in routines, and model language at the children's level. Outcome measures included estimates of parents' responsive language input, and measures of children's rate of communication, number of engagements in social interaction, and initiations. The results indicated that all three mothers increased their responsive comments during play interactions and were rated as being more responsive on a rating scale. All three children evidenced positive outcomes in vocabulary and the number of engagements in social interaction. In addition, improvement was observed in social initiation skills for all three children.

Whereas the safety and efficacy of risperidone have been established for children aged 5 and older, they has not been adequately tested in preschool children. A randomized placebo-controlled study of risperidone in preschool children was conducted in a sample of young children, most of whom were also undergoing intensive behavioral treatment. Preschool children tolerated low-dose risperidone well with no serious adverse effects observed over a 6-month treatment period. Weight gain and hypersalivation were the most common side effects reported, and hyperprolactinemia without lactation or related signs was observed. Significant differences between groups found at baseline complicated the analyses; however, controlling for some of these differences revealed that preschoolers on risperidone demonstrated greater improvements in autism severity. The change in autism severity scores from baseline to 6-month follow up for the risperidone group was 8% compared to 3% for the placebo group. Notably, both groups significantly improved over the 6-month treatment period. Study findings suggest that risperidone is well tolerated in preschoolers over a 6-month period, but that only minimally greater improvement in target symptoms was evident in the risperidone group, possibly due to the differences between groups at baseline or due to the small sample size.

Close interaction and joint attention to task play an important role in both group and individual therapy activities. The goal of treatment was to improve social competence (SC) which was construed as reflecting three components: (1) motivation to initiate social contact with peers; (2) ability to sustain interaction with peers for a period of time: and (3) overcoming autistic symptoms of aloofness and rigidity. Measures for the first two variables were based on observation of subjects in unstructured situations with peers; and the third variable was assessed using a structured rating scale, the SI subscale of the GARS.

Although many researchers have noted the importance of joint attention deficits in the development of children with autism (e.g., Mundy, Sigman, & Kasari, 1994) and have called for intervention strategies (e.g., Mundy & Crowson, 1997), few studies have attempted to target joint attention. In this study, joint attention behaviors were taught to children with autism using a behavior modification procedure. A multiple-baseline design was implemented to evaluate intervention effects. The following target behaviors were included in the intervention: 1) Responding to showing, pointing, and gaze shifting of adult; 2) Coordinated gaze shifting (i.e., coordinated joint attention); and 3) Pointing (with the purpose of sharing, not requesting). Generalization to setting and parent, follow-up sessions, and social validation measures were also analyzed. Joint attention behaviors were effectively trained and targeted behaviors generalized to other settings. In addition, positive changes were noted by naive observers using social validation measures.

Twenty-four children meeting ICD-10 criteria for childhood autism (mean age = 23 months) were identified using the CHAT screen and randomised to the parent training group or to local services only. A follow-up was conducted 12 months later (mean age = 35 months). There was some evidence that the parent training group made more progress in language development than the local services group. However, the present pilot study was compromised by several factors: a reliance on parental report to measure language, non-matching of the groups on initial IQ, and a lack of systematic checking regarding the implementation of the parent training intervention.

Cerebrospinal fluid inositol has been reported as decreased in depression. A double-blind controlled trial of 12 g daily of inositol in 28 depressed patients for four weeks was performed. Significant overall benefit for inositol compared to placebo was found at week 4 on the Hamilton Depression Scale. No changes were noted in hematology, kidney or liver function. Since many antidepressants are effective in panic disorder, twenty-one patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia completed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, four week, random-assignment crossover treatment trial of inositol 12 g per day. Frequency and severity of panic attacks and severity of agoraphobia declined significantly with inositol compared to placebo. Side-effects were minimal. Since serotonin re-uptake inhibitors benefit obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and inositol is reported to reverse desensitization of serotonin receptors, thirteen patients with OCD completed a double-blind controlled crossover trial of 18 g inositol or placebo for six weeks each. Inositol significantly reduced scores of OCD symptoms compared with placebo. A controlled double-blind crossover trial of 12 g daily of inositol for a month in twelve anergic schizophrenic patients, did not show any beneficial effects.

Eleven children, mean age 8.9 +/- 3.6 years were enrolled in an eight week trial of inositol or placebo at a dose of 200 mg/kg body weight. Results show a trend for aggravation of the syndrome with myo-inositol as compared to placebo.

The present experiment assessed collateral effects of two very different parent training paradigms during unstructured dinnertime interactions in the family setting. One paradigm focused on teaching individual target behaviors (ITB) serially, and the other focused on a recently developed naturalistic paradigm that teaches the pivotal responses (PRT) of motivation and responsivity to multiple cues.

Pretraining and post-parent-training videotapes of dinnertime interactions were scored in a random order across four interactional scales (level of happiness, interest, stress, and style of communication). Results obtained for the four interactional scales showed that the families in both conditions initially scored in the neutral range, and the ITB training paradigm produced no significant influence on the interactions from pretraining to posttraining.

However other drugs, such as dopaminergic agonists or antagonists, have therapeutic effects. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that two dopaminergic (DA) drugs have a similar 5-HT effect underlying the therapeutic efficiency. We evaluated in a randomized, double-blind and cross-over study, the effects of a DA agonist (bromocriptine) and a DA antagonist (amisulpride) on platelet 5-HT in infantile autism. The prolactinemia, reflecting the DA action, has been also measured. Nine children, aged from 4 to 13 years, according to the DSM III for infantile autism, received either drug in a random order during four weeks with an in-between placebo period of six weeks. The dosages of platelet 5-HT and serum prolactin were carried out at the beginning and at the end of every phase of treatment (active or placebo) with radioenzymology and radioimmunoassay methods respectively. The principal results on serum prolactin show neither order x treatment interaction, nor order effect but a significant treatment effect (p < 0.01): amisulpride increases serum prolactin whereas bromocriptine decreases according to the usual data. About platelet 5-HT, there is neither order x treatment interaction, nor treatment effect but a significant order effect (p < 0.01). Both drugs increase platelet 5-HT in the first phase of treatment.

Despite their prevalence and impact, there are no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed at evaluating the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for anxiolysis in this population, who may have a different biological basis for anxiety. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Secondary analyses of the STAART double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT of citalopram in children with ASD examined whether citalopram reduced anxiety measured on the parent-reported Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory-4 (CASI-4) as the primary outcome. An intention-to-treat analysis involving all 149 participants used multiple imputations for missing data and included baseline stratification factors of age group and site, among others. We prespecified as clinically significant a 33% reduction in anxiety in citalopram versus placebo, coinciding with 80% power. We tested whether communicative ability on the Vineland Communication score moderated treatment effect and explored whether initial anxiety was associated with greater adverse events, which could impact on dose titration and achieving optimal dose. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Both groups showed substantial reduction in anxiety.

Secondary objectives are to explore the effects of memantine at the level of structure, function and biochemistry of the fronto-striatal circuits, and to collect blood for genetic analyses and biomarkers. Tertiary objectives are to explore the role of new candidate genes and pathways for compulsivity by linking genes to clinical phenotypes, response to treatment, neurocognitive test performance, and key structural and functional neuroimaging measures of the fronto-striatal circuits and to explore biomarkers/proteomics for compulsivity traits. This study is part of the large, translational project TACTICS ( http://www.tactics-project.eu/ ) that is funded by the European Union and investigates the neural, genetic and molecular factors involved in the pathogenesis of compulsivity.

These findings raise the specificity of these two drugs which appear to act preferentially on some target symptoms and are consistent with some clinical and pharmacological observations showing a sedative effect with low doses of DA agonists and a stimulant effect with low doses of DA antagonists such as the benzamides., keywords: Adolescent, Amisulpride, Antipsychotic Agents, Autistic Disorder, Brain, Bromocriptine, Child, Child, Preschool, Dopamine Antagonists, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Receptors, Dopamine, Sulpiride"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

MDMA increases social behavior in animal models and has shown promise in psychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). How it produces these prosocial effects is not known. This behavioral and psychophysiological study examined the effects of MDMA, compared with the prototypical stimulant methamphetamine (MA), on two measures of social behavior in healthy young adults: (i) responses to socially relevant, \"affective\" touch, and (ii) visual attention to emotional faces. Men and women (N\u2009=\u200936) attended four sessions in which they received MDMA (0.75 or 1.5\u2009mg/kg), MA (20\u2009mg), or a placebo in randomized order under double-blind conditions. Responses to experienced and observed affective touch (i.e., being touched or watching others being touched) were assessed using facial electromyography (EMG), a proxy of affective state. Responses to emotional faces were assessed using electrooculography (EOG) in a measure of attentional bias. Subjective ratings were also included. We hypothesized that MDMA, but not MA, would enhance the ratings of pleasantness and psychophysiological responses to affective touch and increase attentional bias toward positive facial expressions. Consistent with this, we found that MDMA, but not MA, selectively enhanced ratings of pleasantness of experienced affective touch. Neither drug altered the ratings of pleasantness of observed touch. On the EOG measure of attentional bias, MDMA, but not MA, increased attention toward happy faces. These results provide new evidence that MDMA can enhance the experience of positive social interactions; in this case, pleasantness of physical touch and attentional bias toward positive facial expressions. The findings are consistent with evidence that the prosocial effects are unique to MDMA relative to another stimulant.

The search for psychotherapeutic options for autistic individuals is imperative considering the lack of effective conventional treatments for mental health diagnoses that are common in this population. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) involving the administration of MDMA in clinical trials have been rare and non-life threatening. To date, MDMA has been administered to over 1133 individuals for research purposes without the occurrence of unexpected drug-related SAEs that require expedited reporting per FDA regulations. Now that safety parameters for limited use of MDMA in clinical settings have been established, a case can be made to further develop MDMA-assisted therapeutic interventions that could support autistic adults in increasing social adaptability among the typically developing population. As in the case with classic hallucinogens and other psychedelic drugs, MDMA catalyzes shifts toward openness and introspection that do not require ongoing administration to achieve lasting benefits. This infrequent dosing mitigates adverse event frequency and improves the risk/benefit ratio of MDMA, which may provide a significant advantage over medications that require daily dosing. Consequently, clinicians could employ new treatment models for social anxiety or similar types of distress administering MDMA on one to several occasions within the context of a supportive and integrative psychotherapy protocol., keywords: Adult, Anxiety Disorders, Autistic Disorder, Double-Blind Method, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, N-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, Patient Selection, Pilot Projects, Prospective Studies, Psychotropic Drugs, Research Design, Social Perception"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

During rivalry, perception alternates between the two eyes, and the ebb and flow of perception is modeled to rely on the strength of inhibitory interactions between competitive neuronal populations in visual cortex. As a result, rivalry has been suggested as a noninvasive perceptual marker of inhibitory signaling in visual cortex, and its putative disturbance in psychiatric conditions, including autism. Yet, direct evidence causally implicating inhibitory signaling in the dynamics of binocular rivalry is currently lacking. We previously found that people with higher GABA levels in visual cortex, measured using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, have stronger perceptual suppression during rivalry. Here, we present direct causal tests of the impact of GABAergic inhibition on rivalry dynamics, and the contribution of specific GABA receptors to these dynamics. In a crossover pharmacological design with male and female adult participants, we found that drugs that modulate the two dominant GABA receptor types in the brain, GABA<sub>A</sub> (clobazam) and GABA<sub>B</sub> (arbaclofen), increase perceptual suppression during rivalry relative to a placebo. Crucially, these results could not be explained by changes in reaction times or response criteria, as determined through rivalry simulation trials, suggesting a direct and specific influence of GABA on perceptual suppression. A full replication study of the GABA<sub>B</sub> modulator reinforces these findings. These results provide causal evidence for a link between the strength of inhibition in the brain and perceptual suppression during rivalry and have implications for psychiatric conditions including autism.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How does the brain accomplish perceptual gating?

Despite its high prevalence, reaching 1/54 children and 1/45 adults in the United States, no pharmacological treatment is still directed to core symptoms of ASD, encompassing social and communication deficits, repetitive behaviors, restricted interests, and abnormal sensory processing. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art of psychopharmacological therapy available today for ASD in children and adolescents, in order to foster best practices and to organize new strategies for future research. To date, atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone and aripiprazole represent the first line of intervention for hyperactivity, impulsivity, agitation, temper outbursts or aggression towards self or others. Tricyclic antidepressants are less prescribed because of uncertain efficacy and important side effects. SSRIs, especially fluoxetine and sertraline, may be effective in treating repetitive behaviors (anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms) and irritability/agitation, while mirtazapine is more helpful with sleep problems. Low doses of buspirone have shown some efficacy on restrictive and repetitive behaviors in combination with behavioral interventions. Stimulants, and to a lesser extent atomoxetine, are effective in reducing hyperactivity, inattention and impulsivity also in comorbid ASD-ADHD, although with somewhat lower efficacy and greater incidence of side effects compared to idiopathic ADHD. Clonidine and guanfacine display some efficacy on hyperactivity and stereotypic behaviors. For several other drugs, case reports and open-label studies suggest possible efficacy, but no randomized controlled trial has yet been performed. Research in the pediatric psychopharmacology of ASD is still faced with at least two major hurdles: (a) Great interindividual variability in clinical response and side effect sensitivity is observed in the ASD population. This low level of predictability would benefit from symptom-specific treatment algorithms and from biomarkers to support drug choice; (b) To this date, no psychoactive drug appears to directly ameliorate core autism symptoms, although some indirect improvement has been reported with several drugs, once the comorbid target symptom is abated., keywords: Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic, Antipsychotic Agents, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Central Nervous System Stimulants, Child, Clinical Trials as Topic, Humans, Psychopharmacology, Psychotropic Drugs, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

A systematic review and network meta-analysis were conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of atypical antipsychotics in treating irritability in these patients. Studies were identified from Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO from inception to March 2018. The clinical trials database was reviewed. Studies were included if they were a double-blind, randomized controlled trial utilizing the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability (ABC-I) to measure the efficacy of atypical antipsychotic monotherapy. Data extraction was carried out following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses for network meta-analysis guidelines. The main outcome was the reduction in irritability score using the ABC-I subscale from baseline. Eight trials comparing four interventions-risperidone, aripiprazole, lurasidone, and placebo in 878 patients, were included. Both risperidone and aripiprazole had significantly reduced ABC-I scores than placebo. Estimates of mean differences (95% credible intervals) were risperidone, -6.89 (-11.14, -2.54); aripiprazole, -6.62 (-10.88, -2.22); and lurasidone, -1.61 (-9.50, 6.23). Both risperidone and aripiprazole had similar safety. There were only eight studies included in the analysis, however, sample sizes were not small. Variance in reporting of adverse effects limited the quality of safety analysis. Risperidone and aripiprazole were the two best drugs, with comparable efficacy and safety in pediatric ASD patients.

This study was a post-hoc analysis of pooled data from two 8-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies evaluating aripiprazole for the treatment of irritability in pediatric subjects with autistic disorder, aged 6-17 years. Subjects were stratified by PAE; adverse events (AEs), and changes in weight, and metabolic measures were evaluated. For subjects receiving aripiprazole, regardless of PAE, baseline weight, age, gender, and symptom severity were evaluated in a regression model predicting body weight change. Of 316 randomized subjects, 259 (82.0%) were antipsychotic na\u00efve (AN) and 57 (18.0%) had a PAE. Aripiprazole-treated AN subjects were more likely than PAE subjects to report somnolence (11.9% vs. 2.8%), sedation (22.7% vs. 11.1%), or fatigue (17.0% vs. 13.9%). Rates of extrapyramidal disorder and drooling, but not akathisia or tremor, were marginally higher in AN subjects. Overall, 10.8% of aripiprazole-treated AN subjects had at least one AE leading to discontinuation compared with 8.3% of aripiprazole-treated PAE subjects. AN subjects receiving aripiprazole had a larger change in weight from baseline to endpoint compared with those receiving placebo (1.9 vs. 0.7 kg; treatment difference 1.2 kg, 95% CI: 0.5, 1.9) than PAE subjects receiving aripiprazole compared with subjects receiving placebo (0.4 vs. -0.4 kg; treatment difference 0.9 kg, 95% CI: -0.6, 2.4). Regression analysis identified that younger subjects with higher baseline weight z-score were at highest risk for weight gain. There were no significant changes in metabolic measures compared with placebo in either group. Weight gain was more pronounced in AN subjects and more likely to occur in younger subjects with a higher baseline weight z-score. AN subjects were more likely to experience AEs related to somnolence. However, based on discontinuations rates from AEs, overall tolerability was good for both AN and PAE groups.

Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic which was recently approved for use in Canada, but has been available for several years in the United States. Pharmacologically, aripiprazole is a partial agonist at D(2) and 5-HT(1A) receptors and an antagonist at 5-HT(2A) receptors. Randomized controlled trial data is available showing efficacy for aripiprazole in the treatment of children and adolescents with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and behavioural problems associated with autism. Open-label evidence is also available for use of aripiprazole in other disorders such as tic disorders, aggression and disruptive behavior disorders. Unlike some other available atypical antipsychotics, there does not appear to be any effect on QTc interval on the electrocardiogram. Adverse effects including extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), akathisia, sedation, headache, nausea were significant in clinical trials in children and adolescents. The possibility of aripiprazole causing tardive dyskinesia cannot be excluded. In this population, aripiprazole appears to have minimal impact on the metabolic profile compared to most other atypical antipsychotics, with minimal changes in weight or body mass index, no significant changes in glucose or lipid metabolism, and a decrease in serum prolactin.

We aimed to assess the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of balovaptan, a vasopressin 1a receptor antagonist, versus placebo in autistic adults. V1aduct was a phase 3, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, conducted at 46 sites across six countries (the USA, the UK, France, Italy, Spain, and Canada). Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older with an intelligence quotient (IQ) of 70 or higher, and met the criteria for moderate-to-severe autism spectrum disorder (DSM-5 and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule). Participants were randomly allocated (1:1), with an independent interactive voice or web-based response system, to receive balovaptan (10 mg) or placebo daily for 24 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by an individual's baseline Vineland-II two-domain composite (2DC) score (<60 or \u226560), sex, region (North America or rest of world), and age (<25 years or \u226525 years).

The endocannabinoid system (ECS) seems to play a role in social behavior and emotional processing while it also seems to play a role in those neuropsychiatric conditions showing social cognition impairments. Main plant cannabinoids delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) modulate the ECS and, due to their opposite effects, have been proposed as both cause and treatment for neuropsychiatric-related disorders such as schizophrenia, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The aim of this study was to test the effects of THC and CBD on social cognition abilities in chronic cannabis users. <b>Method:</b> Eighteen members from a cannabis social club were tested for social cognition effects under the effects of different full spectrum cannabis extracts containing either THC, CBD, THC+CBD, or placebo in a naturalistic randomized double-blind crossover placebo-controlled study. <b>Results:</b> Results showed that participants under the effects of THC showed lower cognitive empathy when compared with the effects of CBD but not when those were compared with THC+CBD or placebo. Also, participants showed higher cognitive ToM under the effects of CBD when compared with the effects of placebo, but not when those were compared with THC or THC+CBD.

We show for the first time that CBD can improve ToM abilities in chronic cannabis users.

To expand intervention options, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of potential treatment targets, and their engagement, in the brain. For instance, the striatum (caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens) plays a central role during development and its (atypical) functional connectivity (FC) may contribute to multiple ASD symptoms. We have previously shown, in the adult autistic and neurotypical brain, the non-intoxicating cannabinoid cannabidivarin (CBDV) alters the balance of striatal 'excitatory-inhibitory' metabolites, which help regulate FC, but the effects of CBDV on (atypical) striatal FC are unknown. To examine this in a small pilot study, we acquired resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 28 men (15 neurotypicals, 13 ASD) on two occasions in a repeated-measures, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. We then used a seed-based approach to (1) compare striatal FC between groups and (2) examine the effect of pharmacological probing (600\u00a0mg CBDV/matched placebo) on atypical striatal FC in ASD. Visits were separated by at least 13\u00a0days to allow for drug washout. Compared to the neurotypicals, ASD individuals had lower FC between the ventral striatum and frontal and pericentral regions (which have been associated with emotion, motor, and vision processing). Further, they had higher intra-striatal FC and higher putamenal FC with temporal regions involved in speech and language. In ASD, CBDV reduced hyperconnectivity to the neurotypical level. Our findings should be considered in light of several methodological aspects, in particular our participant group (restricted to male adults), which limits the generalizability of our findings to the wider and heterogeneous ASD population. In conclusion, here we show atypical striatal FC with regions commonly associated with ASD symptoms.

We tested (1) BOL-DP-O-01-W, a whole-plant cannabis extract containing cannabidiol and \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol at a 20:1 ratio and (2) BOL-DP-O-01, purified cannabidiol and \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol at the same ratio. Participants (N\u2009=\u2009150) received either placebo or cannabinoids for 12-weeks (testing efficacy) followed by a 4-week washout and predetermined cross-over for another 12\u00a0weeks to further assess tolerability. Registered primary efficacy outcome measures were improvement in behavioral problems (differences between whole-plant extract and placebo) on the Home Situation Questionnaire-ASD (HSQ-ASD) and the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale with disruptive behavior anchor points (CGI-I). Secondary measures were Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2) and Autism Parenting Stress Index (APSI). Changes in Total Scores of HSQ-ASD (primary-outcome) and APSI (secondary-outcome) did not differ among groups. Disruptive behavior on the CGI-I (co-primary outcome) was either much or very much improved in 49% on whole-plant extract (n\u2009=\u200945) versus 21% on placebo (n\u2009=\u200947; p\u2009=\u20090.005).

We and others have previously shown that response to drug challenge can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), but that pharmacological responsivity is atypical in ASD.

To test this, task-free fMRI was acquired in 34 healthy men (half with ASD) following oral administration of 600 mg CBD or matched placebo (random order; double-blind administration). The 'fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations' (fALFF) was measured across the whole brain, and, where CBD significantly altered fALFF, we tested if functional connectivity (FC) of those regions was also affected by CBD. CBD significantly increased fALFF in the cerebellar vermis and the right fusiform gyrus. However, post-hoc within-group analyses revealed that this effect was primarily driven by the ASD group, with no significant change in controls. Within the ASD group only, CBD also significantly altered vermal FC with several of its subcortical (striatal) and cortical targets, but did not affect fusiform FC with other regions in either group.

However, before launching large-scale clinical trials, a\u00a0better understanding of the effects of CBD on brain would be desirable. Preclinical evidence suggests that one aspect of the polypharmacy of CBD is that it modulates brain excitatory glutamate and inhibitory \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels, including in brain regions linked to ASD, such as the basal ganglia (BG) and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC). However, differences in glutamate and GABA pathways in ASD mean that the response to CBD in people with and without ASD may be not be the same. To test whether CBD 'shifts' glutamate and GABA levels; and to\u00a0examine potential\u00a0differences in this response\u00a0in ASD, we used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure glutamate (Glx\u2009=\u2009glutamate\u2009+\u2009glutamine) and GABA+ (GABA\u2009+\u2009macromolecules) levels in 34 healthy men (17 neurotypicals, 17 ASD).

Across regions, CBD increased GABA+ in controls, but decreased GABA+ in ASD; the group difference in change in GABA\u2009+\u2009in the DMPFC was significant.

However, the molecular underpinnings of autistic-neurotypical serotonergic differences are challenging to access in vivo. Receptor-Enriched Analysis of functional Connectivity by Targets (REACT) has helped define molecular-enriched functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain networks based on a priori information about the spatial distribution of neurochemical systems from available PET templates. We used REACT to estimate the dominant fMRI signal related to the serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT) distribution during processing of aversive facial emotion in adults with and without ASD. We first predicted a group difference in baseline (placebo) functioning of this system. We next used a single 20\u2009mg oral dose of citalopram, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, to test the hypothesis that network activity in people with and without ASD would respond differently to inhibition of SERT. To confirm the specificity of our findings, we also repeated the analysis with 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A and 5-HT4 receptor maps. Using REACT with the SERT map, we found a baseline group difference in the SERT-enriched response to faces in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. A single oral dose of citalopram 'shifted' the response in the ASD group towards the neurotypical baseline but did not alter response in the control group. Similar differences in SERT-enriched response were observed after controlling for other 5-HT maps.

It has been suggested that some core symptoms in ASD are underpinned by deficits in executive functioning (EF). Hence, we investigated the role of the SSRI citalopram on EF networks in 19 right-handed adult males with ASD and 19 controls who did not differ in gender, age, IQ or handedness. We performed pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare brain activity during two EF tasks (of response inhibition and sustained attention) after an acute dose of 20\u2009mg citalopram or placebo using a randomised, double-blind, crossover design. Under placebo condition, individuals with ASD had abnormal brain activation in response inhibition regions, including inferior frontal, precentral and postcentral cortices and cerebellum. During sustained attention, individuals with ASD had abnormal brain activation in middle temporal cortex and (pre)cuneus. After citalopram administration, abnormal brain activation in inferior frontal cortex was 'normalised' and most of the other brain functional differences were 'abolished'. Also, within ASD, the degree of responsivity in inferior frontal and postcentral cortices to SSRI challenge was related to plasma serotonin levels. These findings suggest that citalopram can 'normalise' atypical brain activation during EF in ASD.

The core symptoms of autism are abnormalities in social interaction, communication and behaviour. The involvement of neurotransmitters such as 5-HT has been suggested in neuropsychiatric disorders and particularly in autistic disorder. Increased platelet 5-HT levels were found in 40% of the autistic population, suggesting that hyperserotonaemia may be a pathologic factor in infantile autism. Therefore, it is of interest to assess the efficacy of cyproheptadine, a 5-HT2 antagonist in the treatment of autistic disorder. In this 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we assessed the effects of cyproheptadine plus haloperidol in the treatment of autistic disorder. Children between the ages 3 and 11 years (inclusive) with a DSM IV clinical diagnosis of autism and who were outpatients from a specialty clinic for children at Roozbeh Psychiatric Teaching Hospital were recruited. The children presented with a chief complaint of severely disruptive symptoms related to autistic disorder. Patients were randomly allocated to cyproheptadine + haloperidol (Group A) or haloperidol + placebo (Group B) for an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The dose of haloperidol and cyproheptadine was titrated up to 0.05 and 0.2 mg/kg/day respectively. Patients were assessed by a third-year resident of psychiatry at baseline and after 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks of starting medication. The primary measure of the outcome was the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist-Community (ABC-C) and the secondary measure of the outcome was the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (relating to people and verbal communication). Side effects and extrapyramidal symptoms were systematically recorded throughout the study and were assessed using a checklist and the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale, administered by a resident of psychiatry during weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8. The ABC-C and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale scores improved with cyproheptadine. The behaviour of the two treatments was not homogeneous across time (groups-by-time interaction, Greenhouse-Geisser correction; F = 7.30, d.f. = 1.68, P = 0.002; F = 8.21, d.f. = 1.19, P = 0.004 respectively).

There is currently no reference treatment or specific pharmacological treatment recommendation on the management of sleep disturbances in children and adolescents suffering from PTSD, despite the fact that they have a significant effect on daytime functioning and overall mental health of children as well as on family's health and quality of life. In this respect, paediatric prolonged-release melatonin (PedPRM) has shown significant beneficial effects on insomnia disorders in children with autism spectrum disorders and positive effects on anxiety and depressive symptomatology.

This is a randomized, 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at the children's autism clinic of Roozbeh Hospital (Tehran, Iran) from March 2024 to May 2024. Participants were divided into two groups of risperidone plus metformin (500\u2009mg per day) and risperidone plus placebo and were assessed at baseline, weeks 5 and 10 with the aberrant behavior checklist-community scale (ABC-C). A total of 55 patients were included in the final analysis. Irritability (primary outcome measure) sharply decreased in the metformin compared to the placebo group (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.008). Among the other four subscales of ABC-C, the hyperactivity/noncompliance score showed a significant drop during the baseline-to-week-5 period (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.021). In addition, inappropriate speech subscales decreased significantly from baseline-to-week 5 in the metformin compared to the placebo group (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.045). No other significant finding was observed among ABC-C scores for lethargy/social withdrawal or stereotypic behavior subscales. Metformin demonstrated promising results in reducing irritability in ASD patients, which is in concordance with previous studies. However, further studies are required before any broad clinical recommendation., keywords: Humans, Metformin, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Double-Blind Method, Irritable Mood, Male, Female, Risperidone, Child, Child, Preschool, Drug Therapy, Combination, Antipsychotic Agents, Iran, Treatment Outcome, Hypoglycemic Agents"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

Unfortunately, these medications are associated with weight gain and metabolic complications that are especially troubling in children and with long-term use. To evaluate the efficacy of metformin for weight gain associated with atypical antipsychotic medications in children and adolescents with ASD (defined in the protocol as DSM-IV diagnosis of autistic disorder, Asperger disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified), aged 6 to 17 years. A 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial was conducted at 4 centers in Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Columbus, Ohio; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Nashville, Tennessee. In all, 209 potential participants were screened by telephone, 69 individuals provided consent, and 61 participants were randomized to receive metformin or placebo between April 26, 2013, and June 24, 2015. Metformin or matching placebo titrated up to 500 mg twice daily for children aged 6 to 9 years and 850 mg twice daily for those 10 to 17 years.

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy and diffusion imaging were performed at term age equivalent. Development was followed for cerebral palsy or autism to 4\u00a0years of age. Cardiovascular measures, cerebral blood flow velocity and vascular resistance, and cerebral oxygenation did not differ between treatment groups. Cerebrovascular coupling was disrupted in infants with chorioamnionitis treated with saline but preserved in infants treated with NAC, suggesting improved vascular regulation in the presence of neuroinflammation. Infants treated with NAC had higher serum anti-inflammatory interleukin-1 receptor antagonist and lower proinflammatory vascular endothelial growth factor over time vs controls. No adverse events related to NAC administration were noted. In this cohort of newborns exposed to chorioamnionitis, antenatal and postnatal NAC was safe, preserved cerebrovascular regulation, and increased an anti-inflammatory neuroprotective protein.

Therapeutic trials with naltrexone]., abstract: The opioid hypothesis suggests that childhood autism may result from excessive brain opioid activity during neonatal period which may constitutionally inhibit social motivation, yielding autistic isolation and aloofness (Panksepp, 1979). This hypothesis has now received strong support and is currently based on three types of arguments: (1) similarity between autistic symptomatology and abnormal behaviors induced in young animals by injections of exogenous opioids, such as increasing social aloofness and decreasing social vocalization; (2) direct biochemical evidence of abnormalities of peripheral endogenous opioids being reported in autism and (3) therapeutic effects of the long lasting opioid receptor blocking agent naltrexone in autism. In this article, we give description of open and double-blind studies of naltrexone in autism. Naltrexone has been tested in several open studies. We performed an open trial with naltrexone in 2 autistic girls, displaying serious self-injurious behavior, reduced crying and a marked preference for salty and spicy foods, symptoms that could be related to a dysfunction of the opioid system. With dosages of 1 mg/kg/day, we observed an immediate reduction of hyperactivity, self-injurious behavior and aggressiveness, while attention improved. In addition, social behaviors, smiling, social seeking behaviors and play interactions increased (Leboyer, Bouvard et Dugas, 1988). Campbell et al. (1988) has also reported a tranquilizing and a stimulating effect in 6 out of 8 children with autism.

In particular, some studies have shown that children with ADHD may have lower concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly omega-3, in their red blood cells and plasma, and that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids may alleviate behavioural symptoms in this population. However, in order to compare levels it seems appropriate to establish fatty acid levels in a mainstream school aged population and if levels relate to learning and behaviour. To date no study has established this. For this study, cheek cell samples from 411 typically developing school children were collected and analysed for PUFA content, in order to establish the range in this population. In addition, measures of general classroom attention and behaviour were assessed in these children by teachers and parents. Cognitive performance tests were also administered in order to explore whether an association between behaviour and/or cognitive performance and PUFA levels exists. Relationships between PUFA levels and socio-economic status were also explored. Measures of reading, spelling and intelligence did not show any association with PUFA levels, but some associations were noted with the level of omega-3 fatty acids and teacher and parental reports of behaviour, with some evidence that higher omega-3 levels were associated with decreased levels of inattention, hyperactivity, emotional and conduct difficulties and increased levels of prosocial behaviour.

However, in prior trials, autistic individuals with co-occurring intellectual disability (ID) have largely been overlooked, despite their high prevalence, poorer outcome, and the enhanced need but reduced availability of therapeutic interventions. Prior studies have also overlooked the importance of standardizing the context in which oxytocin is administered, rendering outcomes from prior trials inconclusive. To meet these limitations, we propose a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial investigating the effects of intermittent multiple-dose intranasal oxytocin administration (4 weeks, 24 IU 3x/week), administered within a standardized psychosocial stimulating context at special need schools, in 80 children with autism and co-occurring ID (4-13 years old). Clinical-behavioral as well as stress-regulatory effects of oxytocin will be evaluated using the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC), the Brief Observation of Social Communication Change (BOSCC) expert rating scale, and measurements of high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), a validated index of parasympathetic autonomic nervous system activity. To assess the possibility of retention and/or late-emerging effects, outcomes will be assessed immediately after the administration regime, and at two follow-up sessions, four-weeks and six months after administration. Significant clinical-behavioral improvements on the ATEC and BOSCC, and significantly higher parasympathetic HF-HRV power in the oxytocin compared to the placebo group would confirm beneficial clinical-behavioral and stress-regulatory effects of oxytocin in autistic children with co-occurring ID.

Presently, oxytocin nasal spray has shown significant potential in the treatment of stress-related neuropsychiatric diseases. However, there are few reports on the use of oxytocin nasal spray in postoperative ASD, a condition that can potentially develop into a high-risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorder. This study aims to investigate the effect of pretreatment with oxytocin nasal spray on postoperative ASD in patients with accidental trauma and fracture to provide new clinical insights for the prevention of postoperative ASD. This study is a single-centre, double-blind, randomised controlled clinical trial. The trial aims to recruit 328 patients with accidental traumatic fractures who underwent surgical treatment.

The primary outcome is the incidence of ASD on postoperative days 1-3. Secondary outcomes include patient resilience, anxiety, depression and pain scores on postoperative days 1-3. The exploratory results include the concentrations of stress response indicators such as malondialdehyde, cortisol and superoxide dismutase in the saliva before the first intervention and on days 1-3 after surgery.

No significant diagnostic-group differences were identified between autistic versus non-autistic children with regard to neural face processing.

However, the administration of exogenous OXT in humans produces inconsistent behavioral changes, affecting future consideration of OXT as a treatment for autism and other disorders with social symptoms. Inter-individual variability in social functioning traits might play a key role in how OXT changes brain activity and, therefore, behavior. Here, we investigated if inter-individual variability might dictate how single-dose intranasal OXT administration (IN-OXT) changes spontaneous neural activity during the eyes-open resting state. We used a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over design on 30 typically developing young adult men to investigate the dynamics of EEG microstates corresponding to activity in defined neural networks. We confirmed previous reports that, at the group level, IN-OXT increases the representation of the attention and salience microstates. Furthermore, we identified a decreased representation of microstates associated with the default mode network. Using multivariate partial least square statistical analysis, we found that social functioning traits associated with IN-OXT-induced changes in microstate dynamics in specific spectral bands. Correlation analysis further revealed that the higher the social functioning, the more IN-OXT increased the appearance of the visual network-associated microstate, and suppressed the appearance of a default mode network-related microstate. The lower the social functioning, the more IN-OXT increases the appearance of the salience microstate. The effects we report on the salience microstate support the hypothesis that OXT regulates behavior by enhancing social salience.

During active neural processing, functional integration is facilitated through transitory formations of \"harmonic\" cross-frequency couplings, whereas \"nonharmonic\" decoupling among neural oscillatory rhythms is postulated to characterize the resting, default state of the brain, minimizing the occurrence of spurious, noisy, background couplings. Within this exploratory, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we assessed whether the transient occurrence of nonharmonic and harmonic relationships between peak-frequencies in the alpha (8-14\u2009Hz) and theta (4-8\u2009Hz) bands is impacted by intranasal administration of oxytocin, a neuromodulator implicated in improving homeostasis and reducing stress/anxiety. To do so, resting-state electroencephalography was acquired before and after 4\u2009weeks of oxytocin administration (12\u2009IU twice-daily) in children with autism spectrum disorder (8-12\u2009years, n\u2009=\u200933 oxytocin; n\u2009=\u200934 placebo). At the baseline, neural assessments of children with autism were compared with those of a matched cohort of children without autism (n\u2009=\u200940).

Previous investigations have emphasized the amygdala as the neural foundation for oxytocin's acute effects. However, to fully understand oxytocin's therapeutic potential, it is crucial to gain insight into the neuroplastic changes in amygdala circuitry induced from chronic oxytocin administrations, particularly in pediatric populations. We aimed to examine the impact of a 4-week course of intranasal oxytocin on amygdala functional connectivity in children with autism, compared to placebo. Additionally, we investigated whether oxytocin improves cardiac autonomic arousal, as indexed by high-frequency heart rate variability. Fifty-seven children with autism aged 8-12 years (45 boys, 12 girls) participated in a double-blind, randomized pharmaco-neuroimaging trial involving twice-daily administrations of intranasal oxytocin or placebo. Resting-state fMRI scans and simultaneous, in-scanner heart rate recordings were obtained before, immediately after, and 4 weeks after the nasal spray administration period. Significant reductions in intrinsic amygdala-orbitofrontal connectivity were observed, particularly at the 4-week follow-up session. These reductions were correlated with improved social symptoms and lower cardiac autonomic arousal. Further, oxytocin's neural and cardiac autonomic effects were modulated by epigenetic modifications of the oxytocin receptor gene. The effects were more pronounced in children with reduced epigenetic methylation, signifying heightened expression of the oxytocin receptor. These findings underscore that a 4-week oxytocin administration course decreases amygdala connectivity and improves cardiac autonomic balance.

A randomized controlled trial., abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by difficulties in social communication and interaction. Crucial for efficient social interaction is the ability to quickly and accurately extract information from a person's face. Frequency-tagging electroencephalography (EEG) is a novel tool to quantify face-processing sensitivity in a robust and implicit manner. In terms of intervention approaches, intranasal administration of oxytocin (OT) is increasingly considered as a potential pharmacological approach for improving socio-communicative difficulties in ASD, through enhancing social salience and/or reducing (social) stress and anxiety. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, mechanistic pharmaco-neuroimaging clinical trial, we implemented frequency-tagging EEG to conduct an exploratory investigation into the impact of repeated OT administration (4\u2009weeks, 12\u2009IU, twice daily) on neural sensitivity towards happy and fearful facial expressions in children with ASD (8-12\u2009years old; OT: n\u2009=\u200929; placebo: n\u2009=\u200932). Neural effects were assessed at baseline, post-nasal spray (24\u2009hr after the last nasal spray) and at a follow-up session, 4\u2009weeks after the OT administration period. At baseline, neural assessments of children with ASD were compared with those of an age- and gender-matched cohort of neurotypical (NT) children (n\u2009=\u200939). Children with ASD demonstrated reduced neural sensitivity towards expressive faces, as compared to NT children. Upon nasal spray administration, children with ASD displayed a significant increase in neural sensitivity at the post- and follow-up sessions, but only in the placebo group, likely reflecting an implicit learning effect. Strikingly, in the OT group, neural sensitivity remained unaffected from the baseline to the post-session, likely reflecting a dampening of an otherwise typically occurring implicit learning effect. First, we validated the robustness of the frequency-tagging EEG approach to assess reduced neural sensitivity towards expressive faces in children with ASD. Furthermore, in contrast to social salience effects observed after single-dose administrations, repeated OT administration dampened typically occurring learning effects in neural sensitivity. In line with OT's social anxiolytic account, these observations possibly reflect a predominant (social) stress regulatory effect towards emotionally evocative faces after repeated OT administration., keywords: Child, Humans, Autistic Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Oxytocin, Administration, Intranasal, Nasal Sprays, Double-Blind Method"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

We have previously shown that intranasal administration of oxytocin facilitates the pleasantness of social touch and activation of brain reward and social processing regions, although it is unclear if it influences responses to gentle stroking touch mediated by cutaneous C-touch fibers or pressure touch mediated by other types of fibers. Additionally, it is unclear whether endogenous oxytocin acts via direct entry into the brain or by increased peripheral blood concentrations. In a randomized controlled design, we compared effects of intranasal (direct entry into the brain and increased peripheral concentrations) and oral (only peripheral increases) oxytocin on behavioral and neural responses to social touch targeting C-touch (gentle-stroking) or other (medium pressure without stroking) cutaneous receptors. Although both types of touch were perceived as pleasant, intranasal and oral oxytocin equivalently enhanced pleasantness ratings and responses of reward, orbitofrontal cortex, and social processing, superior temporal sulcus, regions only to gentle-stroking not medium pressure touch. Furthermore, increased blood oxytocin concentrations predicted the pleasantness of gentle stroking touch. The specificity of neural effects of oxytocin on C-touch targeted gentle stroking touch were confirmed by time-course extraction and classification analysis. Increased peripheral concentrations of oxytocin primarily modulate its behavioral and neural responses to gentle social touch mediated by C-touch fibers.

The efficacy of multiple-dose oxytocin administration in children with ASD is, however, not well established. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with parallel design explored the effects of a 4-week intranasal oxytocin administration (12\u00a0IU, twice daily) on parent-rated social responsiveness (Social Responsiveness Scale: SRS-2) in pre-pubertal school-aged children (aged 8-12\u00a0years, 61 boys, 16 girls). Secondary outcomes included a\u00a0questionnaire-based assessment of repetitive behaviors, anxiety, and attachment. Effects of oxytocin were assessed immediately after the administration period and at a follow-up, 4 weeks after the last administration. The double-blind phase was followed by a 4-week single-blind phase during which all participants received intranasal oxytocin. In the double-blind phase, both the oxytocin and placebo group displayed significant pre-to-post-improvements in social responsiveness and secondary questionnaires, but improvements were not specific to the intranasal oxytocin. Notably, in the single-blind phase, participants who were first allocated to intranasal placebo and later changed to intranasal oxytocin displayed a significant improvement in social responsiveness, over and above the placebo-induced improvements noted in the first phase. Participants receiving oxytocin in the first phase also showed a significant further improvement upon receiving a second course of oxytocin, but only at the 4-week follow-up. Further, exploratory moderator analyses indicated that children who received psychosocial trainings (3 or more sessions per month) along with oxytocin administration displayed a more pronounced improvement in social responsiveness. Future studies using larger cohorts and more explicitly controlled concurrent psychosocial trainings are warranted to further explore the preliminary moderator effects, also including understudied populations within the autism spectrum, such as children with co-occurring intellectual disabilities. Four weeks of oxytocin administration did not induce treatment-specific improvements in social responsiveness in school-aged children with ASD. Future studies are warranted to further explore the clinical efficacy of oxytocin administration paired with targeted psychosocial trainings that stimulate socio-communicative behaviors.

However, a gap persists in the literature regarding the potential effects of OT and the neural temporal dynamics due to OT administration. We explored the effect of OT on autistic individuals using magnetoencephalography (MEG), focusing on M100, M170, and M250, social perception-related components that tend to show atypical patterns in autistic individuals. Twenty-five autistic adolescents participated in this randomized, double-blind MEG study. Autistic individuals arrived at the lab twice and received an acute dose of intranasal OT or placebo in each session. During the scans, participants were asked to identify pictures of social and non-social stimuli. Additionally, 23 typically developing (TD) adolescents performed the same task in the MEG as a benchmark that allowed us to better characterize neural regions of interest and behavioral results for this age group in this task. A source-model beamformer analysis revealed that OT enhanced neural activity for social stimuli in frontal regions during M170. Additionally, in each of the preselected time windows, OT increased activation in the left hemisphere, regardless of the content of the presented stimuli. We suggest that OT increased the processing of social stimuli through two separate mechanisms. First, OT increased neural activity in a nonspecific manner, allowing increased allocation of attention toward the stimuli. Second, OT enhanced M170 activity in frontal regions only in response to social stimuli. These results reveal the temporal dynamics of the effects of OT on the early stages of social and non-social perception in autistic adolescents.Trial registration: This study was a part of a project registered as clinical trial October 27th, 2021.

While several studies show that oxytocin (OT) modulates neural activation in social-related neural regions, the mechanism that underlies OT effects in ASD is not fully known yet. Despite evidence from animal studies on connections between the oxytocinergic system and excitation/inhibition neural balance, the influence of OT on oscillatory responses among individuals with ASD has been rarely examined. To bridge these gaps in knowledge, we investigated the effects of OT on both social and non-social stimuli while focusing on its specific influence on the neural connectivity between three socially related neural regions-the left and right fusiform and the medial frontal cortex. Twenty-five adolescents with ASD participated in a wall-established social task during a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled MEG and OT administration study. Our main task was a social-related task that required the identification of social and non-social-related pictures. We hypothesized that OT would modulate the oscillatory connectivity between three pre-selected regions of interest to be more adaptive to social processing. Specifically, we focused on alpha and gamma bands which are known to play an important role in face processing and top-down/bottom-up balance. Compared to placebo, OT reduced the connectivity between the medial frontal cortex and the fusiform in the low gamma more for social stimuli than for non-social ones, a reduction that was correlated with individuals' performance in the task. Additionally, for both social and non-social stimuli, OT increased the connectivity in the alpha and beta bands. Sample size was determined based on sample sizes previously reported in MEG in clinical populations, especially OT administration studies in combination with neuroimaging in ASD. We were limited in our capability to recruit for such a study, and as such, the sample size was not based on a priori power analysis. Additionally, we limited our analyses to specific neural bands and regions. To validate the current results, future studies may be needed to explore other parameters using whole-brain approaches in larger samples. These results suggest that OT influenced social perception by modifying the communication between frontal and posterior regions, an attenuation that potentially impacts both social and non-social early perception. We also show that OT influences differ between top-down and bottom-up processes, depending on the social context. Overall, by showing that OT influences both social-related perception and overall attention during early processing stages, we add new information to the existing understanding of the impact of OT on neural processing in ASD. Furthermore, by highlighting the influence of OT on early perception, we provide new directions for treatments for difficulties in early attentional phases in this population.

Intranasal administration of OXT is widely used to examine the drug's functional effects in both adults and children and is assumed to enter the brain directly via this route. However, OXT can also influence brain function through increased blood concentrations, and we have recently shown that orally (lingual) administered OXT also modulates neural responses to emotional faces and may be better tolerated for therapeutic use. Here, we examine whether 24 IU OXT administered orally can facilitate social attention. In a randomized, placebo-controlled pharmacologic study, we used a validated emotional antisaccade eye-tracking paradigm to explore the effects of oral OXT on bottom-up and top-down attention processing in 80 healthy male participants. Our findings showed that in terms of top-down attention, oral OXT increased errors for both social (angry, fearful, happy, sad, and neutral emotion faces) and nonsocial stimuli (oval shapes) in the antisaccade condition but increased response latencies only in the social condition. It also significantly reduced post-task state anxiety, but this reduction was not correlated with task performance. A comparison with our previous intranasal OXT study using the same task revealed that both routes have a similar effect on increasing antisaccade errors and response latencies and on reducing state anxiety.

However, in two preclinical studies we established that treatment every other day rather than daily is more efficacious in maintaining neural and behavioral effects by reducing receptor desensitization. We aimed to establish whether a 6-week intranasal oxytocin compared with placebo treatment, followed by a period of positive social interaction, would produce reliable symptom improvements in children with ASD.

Monogenic causes of ASD such as PMS are well suited to investigations with novel therapeutics, as interventions can be targeted based on established genetic etiology. While preclinical studies have demonstrated that the neuropeptide oxytocin can reverse electrophysiological, attentional, and social recognition memory deficits in Shank3-deficient rats, there have been no trials in individuals with PMS.

However, no studies have systematically investigated the effects of oxytocin on dynamic or directional aspects of functional connectivity. The present study employed a novel computational framework to investigate these latter aspects in 15 oxytocin-sensitive regions using data from randomized placebo-controlled between-subject resting state functional MRI studies incorporating 200 healthy subjects. In order to characterize the temporal dynamics, the 'temporal state' was defined as a temporal segment of the whole functional MRI signal which exhibited a similar functional interaction pattern among brain regions of interest. Results showed that while no significant effects of oxytocin were found on brain temporal state related characteristics (including temporal state switching frequency, probability of transitions between neighboring states, and averaged dwell time on each state) oxytocin extensively (n\u00a0=\u00a054 links) modulated effective connectivity among the 15 regions. The effects of oxytocin were primarily characterized by increased effective connectivity both between and within emotion, reward, salience, attention and social cognition processing networks and their interactions with the default mode network. Top-down control over emotional processing regions such as the amygdala was particularly affected. Oxytocin also increased effective homotopic interhemispheric connectivity in almost all these regions.

Salivary OT samples were obtained before and after the treatment period as well as at two follow-up sessions, four weeks and one year after cessation of the treatment. Receiving OT intranasally but not placebo reliably increased endogenous salivary levels of OT immediately post-treatment and at the follow-up session four weeks post treatment, indicating an interaction between exogenously administered OT and its endogenous production. Notably, increases in salivary OT at the four-week follow-up session were most pronounced in individuals with larger behavioral improvements in ASD social symptoms. These results suggest that OT's positive effects on social behaviors may lead to a self-perpetuating elevation of OT levels through a feed-forward triggering of its own release. Together, the current investigation provides initial evidence that repeated intranasal administration of OT can induce long-lasting changes in endogenous salivary OT levels, presumably through a positive spiral of OT release., keywords: Administration, Intranasal, Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Double-Blind Method, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Oxytocin"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

Oxytocin (OXT), as a neuropeptide, plays a role in emotional and social behaviors. <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i> (<i>L. reuteri</i>) supplementation led to an OXT-dependent behavioral improvement in ASD mouse models. Despite some promising results from animal studies, little is known about the efficacy of supplementation with <i>L. reuteri</i>, alone or with exogenous OXT therapy, on social-behavioral functions in ASD patients. This paper presents a protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a full trial comparing oral supplementation of <i>L. reuteri</i> probiotics and intranasal OXT spray to placebo on the effect of social and behavioral functions in ASD patients. The study will also capture preliminary estimates of the efficacy of the proposed interventions in ASD patients. This pilot trial is a two-staged, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Throughout the study (0-24 weeks), 60 patients with ASD will be randomly assigned to receive either oral <i>L. reuteri</i> probiotics or placebo. In the second study stage (13-24 weeks), all participants will receive intranasal OXT spray. As primary outcomes, serum OXT levels will be assayed and social behaviors will be assessed via the Autism Behavior Checklist and the Social Responsiveness Scale which are validated questionnaires, an objective emotional facial matching test, and a new video-based eye-tracking test.

We tested how reinforcement learning in social contexts and associated reward prediction error (RPE) signals in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) were modulated by intranasal oxytocin. Male adults with a childhood diagnosis of ASD (n\u2009=\u200915) and healthy controls (n\u2009=\u200924; aged 18-26 years) performed a probabilistic reinforcement learning task during functional magnetic resonance imaging in a single-center (research center in Germany), randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial.

Using computational modeling of behavioral data, trial-by-trial RPE signals were assessed and related to brain activation in NAcc during reinforcing feedback in social and non-social contexts. The order of oxytocin/placebo was randomized for 60 participants. Twenty-one participants were excluded from analyses, leaving 39 for the final analysis.

In the empathizing-systemizing theory of autism, social deficits are described along the continuum of empathizing ability, whereas nonsocial aspects are characterized in terms of an increased preference for patterned or rule-based systems, called systemizing. We therefore developed an automated eye-tracking task to test whether children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared to matched controls display a visual preference for more highly organized and structured (systemized) real-life images. Then, as part of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, we examined the effect of intranasal oxytocin on systemizing preferences in 16 male children with ASD, compared with 16 matched controls. Participants viewed 14 slides, each containing four related pictures (e.g., of people, animals, scenes, or objects) that differed primarily on the degree of systemizing. Visual systemizing preference was defined in terms of the fixation time and count for each image. Unlike control subjects who showed no gaze preference, individuals with ASD preferred to fixate on more highly systemized pictures. Intranasal oxytocin eliminated this preference in ASD participants, who now showed a similar response to control subjects on placebo. In contrast, control participants increased their visual preference for more systemized images after receiving oxytocin versus placebo.

The neuropeptide oxytocin triggers anxiolytic functions and enhances eye gaze, facial emotion recognition and neural correlates of face processing in ASD. Here we investigated whether a single dose of oxytocin increases attention to faces in ASD. As a secondary question, we explored the influence of social anxiety on these effects. We tested for oxytocin's effects on attention to neutral faces as compared to houses in a sample of 29 autistic individuals and 30 control participants using a dot-probe paradigm with two different presentation times (100 or 500\u2009ms). A single dose of 24 IU oxytocin was administered in a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Under placebo, ASD individuals paid less attention to faces presented for 500\u2009ms than did controls. Oxytocin administration increased the allocation of attention toward faces in ASD to a level observed in controls. Secondary analyses revealed that these oxytocin effects primarily occurred in ASD individuals with high levels of social anxiety who were characterized by attentional avoidance of faces under placebo. Our results confirm a positive influence of intranasal oxytocin on social attention processes in ASD. Further, they suggest that oxytocin may in particular restore the attentional preference for facial information in ASD individuals with high social anxiety.

Here, we investigate the impact of oxytocin on resting-state connectivity between subcortical and cortical networks in women. We collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data on 26 typically developing women 40\u2009min following intranasal oxytocin administration using a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design. Independent components analysis (ICA) was applied to examine connectivity between networks. An independent analysis of oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene expression in human subcortical and cortical areas was carried out to determine plausibility of direct oxytocin effects on OXTR. In women, OXTR was highly expressed in striatal and other subcortical regions, but showed modest expression in cortical areas. Oxytocin increased connectivity between corticostriatal circuitry typically involved in reward, emotion, social communication, language and pain processing. This effect was 1.39 standard deviations above the null effect of no difference between oxytocin and placebo. This oxytocin-related effect on corticostriatal connectivity covaried with autistic traits, such that oxytocin-related increase in connectivity was stronger in individuals with higher autistic traits.

We conducted a single-center phase 2, pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, clinical trial in young adults with high-functioning ASD, to determine whether oxytocin dosage and genetic background of the oxytocin receptor affects oxytocin efficacy. This trial consisted of double-blind (12 weeks), open-label (12 weeks) and follow-up phases (8 weeks).

The differences in the NAA levels between the oxytocin and placebo sessions were associated with oxytocin-induced fMRI signal changes in the vmPFC. The oxytocin-induced increases in the fMRI signal could be predicted by the NAA differences between the oxytocin and placebo sessions (P=0.002), an effect that remained after controlling for variability in the time between the fMRI and (1)H-MRS scans (P=0.006) and the order of administration of oxytocin and placebo (P=0.001).

The present randomized placebo (PLC)-controlled within-subject pharmaco-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was designed to test the hypothesis that a single intranasal dose of synthetic OXT (24\u2009IU) would facilitate both neural and emotional responses to interpersonal touch in a context- (female vs male touch) and trait- (autistic trait load) specific manner. Specifically, the experimental rationale was to manipulate the reward value of interpersonal touch independent of the intensity and type of actual cutaneous stimulation administered. Thus, 40 heterosexual males believed that they were touched by either a man or a woman, although in fact an identical pattern of touch was always given by the same female experimenter blind to condition type. Our results show that OXT increased the perceived pleasantness of female, but not male touch, and associated neural responses in insula, precuneus, orbitofrontal, and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex. Moreover, the behavioral and neural effects of OXT were negatively correlated with autistic-like traits. Taken together, this is the first study to show that the perceived hedonic value of human heterosexual interpersonal touch is facilitated by OXT in men, but that its behavioral and neural effects in this context are blunted in individuals with autistic traits., keywords: Administration, Intranasal, Adult, Autistic Disorder, Brain, Brain Mapping, Central Nervous System Agents, Double-Blind Method, Emotions, Heterosexuality, Humans, Interpersonal Relations, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Oxytocin, Reward, Touch Perception"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

The primary aim of this study was to examine the safety/therapeutic effects of intranasal oxytocin versus placebo in adults with ASD, with respect to the two core symptom domains of social cognition/functioning and repetitive behaviors. This was a pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design trial of intranasal oxytocin versus placebo in 19 adults with ASD (16 males; 33.20 \u00b1 13.29 years). Subjects were randomized to 24 IU intranasal oxytocin or placebo in the morning and afternoon for 6 weeks. Measures of social function/cognition (the Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy) and repetitive behaviors (Repetitive Behavior Scale Revised) were administered. Secondary measures included the Social Responsiveness Scale, Reading-the-Mind-in-the-Eyes Test and the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale - compulsion subscale and quality of life (World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire - emotional/social subscales). Full-information maximum-likelihood parameter estimates were obtained and tested using mixed-effects regression analyses.

Human studies indicate that OT administration increases affiliative behavior, including trust, empathy, and social reciprocity. Here, we examine whether OT administration to parent can enhance physiological and behavioral processes that support parental social engagement but, moreover, can have parallel effects on the infant. Utilizing a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, 35 fathers and their 5-month-old infants were observed twice following administration of OT or placebo to father in the face-to-face still-face paradigm. Parent and infant salivary OT were assessed at multiple time points, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was measured in the three face-to-face still-face episodes, and social behaviors of the parent and child were micro-coded for indices of social engagement. Oxytocin administration increased father salivary OT, RSA during free play, and key parenting behaviors that support parental-infant bonding. Parallel increases were also found in the infant's salivary OT, RSA response, and engagement behavior, including social gaze, exploration, and social reciprocity. Results are the first to demonstrate that OT administration to one attachment partner can have parallel effects on the other and underscore the role of OT in the cross-generation transmission of human social participation.

These effects are probably mediated by genetic variations within the OT system. One potential candidate could be the CD38 gene, which codes for a transmembrane protein engaged in OT secretion processes. A common variation in this gene (rs3796863) was recently found to be associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Using an imaging genetics approach, we studied differential effects of an intranasal OT application on neural processing of social stimuli in 55 healthy young men depending on their CD38 gene variant in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design. Genotype had a significant influence on both behavioral and neuronal measures of social processing. Homozygotic risk allele carriers showed slower reaction times (RT) and higher activation of left fusiform gyrus during visual processing of social stimuli. Under OT activation differences between genotypes were more evident (though not statistically significantly increased) and RT were accelerated in homozygotic risk allele carriers. According to our data, rs3796863 mainly influences fusiform gyrus activation, an area which has been widely discussed in ASD research. OT seems to modulate this effect by enhancing activation differences between allele groups, which suggests an interaction between genetic makeup and OT availability on fusiform gyrus activation.

We find that subjects in the oxytocin group show no change in their trusting behavior after they learned that their trust had been breached several times while subjects receiving placebo decrease their trust. This difference in trust adaptation is associated with a specific reduction in activation in the amygdala, the midbrain regions, and the dorsal striatum in subjects receiving oxytocin, suggesting that neural systems mediating fear processing (amygdala and midbrain regions) and behavioral adaptations to feedback information (dorsal striatum) modulate oxytocin's effect on trust.

Our study aimed to compare gut microbiota composition between these disorders and evaluate the effect of probiotic supplementation. We conducted a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 80 children aged 5-14 years (39 with ADHD, 41 with ASD). Baseline and post-intervention fecal samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing to identify changes in gut microbiota composition. We identified 22 taxa differentiating ADHD and ASD (AUC = 0.939), characterised by increased presence of Clostridia, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae in ADHD, and Bacteroides, Bacilli and Actinobacteria in ASD. These differences remained after accounting for potential confounders. ASD children receiving probiotics had significant increases in Chao 1, Fisher's alpha, and Shannon indices whereas no significant differences in \u03b1 and \u03b2-diversity were found in ADHD. In ADHD, bacteria with potential adverse effects were under-represented. In ASD, the abundance of Eggerthellaceae, and other taxa associated with gastrointestinal problems and anxiety was decreased. Variations in gut microbiota may influence responses in ADHD and ASD. Probiotic supplementation favorably altered gut microbiota composition, offering insights for future therapeutic strategies targeting the microbiome in neurodevelopmental disorders. Recent research underscores the role of gut microbiota in ADHD and ASD, indicating that diet can significantly influence microbiota composition and potentially manage these neurodevelopmental disorders. This study reveals distinct differences in gut microbiota composition between children with ADHD and ASD and demonstrates that probiotic supplementation can modulate specific microbial genera in each disorder.

The GI disturbances in ASD might be linked to gut dysbiosis representing the observable phenotype of a \"gut-brain axis\" disruption. The exploitation of strategies which can restore normal gut microbiota and reduce the gut production and absorption of toxins, such as probiotics addition/supplementation in a diet, may represent a non-pharmacological option in the treatment of GI disturbances in ASD.

An ancillary aim is to evaluate possible effects of probiotic supplementation on urinary concentrations of phthalates (chemical pollutants) which have been previously linked to ASD.

Propranolol, a beta-blocker, has accumulated much anecdotal evidence as a promising option. However, well-designed studies are rare, and the apprehension about cardiovascular side effects from large doses continues to exist. The aims of this study were (1) to demonstrate the feasibility of treating aggression with high-dose propranolol using telehealth study visits and (2) to document cardiac safety. This study utilized a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Dosing was titrated up in a flexible but stepwise fashion until therapeutic response was obtained or up to 200 mg tid. Following washout, those who were assigned propranolol were crossed over to placebo and vice versa. Six participants between the ages 12-19 participated. The primary outcome measures were the final Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale (CGI-I) and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Irritability (ABC-C/I) scores at 200 mg tid. The CGI-I indicated a 50% reduction in symptoms in the propranolol phase, while the ABC-I indicated a 37% reduction in comparison to placebo. The effect sizes ( r ) for the CGI-I and the ABC-C/I were large, -0.74 and -0.64, respectively. The average blood pressure was 122/68 during the placebo phase and 109/72 during the propranolol phase.

Reducing noradrenergic activity may improve aspects of network processing and thus improve cognitive abilities, such as verbal problem solving, in individuals with ASD. The present pilot study explores the effects of acute administration of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol on verbal problem solving in adults and adolescents with ASD. In a within-subject crossover-design, 20 participants with ASD received a single dose of propranolol or placebo on one of two sessions in a double-blinded, counterbalanced manner. Verbal problem solving was assessed via an anagram task. Baseline measurements of autonomic nervous system functioning were obtained, and anxiety was assessed at baseline and following drug administration. Participants solved the anagrams more quickly in the propranolol condition, as compared to the placebo condition, suggesting a potential cognitive benefit of this agent. Additionally, we observed a negative linear relationship between response to propranolol on the anagram task and two measures of baseline autonomic activity, as well as a positive linear relationship between drug response and baseline anxiety.

Whereas current pharmacological interventions for ASD focus primarily on psychiatric symptoms, including agitation and obsessive behaviors, few agents target core symptomatology. It has been previously hypothesized that abnormalities in facial scanning, such as reduced eye contact or increased mouth fixation, contribute to social communication deficits in ASD. In addition, previous reports have suggested elevated stress and anxiety in ASD, symptoms that are believed to impact facial scanning patterns. The present pilot study sought to explore the effects of pharmacological intervention via propranolol, a nonselective \u03b2-adrenergic antagonist and known anxiolytic, on facial scanning in ASD. Specifically, we wished to determine whether there is an increase in eye contact and a decrease in mouth fixation with administration of propranolol. A sample of 14 participants with ASD and 14 matched controls participated in two study sessions in which propranolol and placebo were administered in a counterbalanced, double-blinded manner. At each session, ocular fixation data were collected during presentation of video stimuli of 16 human faces. Fixation time on the eye, nose, and mouth regions of the face stimuli was analyzed. The baseline fixation patterns for the ASD and control groups did not significantly differ; however, administration of propranolol was associated with a significant reduction in mouth fixation for the ASD group. Additionally, mouth fixation was positively related to nonverbal communication impairment in the ASD group. Although eye fixation in ASD appears typical in the present study, the effect of propranolol in reducing mouth fixation suggests an important focus for further research.

Thus, an intervention targeting insomnia in ASD seems warranted. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a potentially effective treatment for improving sleep quality and optimizing sleep structure, has already been demonstrated to alleviate insomnia symptoms and sleep disturbance in different neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions. This trial aims to investigate the effects of rTMS on insomnia in patients with ASD. This study is designed to be a double-blind, randomized, and sham-controlled trial with a target sample size of 30 participants (aged 3-13 years) diagnosed with ASD comorbid with insomnia. The intervention phase will comprise 20 sessions of rTMS or sham rTMS applied over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) within four consecutive weeks. The effect of rTMS on insomnia and other symptoms of ASD will be investigated through home-PSG (two consecutive overnights), sleep diary, CSHQ, CARS, ABC, SRS, RBS-R, and metabolomics analysis at baseline and posttreatment. A follow-up assessment 1 month after the intervention will examine the long-term effects. The results of this study may address an important knowledge gap and may provide evidence for the use of rTMS to treat insomnia in ASD.

Fourteen articles were included in this review, including two qualitative articles, one case study, five case series studies, four quasi-experimental studies, and two articles describing one randomized control trial. Findings indicated there is emerging evidence for the use of RO DBT in both adolescents and adults, for disorders characterized by excessive self-control, such as anorexia nervosa and autism, as well as for treatment-resistant depression.

We conducted a multisite, randomized, double-blind trial of risperidone as compared with placebo for the treatment of autistic disorder accompanied by severe tantrums, aggression, or self-injurious behavior in children 5 to 17 years old. The primary outcome measures were the score on the Irritability subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist and the rating on the Clinical Global Impressions - Improvement (CGI-I) scale at eight weeks. A total of 101 children (82 boys and 19 girls; mean [+/-SD] age, 8.8+/-2.7 years) were randomly assigned to receive risperidone (49 children) or placebo (52).

Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology., abstract: Assessment of autistic disorder (autism) symptoms, primary and secondary, poses more challenging problems than ordinarily found in multisite randomized clinical trial (RCT) assessments. For example, subjects may be uncommunicative and extremely heterogeneous in problem presentation, and current pharmacological treatments are not likely to alter most core features of autism. The Autism Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology (RUPP Autism Network) resolved some of these problems during the design of a risperidone RCT in children/adolescents. The inappropriateness of the usual anchors for a Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) was resolved by defining uncomplicated autism without secondary symptoms as a CGI-S of 3, mildly ill. The communication problems, compromising use of the patient as an informant, were addressed by several strategies, including careful questioning of care providers, rating scales, laboratory tests, and physical exams. The broad subject heterogeneity requires outcome measures sensitive to individual change over a wide spectrum of treatment response and side effects. The problems of neuropsychologically testing nonverbal, lower functioning, sometimes noncompliant subjects requires careful instrument selection/adaptation and flexible administration techniques. The problems of assessing low-end IQs, neglected by most standardized test developers, was resolved by an algorithm of test hierarchy. Scarcity of other autism-adapted cognitive and neuropsychological tests and lack of standardization required development of a new, specially adapted battery. Reliability on the Autism Diagnostic Interview (currently the most valid diagnostic instrument) and other clinician instruments required extensive cross-site training (in-person, videotape, and teleconference sessions). Definition of a treatment responder required focus on individually relevant target symptoms, synthesis of possible modest improvements in many domains, and acceptance of attainable though imperfect goals. The assessment strategy developed is implemented in a RCT of risperidone (McDougle et al., 2000) for which the design and other methodological challenges are described elsewhere (Scahill et al., 2000). Some of these problems and solutions are partially shared with RCTs of other treatments and other disorders., keywords: Antipsychotic Agents, Autistic Disorder, Child, Humans, Neuropsychological Tests, Reproducibility of Results, Risperidone, Treatment Outcome"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

We conducted an overview of reviews to synthesize early intervention literature for very young children with or at high likelihood for ASD. Cochrane guidance on how to perform overviews of reviews was followed. Comprehensive searches of databases were conducted for systematic reviews and meta-analyses between January 2009 and December 2020. Review data were extracted and summarized and methodological quality was assessed. Primary randomized controlled trial evidence was summarized and risk of bias assessed. This overview of reviews was not registered. From 762 records, 78 full texts were reviewed and seven systematic reviews and meta-analyses with 63 unique studies were identified. Several interventional approaches (naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention, and developmental and behavioral interventions) improved child developmental outcomes. Heterogeneity in design, intervention and control group, dose, delivery agent, and measurement approach was noted. Inconsistent methodological quality and potential biases were identified. While many early interventional approaches have an impact on child outcomes, study heterogeneity and quality had an impact on our ability to draw firm conclusions regarding which treatments are most effective. Advances in trial methodology and design, and increasing attention to mitigating measurement bias, will advance the quality of the ASD early intervention evidence base. Naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions, as well as developmental and behavioral interventions, improve child outcomes in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). If only randomized controlled trials are considered, guidelines for early intensive behavioral intervention in younger children should be revisited.

Sulforaphane, a supplement with indirect antioxidant effects that are derived from broccoli sprouts and seeds, was recently shown to lead to improvements in behavior and social responsiveness in children with ASD. We conducted the current open-label study to determine if we could identify changes in urinary metabolites that were associated with clinical improvements with the goal of identifying a potential mechanism of action. Children and young adults enrolled in a school for children with ASD and related neurodevelopmental disorders were recruited to participate in a 12-week, open-label study of sulforaphane. Fasting urinary metabolites and measures of behavior (Aberrant Behavior Checklist-ABC) and social responsiveness (Social Responsiveness Scale-SRS) were measured at baseline and at the end of the study. Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated for the pre- to post-intervention change in each of the two clinical scales (ABS and SRS) versus the change in each metabolite. Fifteen children completed the 12-week study. Mean scores on both symptom measures showed improvements (decreases) over the study period, but only the change in the SRS was significant. The ABC improved -\u20097.1 points (95% CI -\u200917.4 to 3.2), and the SRS improved -\u20099.7 points (95% CI -\u200918.7 to -\u20090.8). We identified 77 urinary metabolites that were correlated with changes in symptoms, and they clustered into pathways of oxidative stress, amino acid/gut microbiome, neurotransmitters, hormones, and sphingomyelin metabolism.

This multicenter, double-blind, 2-armed, sham-controlled randomized clinical trial, conducted from May 1, 2022, through November 30, 2023, assessed children aged 3 to 14 years with ASD at 8 medical centers in China. Participants underwent daily 20-minute sessions of active tPCS (0.7 mA) or sham tPCS (brief 0.7 mA ramp-up and ramp-down) for 20 sessions over 4 weeks with anode over the right cerebellar hemisphere and cathode over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (12.56-cm2-circular, 4-cm-diameter circular electrodes).

Therapies specifically targeting RBs have been underexplored despite advances in understanding their neurobiological basis. This study aims to evaluate whether high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) can reduce dysfunctional RBs in autistic children and investigate whether improvements differ between lower-order and higher-order RBs based on the brain regions stimulated. The study entails a multi-session, sham-controlled, site-controlled, double-blind, and between-subjects design. The study will include participants with an ASD diagnosis (aged 8-13 years; IQ\u2009\u2265\u200970), who will undergo the HD-tDCS intervention for 10 sessions. Participants will be randomly assigned to three conditions: (1) Pre-Motor Active Group (active HD-tDCS over pre-SMA cortex); (2) Frontal Active Group (active HD-tDCS over dlPFC); (3) Placebo Control Group. In the active HD-tDCS conditions, the current will be delivered through a 4\u2009\u00d7\u20091 montage; small circular electrodes will be used with the cathode placed centrally with a current intensity of 0.5\u00a0mA for a total of 20\u00a0min (30\u00a0s ramp up/down) per session. Participants during the sham condition will undergo the same procedures as those in the both active conditions actual placement of electrodes, and turning on the HD-tDCS equipment (30\u00a0s). The assessment will be completed at baseline (T0), immediately after the end of the intervention (T1) and 3 months after the end of the intervention (T2). The primary outcome measure will be the Total Score of the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised. The secondary outcomes measures will comprise ASD symptoms, sensory processing pattern, emotional/behavioral problems, sleep functioning, parental stress, neuropsychological features and High-Density EEG connectivity. We hypothesize that active HD-tDCS will lead to significant reduction in the total score of the primary outcome compared to Sham Group, with site-specific effects on lower-order and higher-order RBs.

In recent years, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been applied in interventions for ASD, often targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). However, studies investigating anodal and cathodal tDCS interventions have reported differing outcomes. Therefore, this study aimed to compare and analyze the effects of these two stimulations through a randomized controlled trial, utilizing both behavioral assessments and EEG proxy markers capable of characterizing the brain's excitatory-inhibitory balance. This study recruited a total of 24 children with ASD (20 males and 4 females; mean age\u202f\u00b1\u202fSD: 5.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.2 years), who were randomly divided into two groups receiving either anodal or cathodal tDCS targeting the DLPFC. The stimulation intensity was set at 1\u202fmA, administered five times per week for a total of 20 sessions. Behavioral intervention outcomes were assessed using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and the Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC). Additionally, the study evaluated the effects of tDCS on the brain's excitatory-inhibitory balance by analyzing corrected periodic alpha oscillation power and bandwidth, as well as non-periodic exponent and offset derived from EEG data. Following anodal tDCS intervention, results from the SRS scale indicated a decrease in overall scores, with significant differences observed in social communication and social motivation among children. On the ABC scale, overall scores also decreased, with significant differences noted in sensory behavior, social relating, body and object use, and language and communication skills. Non-periodic exponent and offsets increased following anodal tDCS stimulation, whereas they decreased after cathodal tDCS stimulation. Regarding alpha oscillation power, there was a significant increase following anodal tDCS and a significant decrease following cathodal tDCS. In terms of alpha oscillation bandwidth, there was a reduction following anodal tDCS and an increase following cathodal tDCS. Further correlation analysis revealed that in children who received anodal tDCS intervention, non-periodic exponent showed correlations with behaviors such as social communication. Our study results demonstrated that anodal and cathodal tDCS targeting the left DLPFC had distinct effects on the behavior and excitatory-inhibitory balance of children with ASD. Anodal tDCS intervention appeared to have a more positive impact compared to cathodal intervention. However, the sample size was small, and we focused solely on the effects of tDCS, with our experimental design perhaps not being able to generalize to all external manipulations of excitability in our study.

It facilitates empathy, emotion regulation, and prosocial commitment. Mental disorders characterized by social interaction dysfunction, such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD), and Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), often exhibit atypical synchronization with others across multiple levels. With the introduction of the \"second-person\" neuroscience perspective, our understanding of interpersonal neural synchronization (INS) has improved, however, so far, it has hardly impacted the development of novel therapeutic interventions. To evaluate the potential of INS-based treatments for mental disorders, we performed two systematic literature searches identifying studies that directly target INS through neurofeedback (12 publications; 9 independent studies) or brain stimulation techniques (7 studies), following PRISMA guidelines. In addition, we narratively review indirect INS manipulations through behavioral, biofeedback, or hormonal interventions. We discuss the potential of such treatments for ASD, RAD, and SAD and using a systematic database search assess the acceptability of neurofeedback (4 studies) and neurostimulation (4 studies) in patients with social dysfunction. Although behavioral approaches, such as engaging in eye contact or cooperative actions, have been shown to be associated with increased INS, little is known about potential long-term consequences of such interventions. Few proof-of-concept studies have utilized brain stimulation techniques, like transcranial direct current stimulation or INS-based neurofeedback, showing feasibility and preliminary evidence that such interventions can boost behavioral synchrony and social connectedness. Yet, optimal brain stimulation protocols and neurofeedback parameters are still undefined. For ASD, RAD, or SAD, so far no randomized controlled trial has proven the efficacy of direct INS-based intervention techniques, although in general brain stimulation and neurofeedback methods seem to be well accepted in these patient groups. Significant work remains to translate INS-based manipulations into effective treatments for social interaction disorders. Future research should focus on mechanistic insights into INS, technological advancements, and rigorous design standards. Furthermore, it will be key to compare interventions directly targeting INS to those targeting other modalities of synchrony as well as to define optimal target dyads and target synchrony states in clinical interventions., keywords: N/A"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

The development of treatments that target common neural circuit dysfunctions caused by known genetic defects, namely, disruption of the excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance, is promising. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is capable of modulating the E/I balance in healthy individuals, yet its clinical and neurobiological effects in ASD remain elusive. This double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial investigated the effects of multisession cathodal prefrontal tDCS coupled with online cognitive remediation on social functioning, information processing efficiency and the E/I balance in ASD patients aged 14-21 years.

Cerebellum is best known for its role in controlling motor behaviors; however, recently, there have been significant reports showed that dysfunction in cerebellar-cerebral networks contributes significantly to many of the clinical features of ASD. Hereby, this is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) study examining the potential modulating effects of bilateral anodal tDCS stimulation over cerebellar hemispheres on the resting-state brain complexity in children with ASD. Thirty-six children with ASD (aged 4-14) years old were divided equally and randomly into a tDCS treatment group, which underwent 10 sessions (20-min duration, five sessions/per week) of bilateral anodal tDCS stimulation applied over left and right cerebellar hemispheres, and control group underwent the same procedures, but with sham tDCS stimulation. Resting-state brain complexity was evaluated through recording and calculating the approximate entropy (ApxEnt) values of the resting-state electroencephalograph (EEG) data obtained from a 64-channel EEG system before and after the interventions. Repeated measures of ANOVA showed that tDCS had significant effects on the treatment group (Wilks' Lambda\u2009=\u20090.29, F (15, 16)\u2009=\u20092.67, p\u2009=\u20090.03) compared with the control group.

One of these approaches is modulation of activity of the brain regions involved in ASD symptoms. This study examined the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on autism symptom severity, theory of mind, emotion regulation strategies, and emotional-behavioral functions in children with ASD. Thirty-two children (M<sub>age</sub> \u00a0=\u00a010.16, SD\u00a0=\u00a01.93, range 7-12\u2009years) diagnosed with ASD were randomly assigned to active (N\u00a0=\u00a017) or sham stimulation (N\u00a0=\u00a015) groups in a randomized, sham-controlled, parallel-group design. Participants underwent 10 sessions of active (1.5\u00a0mA, 15\u2009min, bilateral left anodal/right cathodal DLPFC, 2 sessions per week) or sham tDCS. Autism symptom severity, theory of mind, emotion regulation strategies, and emotional-behavioral functioning of the patients were assessed at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and 1 month after the intervention. A significant improvement of autism symptom severity (i.e., communication), theory of mind (i.e., ToM 3), and emotion regulation strategies was observed for the active as compared to the sham stimulation group at the end of the intervention, and these effects were maintained at the one-month follow-up. The results suggest that repeated tDCS with anodal stimulation of left and cathodal stimulation of right DLPFC improves autism symptom severity as well as social cognition and emotion regulation in ASD. LAY SUMMARY: Previous research has suggested that targeting core mechanisms underlying cognitive-emotional and behavioral deficits of autistic children might improve symptoms of ASD. Deficient social and behavioral functioning, impaired theory of mind, and emotional regulation deficits have been identified as core treatment targets for this group. Specific subregions of the prefrontal cortex are involved in these deficits, including hypoactivity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Upregulation of this area with non-invasive brain stimulation, namely anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), results in improved social and behavioral functioning in children with ASD. Very few studies have however examined the effects of this intervention on theory of mind, emotional regulation, and emotional-behavioral problems. We examined the effects of anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC (F3), combined with cathodal tDCS over the right DLPFC (F4) on autism symptom severity as well as theory of mind, emotional regulation, and emotional-behavioral problems of children with ASD. This intervention improved autism symptom severity, specific domains of theory of mind, and emotion regulation. These findings have clinical implications for the treatment of ASD and suggest that targeting core mechanisms underlying socio-cognitive-emotional deficits of autistic children using tDCS might improve symptoms of ASD., keywords: Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Child, Emotional Regulation, Humans, Prefrontal Cortex, Theory of Mind, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

Exclusion criteria included current stimulant drug treatment, current moderate to severe symptoms of depression or anxiety, diagnosis of bipolar disorder with a manic or depressive episode in the last year, diagnosis of schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder, and diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder; 55 of participants completed follow-up after 4 weeks. Thirty-minute daily sessions of home-based tDCS for 4 weeks, 2 mA anodal-right and cathodal-left prefrontal stimulation with 35-cm2 carbon electrodes.

A frontal-posterior network of regions including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is involved in ToM. Previous studies show an underactivation of these regions in ASD. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation method for causally investigating brain-behavior relationships via induction of cortical excitability alterations. tDCS, mostly over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, has been increasingly applied for improving behavioral problems in ASD leaving other potentially interesting regions untouched. Here we investigated contribution of the vmPFC and right TPJ in ToM abilities of ASD children via tDCS in a pilot study. Sixteen children with ASD (mean age\u00a0=\u00a010.7\u00a0\u00b1\u20091.9) underwent three tDCS sessions (1\u00a0mA, 20\u2009min) in a randomized, sham-controlled design. Stimulation protocols included: (a) anodal vmPFC tDCS, (b) anodal r-TPJ tDCS, and (c) sham tDCS. ToM abilities were explored during tDCS using the theory of mind test (TOMT). Our results show that activation of the vmPFC with anodal tDCS significantly improved ToM in children with ASD compared with both, r-TPJ tDCS, and sham stimulation. Specifically, precursors of ToM (e.g., emotion recognition, perception, and imitation) and elementary ToM skills (e.g., first-order mental state reasoning) were significantly improved by anodal vmPFC tDCS. Based on these results, the vmPFC could be a potential target region for the reduction of ASD symptoms via noninvasive brain stimulation, which should be examined in larger detail in future studies. LAY SUMMARY: Theory of mind (ToM) is the ability to infer mental states of oneself and others, which is impaired in autism. Brain imaging studies have shown involvement of two brain regions in ToM (ventromedial prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal junction) which are underactivated in autism. We increased activation of these regions via noninvasive brain stimulation in this experiment to see how it would affect ToM abilities in autism. We found that increased activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex improved ToM abilities in children with autism., keywords: Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Child, Humans, Pilot Projects, Prefrontal Cortex, Theory of Mind, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a technique that applies a weak electrical current to the brain in order to modulate neural excitability and alter connectivity. Combined with specific cognitive tasks, it allows to facilitate and consolidate the respective training effects. Therefore, application of tDCS in brain areas relevant to social cognition in combination with a specific cognitive training is a promising treatment approach for ASD. A phase-IIa pilot randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, parallel-group clinical study is presented, which aims at investigating if 10\u2009days of 20-min multi-channel tDCS stimulation of the bilateral tempo-parietal junction (TPJ) at 2.0\u2009mA in combination with a computer-based cognitive training on perspective taking, intention and emotion understanding, can improve social cognitive abilities in children and adolescents with ASD. The main objectives are to describe the change in parent-rated social responsiveness from baseline (within 1\u2009week before first stimulation) to post-intervention (within 7\u2009days after last stimulation) and to monitor safety and tolerability of the intervention. Secondary objectives include the evaluation of change in parent-rated social responsiveness at follow-up (4\u00a0weeks after end of intervention), change in other ASD core symptoms and psychopathology, social cognitive abilities and neural functioning post-intervention and at follow-up in order to explore underlying neural and cognitive mechanisms. If shown, positive results regarding change in parent-rated social cognition and favourable safety and tolerability of the intervention will confirm tDCS as a promising treatment for ASD core-symptoms. This may be a first step in establishing a new and cost-efficient intervention for individuals with ASD. The trial is registered with the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS), DRKS00014732 .

The true and sham tDCS were administered (anode at the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and cathode at the left temporoparietal junction) on two different days. ASD task was performed before and after each session of tDCS. Auditory hallucination rating scores correlated significantly with false alarm rate, discriminability index, and response bias. SZ patients had a significantly lesser discriminability index in ASD than HC. Single-session tDCS (true versus sham) did not have any significant effect on ASD in SZ patients.

This study attempted to identify any potential therapeutic effects of bilateral anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied over the left and right prefrontal and motor areas on the clinical characteristics of children with ASD. Fifty children with confirmed ASD medical diagnoses were divided equally and randomly into a tDCS treatment group and a control group.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to enhance EF in healthy adults and clinical populations and to improve working memory - a component of the EF - in adults with high-functioning ASD (HF-ASD). We hypothesized that tDCS could improve the EF of HF-ASD patients. Such enhancement could improve their adaptive behaviors. Eight patients with HF-ASD received 10 consecutive cathodal tDCS sessions (2 mA) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (F3) for 15 min each in an open trial. EF (with the Stroop test, Trail Making Test [TMT] A and B, Modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test [mWCST], and Verbal Fluency Test) and behavioral dysexecutive syndrome (with the Behavioral Dysexecutive Syndrome Inventory and the Repetitive and Restricted Behaviour scale) were assessed before and 10 days after treatment.

Such impairment may underlie core deficits in cognition and social functioning. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to enhance WM in both healthy adults and clinical populations, but its efficacy in ASD is unknown. We predicted that bifrontal tDCS would improve WM performances of adults with high-functioning autism during active stimulation compared to sham stimulation and that such enhancement would generalize to an untrained task. Twelve adults with high-functioning ASD engaged in a battery of WM tasks that included backward spatial span, backward digit span, spatial <i>n</i>-back and letter <i>n</i>-back. While engaged, 40\u00a0min of 1.5\u00a0mA bifrontal stimulation was applied over the left and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC). Using a single-blind crossover design, each participant received left anodal/right cathodal stimulation, right anodal/left cathodal stimulation, or sham stimulation, in randomized counterbalanced order on three separate days. Following tDCS, participants again engaged in letter and spatial <i>n</i>-back tasks before taking the Brief Test of Attention (BTA). We used repeated-measures ANOVA to compare overall performance on the WM battery as measured by a composite of <i>z</i>-scores for all five measures. Post hoc ANOVAs, <i>t</i> tests, Friedman's tests, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to measure the online and offline effects of tDCS and to assess performances on individual measures. Compared to sham stimulation, both left DLPFC anodal stimulation (<i>t</i><sub>11</sub>\u00a0=\u00a05.4, <i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.0002) and right DLPFC anodal stimulation (<i>t</i><sub>11</sub>\u00a0=\u00a03.57, <i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.004) improved overall WM performance. Left anodal stimulation (<i>t</i><sub>11</sub>\u00a0=\u00a03.9, <i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and right anodal stimulation (<i>t</i><sub>11</sub>\u00a0=\u00a02.7, <i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.019) enhanced performances during stimulation.

The tasks that showed the largest effects of active stimulation were spatial span backward (<i>z</i><sub>11</sub>\u00a0=\u00a02.39, <i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.017) and BTA (<i>z</i><sub>11</sub>\u00a0=\u00a02.263, <i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.024). In adults with high-functioning ASD, active bifrontal tDCS given during WM tasks appears to improve performance.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of transcranial pulse stimulation on the right temporoparietal junction, which is a key node for social cognition for autism spectrum disorder, and to examine the association between transcranial pulse stimulation and executive and social functions. This double-blinded, randomized, sham-controlled trial included 32 participants (27 males), aged 12-17 years with autism spectrum disorder. All eligible participants were randomized into either the verum or sham transcranial pulse stimulation group, on a 1:1 ratio, based on the Childhood Autism Rating Scale screening score. Sixteen participants received six verum transcranial pulse stimulation sessions (energy level: 0.2-0.25\u2005mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>; pulse frequency: 2.5-4.0\u2005Hz, 800 pulse/session) in 2 weeks on alternate days. The remaining 16 participants received sham transcranial pulse stimulation.

Secondary outcomes included a self-reported questionnaire responded to by parents and cognitive tests responded to by participants. A licensed mental health professional evaluated clinical global impression severity, improvement, efficacy and total score. Results revealed significant interactions in Childhood Autism Rating Scale and other secondary outcomes. Significant group and time effects were found in most secondary outcomes.

Following a series of communications from readers highlighting concerns about the paper (now published on the journal website), the journal editors requested that the authors send them the raw data from the trial. In response the authors informed the editors that; (i) the electronic data base had been lost following a computer outage and (ii) that they could send only 95 out of 120 hard-copy participant data sheets as one site had closed and was no longer contactable. The substantial data loss in and of itself posed a serious difficulty in verifying the correctness of the data presented in the paper. The JCPP then analysed the data from the 95 cases itself. A number of significant discrepancies emerged between the re-analysis and the findings reported in the paper both in terms of means and standard deviations of key outcome variables across the trial.

Levels of serum vitamin D between the two groups were compared by two independent sample <i>t</i>-test, and the difference in the percentages of normal, insufficient and deficient levels of vitamin D was tested by chi-square test, and correlations between vitamin D levels and the total scores or subscales of ABC, CARS, SRS and ATEC were analyzed by Pearson correlation analysis. <b>Result:</b> The 87 subjects in the ASD group included 75 males and 12 females, with a mean (\u00b1SD) age of (4.7\u00b10.7) years. The 301 subjects in the control group included 249 males and 52 females, with a mean (\u00b1SD) age of (4.8\u00b10.8) years.

Supports for autistic children involve the use of adapted interventions that target emotion regulation and social skills, alongside mental health symptoms. The Secret Agent Society Small Group (SAS: SG), an adapted cognitive behavioural program, has demonstrated efficacy through lab-delivered randomized control trials. However, research is still needed on its effectiveness when delivered by publicly funded, community-based autism providers under real-world ecologically valid conditions, especially within the context of a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted access to community-based supports and services for autistic children, and programs have adapted their services to online platforms. However, questions remain about the feasibility and clinical utility of evidence-based interventions and services delivered virtually in community-based settings. The 9-week SAS: SG program was delivered virtually by seven community-based autism service providers during 2020-2021. The program included the use of computer-based games, role-playing tasks, and home missions. Caregivers completed surveys at three timepoints: pre-, post-intervention, and after a 3-month follow-up session. Surveys assessed caregivers' perception of the program's acceptability and level of satisfaction, as well as their child's social and emotional regulation skills and related mental health challenges. A total of 77 caregivers (94% gender identity females; Mean\u2009=\u200942.1 years, SD\u2009=\u20096.5 years) and their children (79% gender identity males; Mean\u2009=\u20099.9 years, SD\u2009=\u20091.3 years) completed the SAS: SG program. Caregivers agreed that the program was acceptable (95%) and were highly satisfied\u00a0(90%). Caregivers reported significant reduction in their child's emotion reactivity from pre- to post-intervention (-1.78 (95% CI, -3.20 to -0.29), p\u2009=\u20090.01, d\u2009=\u20090.36), that continued to decrease after the 3-month booster session (-1.75 (95% CI, -3.34 to -0.16), p\u2009=\u20090.02, d\u2009=\u20090.33).

Vitamin D is metabolized into a seco-steroid hormone that regulates about 3% of the 26,000 genes in the coding human genome. It is also a neurosteroid that is active in brain development, having effects on cellular proliferation, differentiation, calcium signaling, neurotrophic and neuroprotective actions; it also appears to have an effect on neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. Children who are, or who are destined to become, autistic have lower 25(OH)D levels at 3\u00a0months of gestation, at birth and at age 8 compared to their unaffected siblings. Two open label trials found high dose vitamin D improves the core symptoms of autism in about 75% of autistic children. A few of the improvements were remarkable. The vitamin D doses used in these children were 300\u00a0IU/KG/day up to a maximum of 5000\u00a0IU/day (highest final 25(OH)D level reached was 45\u00a0ng/ml). The other study used 150,000\u00a0IU/month IM as well as 400\u00a0IU/day [highest final 25(OH)D level was 52\u00a0ng/ml]. These two open label trials were recently confirmed with a randomized controlled trial (RCT) using 300\u00a0IU/kg/day with a maximum of 5000\u00a0IU/day and resulted in effects similar to the two open label studies. In terms of prevention, a recent small study showed vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy (5000\u00a0IU/day) and during infancy and early childhood (1000\u00a0IU/day) significantly reduced the expected incidence of autism in mothers who already had one autistic child from 20% to 5%. Vitamin D is safe; for example, over the last 15\u00a0years, Poison Control reports there have been approximately 15,000 cases of vitamin D overdose. However only three of these 15,000 people developed clinical toxicity and no one died. Given those facts, practitioners might consider treating autism with 300\u00a0IU/kg/day, and seek to prevent autism by supplementing pregnant and lactating women (5000\u00a0IU/day) and infants and young children (150\u00a0IU/kg/day) checking 25(OH)D levels every 3\u00a0months. These doses will increase 25(OH)D blood levels to those recommended by the Endocrine Society.

It has been previously reported that there is vitamin D deficiency in autistic children; however, there is a lack of randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation in ASD children. This study is a double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (RCT) that was conducted on 109 children with ASD (85 boys and 24 girls; aged 3-10\u00a0years). The aim of this study was to assess the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the core symptoms of autism in children. ASD patients were randomized to receive vitamin D3 or placebo for 4\u00a0months. The serum levels of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25 (OH)D) were measured at the beginning and at the end of the study.

Growing evidence suggests that alterations in brain networks may contribute to ASD symptoms. The cerebellum, with its widespread connections to the cortex, has emerged as a potential key player in ASD. Non-invasive neuromodulation techniques, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) offer a promising avenue for modulating brain activity and potentially alleviating ASD symptoms. In addition, preclinical studies in rodents further emphasize the therapeutic effect of cerebellar stimulation to target autism-related symptoms. This article reviews both clinical and preclinical studies aiming to modulate cerebellar circuits to improve symptoms of ASD. We found ten relevant studies assessing the effect of cerebellar neuromodulation in human and preclinical models. Posterior cerebellar tDCS represented the most frequent neuromodulation method and suggested that cerebellar tDCS can lead to improvements in symptoms of ASD and restore cerebellar connectivity in individuals with ASD. In neurotypical participants, there is evidence that cerebellar tDCS can enhance social cognitive abilities. These results are in line with preclinical studies, suggesting that chemogenetic stimulation can modulate cerebellar circuits involved in ASD and improve related behaviors. Further research is needed to establish standardized protocols, assess long-term effects, and investigate the underlying mechanisms of cerebellar stimulation.

The appropriate screening and diagnosis must be realized to improve the children's prognosis. Moreover, appropriate treatments are necessary to promote better social integration and development. In this scenario, this systematic review aims to evaluate the impacts of behavioral therapies applied in healthcare settings for patients with ASD. This systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines. The databases MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL (Cochrane), and Lilacs were accessed, and gray and manual searches were performed. The search strategy was created with terms referring to autism and behavioral therapy. The studies were assessed qualitatively. Randomized clinical trials and observational studies demonstrated improvements in cognitive and verbal components of patients who received behavioral therapies in therapeutic settings. These results indicate a positive impact of both cognitive-behavioral therapy and ESDM on the development of patients' skills. Among the cognitive-behavioral therapies, the one based on the MASSI protocol did not impact the reduction of anxious symptoms. As for cognitive-behavioral therapy, one study demonstrated that the Behavioral Intervention for Anxiety in Children with Autism (BIACA), when compared to the Coping Cat protocol, improves cognition and reduces anxiety symptoms. Despite these results, further randomized clinical trials comparing behavioral therapies with one another are needed.

We begin by reviewing several mechanisms by which nutrients maximize brain health, including enabling metabolic reactions to occur, supporting mitochondrial function, reducing inflammation and assisting with detoxification. Circumstances that may contribute to an individual requiring additional nutrients beyond what are available in the diet, such as consumption of nutritionally depleted food, individual differences in biological need, long-term medication use and gut-brain health needs are then reviewed. These factors underpin the importance of tackling deficiencies relative to individual metabolic requirements with a broad spectrum of micronutrients, as opposed to a single nutrient approach, to address personal metabolic needs and/or environmentally induced nutrient depletions. The evidence for treating psychological symptoms with supplementary micronutrients is presented, summarizing research using broad-spectrum micronutrients in the treatment of mental health issues including aggression, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and emotional dysregulation, often with medium between-group effect sizes compared with placebo, with clinically meaningful changes. The breadth and consistency of the findings highlight the importance of receiving a complete foundation of nutrients to optimize brain health; however, the small number of studies identifies the importance of future work to replicate these preliminary findings. Documented safety in 8-week randomized controlled trials with open-label extensions up to 16\u2009weeks and longer-term follow-up for 1.5-5\u2009years in smaller samples provide reassurance that this treatment approach does not result in serious adverse events.

Applied behaviour analysis (ABA) and music therapy are recognised interventions for improving ASD symptoms. However, the specific benefits of parent-child music therapy and ABA for autistic children and their mothers remain uncertain. This study evaluated the effects of parent-child music therapy on preschool autistic children and their mothers. A randomised controlled trial was conducted with 100 mother-child pairs assigned to either the control group receiving ABA or the intervention group receiving both music therapy and ABA. Qualitative interviews were conducted post-intervention for 12 mothers. Children in the intervention group exhibited lower scores for ASD symptoms than those in the control group. Moreover, mothers in the intervention group demonstrated reduced dysfunctional parent-child interaction, lower overall parental stress, significantly improved family functioning, and increased levels of hope compared with those in the control group. Mothers held positive views regarding music therapy. Combining ABA with parent-child music therapy can alleviate ASD symptoms in children and reduce stress in mothers. Improved parent-child interaction and enhanced family functioning further support the benefits of this combined approach. Parent-child music therapy, combined with ABA demonstrated positive outcomes for autistic children, including reduced ASD symptoms, improved parent-child interaction, decreased parental stress, enhanced family functioning, and increased hope.

They struggle to balance caring for their child and other tasks. This can affect their emotional well-being and cause guilt and other psychological problems. WHAT DOES THE PAPER ADD TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing with finger movements can reduce guilt in parents of autistic children. Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing with Elite mobile health software movements can reduce guilt in parents of autistic children.

Healthcare providers are encouraged to use these methods to help with psychological issues in children with autism. Psychiatric nurses are encouraged to utilize this treatment approach for parents of children with autism, as well as to help alleviate feelings of guilt more broadly. INTRODUCTION: Caring for an autistic child at home can be challenging for parents, as it can make it difficult to balance their responsibilities. This imbalance can negatively affect the emotional well-being of the caregiver and lead to feelings of guilt. While this is a known issue, there may be gaps in knowledge specific to Iran. In this study, a new method was introduced to address this issue. This study aimed to examine the impact of desensitization with eye movements and reprocessing (EMDR) on reducing parental guilt among autistic children's families. We aim to examine the effectiveness of two different treatment methods. This study involved 90 parents (60 mothers, 30 fathers) of autistic children randomly assigned to either an experimental or control group. The two experimental groups received a 45-min intervention session once a week for 3\u2009weeks, while the control group did not receive any intervention. Data on feelings of guilt was collected using a questionnaire. After 30\u2009days, both groups took a follow-up test. The data were analysed using statistical software. This study found that there were significant differences in guilt feelings among different groups of EMDR therapy and a control group. Specifically, no significant differences were observed in the mean guilt scores between the experimental and control groups at the pre-intervention stage (p\u2009>\u2009.05). However, the experimental groups exhibited significantly lower mean guilt scores immediately after the intervention and 1\u2009month later than the control group (p\u2009<\u2009.05). Immediately after the intervention and 1\u2009month later, no significant differences were observed between the two experimental groups (p\u2009>\u2009.05). The findings of this study demonstrate the efficacy of desensitization treatment using eye movements and reprocessing in reducing feelings of guilt among autistic children's parents. In the follow-up phase, it seems that the two-way stimulation method with finger movements is more effective than Elite software in terms of the continuity of the effect.

The aim of this pilot study (prospective randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled) was to evaluate efficacy of the biological response modifier Juvenil in modulating the microbiome of children with ASD and, in particular, whether Juvenil is able to alleviate the symptoms of ASD. In total, 20 children with ASD and 12 neurotypical children were included in our study. Supplementation of ASD children lasted for three months. To confirm Juvenil's impact on the gut microbiome, stool samples were collected from all children and the microbiome's composition was analyzed. This pilot study demonstrated that the gut microbiome of ASD children differed significantly from that of healthy controls and was converted by Juvenil supplementation toward a more neurotypical microbiome that positively modulated children's autism symptoms., keywords: Humans, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Pilot Projects, Double-Blind Method, Male, Female, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Dietary Supplements, Feces, Child, Preschool, Prospective Studies, Autistic Disorder, Dysbiosis"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

While cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) applications appear promising, trials to date have largely excluded social communication skill development and have not been designed to include a wider range of emotional challenges. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to pilot a uniquely modified CBT program targeting emotion regulation, including social communication training, and explicitly focusing on the child's areas of circumscribed interest in order to teach skills and promote generalization. Forty participants were randomly assigned to either the CBT group or a waitlist control (WLC) group, resulting in 20 school-aged children in each group. The treatment approach was determined to be feasible and acceptable, and therapy engagement and attendance were reasonably high. Caregivers expressed high satisfaction with the program, qualitatively citing gains in skills such as social problem-solving, emotion identification, and identifying and processing cognitive distortions. The primary outcome of postintervention changes was not significantly different between the groups (CBT vs. WLC). The mean Social Skills Improvement System score decreased by 0.44 points (95% confidence interval [CI]: -5.04, 4.15) in the CBT group and increased by 0.41 points (95% CI: -4.23, 5.04) in the WLC group, and the postintervention changes were not significantly different between the groups (difference: -0.85; 95% CI: -7.29, 5.60; <i>p</i> = .79).

We evaluated the NDBI strategy use of 191 caregivers prior to participation in NDBIs (or control groups) across multiple randomized controlled trials, using the Measure of NDBI Strategy Implementation, Caregiver Change (MONSI-CC). Clustering analyses were used to examine caregiver variability in NDBI strategy use at intervention entry.

Caregivers starting with limited or emerging skills improved in their strategy use with intervention. Caregivers starting with more skills (consistent/high or variable) maintained higher skills over intervention.

The goal of the present study was to conduct a randomized controlled trial of a 12-week social intervention (SUCCESS), which combined an inclusive social group with a parent education program. Twenty-five 4- to 6-year-olds with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) were randomized to SUCCESS (N\u2009=\u200911) or to treatment as usual (N\u2009=\u200914). Combining a peer group model with a parent training program, the SUCCESS intervention used naturalistic behavioral techniques (e.g., environmental arrangement, natural reinforcement) to increase social initiations to peers. After 12 weeks, children participating in the SUCCESS program made more frequent initiations to peers than children in the treatment-as-usual group, including more prompted and unprompted initiations to request. Additional gains in clinician-rated social functioning were observed in children randomized to SUCCESS, while differential treatment effects were not detected in parent-rated measures. However, lower baseline social motivation was associated with greater parent-reported initiation improvement.

We will also recruit eight healthy donors aged 18-32 years, who will undergo extensive clinical screening. Recipients will be randomised 1:1 to receive FMT or placebo, stratified by biological sex. Capsules will be administered over two consecutive days following an overnight bowel cleanse with follow-up assessments at 6, 12 and 26 weeks post-treatment. The primary outcome is GSRS score at 6 weeks. Other assessments include anthropometry, body composition, hair cortisol concentration, gut microbiome profile, urine/plasma gut-derived metabolites, plasma markers of gut inflammation/permeability and questionnaires on general well-being, sleep quality, physical activity, food diversity and treatment tolerability. Adverse events will be recorded and reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee. Ethics approval for the study was granted by the Central Health and Disability Ethics Committee on 24 August 2021 (reference number: 21/CEN/211). Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented to both scientific and consumer group audiences.

We conducted an electronic database search of Academic Search Premier, CINHAL, ERIC, Medline, and APA PsycINFO in October 2022 and August 2023 and utilized snowball methods to locate relevant reviews of NDBI. We included reviews meeting the following inclusion criteria: (1) review included a meta-analytic synthesis for at least one child outcome; (2) primary studies examined a NDBI; (3) primary studies included children with ASD with a mean pre-treatment age under eight years; (4) primary studies were conducted using a two-group comparison design; and (5) review was published in English. We extracted data on characteristics of the review, participant characteristics from the primary studies, intervention characteristics, and assessed the risk of bias of the included reviews. We conducted a narrative synthesis across outcomes reported in the included reviews. We included five reviews from six reports in this overview. Two reviews included studies that examined the Early Start Denver Model, two reviews included studies that examined the Pivotal Response Treatment, and one review included studies examining NDBIs collectively. We found positive effects of NDBIs on child's communication/language, cognition, and adaptive behavior. We found mixed effects for NDBIs on autism symptomatology and restricted and repetitive behaviors. Examination of moderator analyses reported in the included reviews suggested variables influencing the effects of NDBIs included proximity of outcome to intervention, boundedness of outcome to intervention, and study location. As shown in this overview, positive effects of NDBI for young children with ASD are supported by meta-analytic evidence. While the overall findings for NDBI across reviews are positive, the findings on specific outcomes and influential variables moderating the effects of NDBI are inconsistent. Additional evidence from randomized controlled trials and future meta-analyses are needed to strengthen our knowledge of the effects of NDBI for young children with ASD.Protocol Registration: PROSPERO CRD42022353045., keywords: Humans, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Behavior Therapy, Child, Child, Preschool, Meta-Analysis as Topic"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

Although pathways to depression are complex, emotional reactivity and negative self-esteem are two risk factors for depression in autistic and non-autistic youth. Although autistic youth are more likely to experience depression than their non-autistic peers, psychotherapy options for autistic youth are very limited; community guidance in the development and testing of psychotherapy programs is a promising approach in autism. Therefore, in this study, we designed an autism-adapted CBT-DAY, in collaboration with autistic community members. Specifically, CBT-DAY combined neurodiversity-affirming and cognitive behavioral approaches to target emotional reactivity and self-esteem in youth to improve depressive symptom severity in a group setting across 12\u2009weeks. We examined the preliminary feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of CBT-DAY in a pilot non-randomized trial. In addition, we implemented a rigorous protocol for assessing, monitoring, and addressing potential harms in this intervention. Results from 24 autistic youth (11-17\u2009years old) suggest that CBT-DAY may be feasible to use in an outpatient clinical setting and generally acceptable to youth and their caregivers.

Music therapy holds promise as an intervention for individuals with autism, harnessing their strengths in music processing to enhance communication and expression. While previous randomized controlled trials have demonstrated positive outcomes in terms of global improvement and quality of life, their reliance on psychological outcomes restricts our understanding of underlying mechanisms. This paper introduces the protocol for the Music for Autism study, a randomized crossover trial designed to investigate the effects of a 12-week music therapy intervention on a range of psychometric, neuroimaging, and biological outcomes in school-aged children with autism. The protocol builds upon previous research and aims to both replicate and expand upon findings that demonstrated improvements in social communication and functional brain connectivity following a music intervention. The primary objective of this trial is to determine whether music therapy leads to improvements in social communication and functional brain connectivity as compared to play-based therapy. In addition, secondary aims include exploring various relevant psychometric, neuroimaging, and biological outcomes. To achieve these objectives, we will enroll 80 participants aged 6-12\u2009years in this international, assessor-blinded, crossover randomized controlled trial. Each participant will be randomly assigned to receive either music therapy or play-based therapy for a period of 12\u2009weeks, followed by a 12-week washout period, after which they will receive the alternate intervention. Assessments will be conducted four times, before and after each intervention period. The protocol of the Music for Autism trial provides a comprehensive framework for studying the effects of music therapy on a range of multidimensional outcomes in children with autism. The findings from this trial have the potential to contribute to the development of evidence-based interventions that leverage strengths in music processing to address the complex challenges faced by individuals with autism. <b>Clinical Trial Registration</b>: Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT04936048., keywords: N/A"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

NIBS is beginning to be applied in both research and clinical settings for the treatment of core and associated symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) including social communication deficits, restricted and repetitive behaviors, irritability, hyperactivity, depression and impairments in executive functioning and sensorimotor integration. Though there is much promise for these targeted device-based interventions, in other disorders (including adult major depressive disorder (MDD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) where rTMS is FDA cleared), data on the safety and efficacy of these interventions in individuals with ASD is limited especially in younger children when neurodevelopmental interventions typically begin. Most studies are open-label, small scale, and/or focused on a restricted subgroup of individuals with ASD. There is a need for larger, randomized controlled trials that incorporate neuroimaging in order to develop predictive biomarkers of treatment response and optimize treatment parameters. We contend that until such studies are conducted, we do not have adequate estimates of the safety and efficacy of NIBS interventions in children across the spectrum. Thus, broad off-label use of these techniques in this population is not supported by currently available evidence.

The experimental group received treatment based on an applied behavioral approach, such as PECS, DTT, PRT, TEACCH, ESDM, and EIBI. After examining seventeen studies, the researchers found that each type of behavioral intervention had a positive impact. Naturalistic protocols that employed PRT and PECS improved ASD symptoms in general, despite their targeting of particular cognitive domains such as language. ESDM enhanced receptive language, particularly in preschool-aged children. Structured and integrated interventions, like EIBI and TEACCH, improved overall adaptive functioning. Combining DTT with a TEACCH program produced greater benefits in linguistic, affective-social, and personal autonomy domains. However, there is a scarcity of high-quality research available on behavioral interventions for ASD. Further comparative studies are necessary to identify cost-efficient interventions.

Whilst some people embrace autism as part of their identity, others struggle with their difficulties, and some seek treatment. There are no current interventions that result in complete reduction of autism features. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter for the cholinergic system and has a role in attention, novelty seeking, and memory. Low levels of acetylcholine have been investigated as a potential contributor to autism symptomatology. Donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine (commonly referred to as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) all inhibit acetylcholinesterase, and have slightly different modes of action and biological availability, so their effectiveness and side-effect profiles may vary.

Primary and secondary outcomes of interest were measured postintervention, using subscales of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (score 0 to 3; higher scores = greater impairment). Very low-certainty evidence showed there was little to no difference between the two groups postintervention for social communication (mean difference (MD) -2.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.88 to 0.38), and restricted and repetitive behaviour (MD -0.55, 95% CI -3.47 to 2.37). Overall autism features were not assessed. Adverse events may be higher in the galantamine plus risperidone group (75%) compared with the placebo plus risperidone group (35%): odds ratio 5.57, 95% CI 1.42 to 21.86, low-certainty evidence. No serious adverse events were reported. Low-certainty evidence showed a small difference in irritability (MD -3.50, 95% CI -6.39 to -0.61), with the galantamine plus risperidone group showing a greater decline on the irritability subscale than the placebo group postintervention. There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in hyperactivity postintervention (MD -5.20, 95% CI -10.51 to 0.11). General health and function were not assessed. Donepezil versus placebo One study compared donepezil to placebo (34 participants aged 8 years to 17 years). Primary outcomes of interest were measured postintervention, using subscales of the Modified Version of The Real Life Rating Scale (scored 0 to 3; higher scores = greater impairment). Very low-certainty evidence showed no evidence of group differences immediately postintervention in overall autism features (MD 0.07, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.33), or in the autism symptom domains of social communication (MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.30), and restricted and repetitive behaviours (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.35). Significant adverse events leading to study withdrawal in at least one participant was implied in the data analysis section, but not explicitly reported. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of donepezil, compared to placebo, on the secondary outcomes of interest, including irritability (MD 1.08, 95% CI -0.41 to 2.57), hyperactivity (MD 2.60, 95% CI 0.50 to 4.70), and general health and function (MD 0.03, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.54) postintervention. Across all analyses within this comparison, we judged the evidence to be very low-certainty due to high risk of bias, and very serious imprecision (results based on one small study with wide confidence intervals). The study narratively reported adverse events for the study as a whole, rather than by treatment group. Evidence about the effectiveness of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors as a medication to improve outcomes for autistic adults is lacking, and for autistic children is very uncertain. There is a need for more evidence of improvement in outcomes of relevance to clinical care, autistic people, and their families. There are a number of ongoing studies involving acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and future updates of this review may add to the current evidence., keywords: Child, Humans, Acetylcholine, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Cholinesterase Inhibitors, Donepezil, Galantamine, Risperidone, Rivastigmine, Child, Preschool, Adolescent"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

We conducted an 8-week randomized, double-blind sham-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of inhibitory continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS, a variant of rTMS) over the left DLPFC in individuals with ASD. Sixty children, adolescents and young adults (aged 8-30\u2009years) with ASD without co-occurring intellectual disabilities were randomized to a 16-session 8-week cTBS versus sham stimulation course, with a follow-up 4\u2009weeks after the trial. The Active group was not superior to the Sham group in any clinical or neuropsychological metrics at Week 8 or Week 12. Time effects of 8-week cTBS on symptoms and executive function were remarkable in both Active and Sham groups, with comparable response rates and effect sizes of changes in symptoms/cognition between groups. Our results from a sufficiently powered sample do not endorse the superior efficacy of cTBS over the left DLPFC to the shamed stimulation for children, adolescents and adults with ASD.

Providing mental health programs in schools may increase access to care for autistic youth with anxiety. The purpose of the study was to train interdisciplinary school providers to deliver school-based Facing Your Fears, a cognitive behavior therapy program for anxiety in autistic youth. Seventy-seven interdisciplinary school providers across 25 elementary/middle schools were trained by their colleagues and members of the research (train-the-trainer approach). Eighty-one students with autism or suspected autism, ages 8-14\u2009years, were randomly assigned to either school-based Facing Your Fears or usual care. Students in school-based Facing Your Fears showed significant reductions in anxiety compared to students in usual care according to caregiver and student report. Other measures involved examining change in provider cognitive behavior therapy knowledge after training and determining how well interdisciplinary school providers were able to deliver school-based Facing Your Fears. Results indicated that interdisciplinary school providers showed significant improvements in cognitive behavior therapy knowledge after training. Interdisciplinary school providers were able to deliver most of school-based Facing Your Fears activities and with good quality. The positive outcomes in this study are encouraging.

There has been a growing emphasis on assessing fidelity of evidence-based practices for autistic children in schools. Fidelity measurement should be multidimensional and focus on core intervention components and assess their link with program outcomes. This study evaluated the relation between intervention fidelity ratings from multiple sources, tested the relation between fidelity ratings and child outcomes, and determined the relations between core intervention components and child outcomes in a study of an evidence-based psychosocial intervention designed to promote inclusion of autistic children at school, Remaking Recess. This study extends from a larger randomized controlled trial examining the effect of implementation support on Remaking Recess fidelity and child outcomes. Schools were randomized to receive the intervention or the intervention plus implementation support. Observers, intervention coaches, and school personnel completed fidelity measures to rate completion and quality of intervention delivery. A measure of peer engagement served as the child outcome. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to determine concordance between raters. Two sets of hierarchical linear models were conducted using fidelity indices as predictors of peer engagement. Coach- and self-rated completion and quality scores, observer- and self-rated quality scores, and observer- and coach-rated quality fidelity scores were significantly correlated. Higher observer-rated completion and quality fidelity scores were predictors of higher peer engagement scores. No single intervention component emerged as a significant predictor of peer engagement. This study demonstrates the importance of using a multidimensional approach for measuring fidelity, testing the link between fidelity and child outcomes, and examining how core intervention components may be associated with child outcomes. Future research should clarify how to improve multi-informant reports to provide \"good enough\" ratings of fidelity that provide meaningful information about outcomes in community settings. Fidelity is defined as how closely an intervention is administered in the way the creators intended. Fidelity is important because it allows researchers to determine what exactly is leading to changes. In recent years, there has been an interest in examining fidelity of interventions for autistic children who receive services in school. This study looked at the relationship between fidelity ratings from multiple individuals, the relationship between fidelity and child outcomes, and the relationship between individual intervention component and child changes in a study of Remaking Recess, an intervention for autistic children at school. Schools were randomly selected to receive the intervention only or the intervention plus implementation support from the research team. Observers, intervention coaches, and individuals delivering the intervention themselves completed fidelity measures. Child engagement with peers was measured before and after the intervention. Several measures of self-, coach-, and observer-report fidelity were associated with each other. Higher observer-reported fidelity was associated with higher child peer engagement scores. No single intervention step was linked to child peer engagement and both treatment groups had similar outcomes in terms of fidelity. This study shows the importance of having multiple raters assess different parts of intervention fidelity, looking at the link between fidelity and child outcomes, and seeing how individual intervention steps may be related to outcomes. Future research should aim to find out which types of fidelity ratings are \"good enough\" to lead to positive changes following treatment so that those aspects can be used and targeted in the future., keywords: N/A"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

However, it is costly and requires extensive resources to be effective. This inaccessibility is also further worsened by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, making the shift to a digital approach a sensible option. Among the available ASD therapies, parent-mediated interventions (PMIs) have a broad application and lower implementation cost. Hence, this systematic review aims to evaluate the potential that telehealth-based PMI holds and explore its feasibility throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. To build up this study, a systematic search through PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, Wiley, and Cochrane was performed until 14 January 2021. Using the preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines, we ultimately included six studies in the review. Each study was evaluated utilizing the Cochrane Risk of Bias (ROB)-2 tool. Generally, parents' outcomes (knowledge, satisfaction, and compliance) were higher in intervention group (E-learning) compared to control (standard treatment or wait-list). Children also showed some improvements in social skill, communication skill, and intelligence after receiving the treatment. In addition, coaching or therapist sessions were found to be crucial as adjuvant to support parents during the intervention. In conclusion, internet-based parent-mediated interventions are promising and recommended for managing ASD patients, in the face of pandemic.

This finding was true for standard CBT, which included nine sessions prior to exposure initiation (on average), as well as for CBT personalized for autistic youth, which introduced exposure following the fifth session (on average).

Findings were categorised under the seven themes of the TFA (affective attitude, burden, ethicality, intervention coherence, opportunity costs, perceived effectiveness, self-efficacy) in addition to three themes that were defined following inductive and deductive coding (barriers to implementation, facilitators to implementation, suggestions for improvement). Participants spoke positively about their experience participating in the intervention and perceived the intervention to be appropriate and effective. Most parents (95.5%) reported that they would recommend the Sleeping Sound intervention to other families of autistic children. Barriers to implementation included child and parent anxiety, child health problems, parental preferences, family circumstances, and other (e.g., school holidays).

We searched peer-reviewed international literature to identify clinical trials investigating TMS as a treatment for behavioral and cognitive symptoms of IC-ASD. We identified sixteen studies and were able to conduct a meta-analysis on twelve of these studies. Seven were open-label or used neurotypical controls for baseline cognitive data, and nine were controlled trials. In the latter, waitlist control groups were often used over sham TMS. Only one study conducted a randomized, parallel, double-blind, and sham controlled trial. Favorable safety data was reported in low frequency repetitive TMS, high frequency repetitive TMS, and intermittent theta burst studies. Compared to TMS research of other neuropsychiatric conditions, significantly lower total TMS pulses were delivered in treatment and neuronavigation was not regularly utilized. Quantitatively, our multivariate meta-analysis results report improvement in cognitive outcomes (pooled Hedges' g\u2009=\u20090.735, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.242, 1.228; p\u2009=\u20090.009) and primarily Criterion B symptomology of IC-ASD (pooled Hedges' g\u2009=\u20090.435, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.359, 0.511; p\u2009<\u20090.001) with low frequency repetitive TMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

Among the hypotheses underlying the involvement of biological and environmental factors, the gut-brain axis is of particular interest in autism spectrum disorders. Several studies have highlighted the related incidence of particular gastrointestinal symptoms (GISs) in children suffering from ASDs. Probiotics have shown success in treating several gastrointestinal dysbiotic disorders; therefore, it is plausible to investigate whether they can alleviate behavioral symptoms as well. On these bases, a randomized double-blind crossover study with a placebo was conducted, evaluating the effects of a mixture of probiotics in a group of 61 subjects aged between 24 months and 16 years old with a diagnosis of ASD. Behavioral evaluation was performed through the administration of a questionnaire including a Parenting Stress Index (PSI) test and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS). The Psycho-Educational Profile and the Autism Spectrum Rating Scale (ASRS) were also evaluated. Microbial composition analyses of fecal samples of the two groups was also performed. The study showed significant improvements in GISs, communication skills, maladaptive behaviors, and perceived parental stress level after the administration of probiotics.

We investigated if attention-based cognitive behavioral treatment, based on mindfulness cognitive therapy (MBCT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), reduces aggressive behavior and improves anger coping in school-aged autistic children (n\u00a0=\u00a051). Children were randomized to an active-control or a treatment condition. The treatment included nine weekly sessions attention-based individual therapy. Parents in both conditions received three weekly psychoeducation group sessions to heighten awareness of expressed emotion (EE). For aggressive behavior, treatment reduced temper tantrums and arguing. No effect was found on destroying things and physical violence. For anger coping, treatment increased adaptive coping strategies of diffusion and social support seeking, but had no effect on assertion, rumination, and maladaptive coping direct anger out and avoidance. Treatment did not impact secondary outcome measures concerning children's quality of life (QoL) and parental stress-levels and psychological well-being. In conclusion, school-aged autistic children are able to acquire self-regulation skills reducing temper tantrums and arguing and increasing the use of adaptive anger coping strategies. The intervention shows potential to improve behavior and regulation, but little transfer to other domains. Limitations and future directions involving the child's social environment, including parents, siblings, and teachers are discussed.

Current research has primarily focused on its use in adolescent treatment-resistant depression. However, recently, rTMS has gained attention among researchers to find its utility in other neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), tics, and psychosis. There is a lack of systematic data on the safety of rTMS in children and adolescents. The aim of this article was to present an overview of the existing literature on the use of rTMS in children and adolescents and examine the relevant safety considerations. We conducted a literature review of the English literature in PubMed on TMS in children and adolescents, using comprehensive search terms and expanding our review to include sources cited by these reports. We reviewed the application of rTMS in psychiatric disorders in the pediatric population. rTMS has been used for depression and anxiety disorders, OCD, ADHD, Tourette syndrome/tics, ASD, and schizophrenia, with variable results. rTMS is a promising treatment in children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders, although larger, sham-controlled, randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) will be required to definitely demonstrate efficacy, as well as to support a safety profile., keywords: N/A"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}

The period following a child's autism diagnosis can present real challenges in adaptation for families. Twenty to 50% of caregivers show clinically significant levels of mental health need within the post-diagnostic period and on an ongoing basis. Best practice guidelines recommend timely post-diagnostic family support. Current provision is patchy, largely unevidenced, and a source of dissatisfaction for both families and professionals. There is a pressing need for an evidenced programme of post-diagnostic support focusing on caregiver mental health and adjustment, alongside autism psycho-education. This trial tests the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a new brief manualised psychosocial intervention designed to address this gap. This is a multi-centre two-parallel-group single (researcher)-blinded randomised controlled trial of the Empower-Autism programme plus treatment-as-usual versus usual local post-diagnostic offer plus treatment-as-usual. Caregivers of children aged 2-15 years with a recent autism diagnosis will be recruited from North West England NHS or local authority centres. Randomisation is individually by child, with one \"index\" caregiver per child, stratified by centre, using 2:1 randomisation ratio to assist recruitment and timely intervention. Empower-Autism is a group-based, manualised, post-diagnostic programme that combines autism psycho-education and psychotherapeutic components based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy to support caregiver mental health, stress management and adjustment to their child's diagnosis.

Thus, we performed an umbrella review of published meta-analyses of controlled clinical trials that investigated the efficacy of psychosocial interventions on both core and related ASD symptoms. Each meta-analysis that was identified was re-estimated using a random-effects model with a restricted maximum likelihood estimator. The methodological quality of included meta-analyses was critically appraised and the credibility of the evidence was assessed algorithmically according to criteria adapted for the purpose of this study. We identified a total of 128 meta-analyses derived from 44 reports. More than half of the non-overlapping meta-analyses were nominally statistically significant and/or displayed a moderate-to-large pooled effect size that favored the psychosocial interventions. The assessment of the credibility of evidence pointed out that the efficacy of early intensive behavioral interventions, developmental interventions, naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions, and parent-mediated interventions was supported by suggestive evidence on at least one outcome in preschool children. Possible outcomes included social communication deficits, global cognitive abilities, and adaptive behaviors. Results also revealed highly suggestive indications that parent-mediated interventions improved disruptive behaviors in early school-aged children. The efficacy of social skills groups was supported by suggestive evidence for improving social communication deficits and overall ASD symptoms in school-aged children and adolescents. Only four meta-analyses had a statistically significant pooled effect size in a sensitivity analysis restricted to randomized controlled trials at low risk of detection bias. This umbrella review confirmed that several psychosocial interventions show promise for improving symptoms related to ASD at different stages of life. However, additional well-designed randomized controlled trials are still required to produce a clearer picture of the efficacy of these interventions.

Specifically, this tDCS protocol optimized information processing efficiency [F(1,39)\u00a0=\u00a04.43, p\u00a0=\u00a0.042, \u03b7<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.10], and the optimization showed a trend to be associated with enhanced rsFC in the right medial prefrontal cortex (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.339, pFDR\u00a0=\u00a0.083). Multisession tDCS with left dlPFC cathode placement and right supraorbital region anode placement paired with concurrent cognitive remediation training promoted social functioning in individuals with ASD. This appeared to be associated with the enhancement of the functional connectivity of the right medial PFC, a major hub for flexible social information processing, allowing these individuals to process information more efficiently in response to different social situations.

These abnormalities are among the main parental concerns when having a child with ASD and have a significant impact on the quality of life of patients, their parents, and more broadly their siblings. Sleep disorders are essentially abnormalities of the sleep-wake rhythm\u00a0-\u00a0primarily sleep onset insomnia or nocturnal awakenings (with difficulty falling back to sleep). These disturbances can be accompanied by other sleep disorders, requiring notably a systematic elimination of the presence of a sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome\u00a0-\u00a0to ensure a personalized and efficient therapeutic approach. Physiologically, the determinants of these sleep disorders are poorly understood, even though several studies point to a significant decrease in melatonin synthesis in people with ASD. Melatonin is a hormone that facilitates falling asleep and maintaining sleep and is also involved in the endogenous synchronization of internal biological clocks. However, the causal factors of this decrease in melatonin synthesis are largely unknown, involving to a small extent the genes involved in melatonin synthesis pathway. The treatment of sleep disorders is relatively systematic: after eliminating other specific sleep disorders associated with the complaint of insomnia, as well as other possible associated comorbidities (such as seizures), a global and graduated therapeutic approach must be put in place. This treatment will be non-pharmacological as a first line, then pharmacological as a second line. A number of non-pharmacological treatment strategies for sleep disorders in typically developing children and adolescents, as well as those with ASD, have been shown to be effective. This treatment requires a combination of: 1) parental education to promote sleep development; 2) setting up bedtime rituals adapted to the child's age and particularities; 3) specific behavioral strategies including bedtime fading, gradual extinction and positive reinforcement of adapted behaviors. It is very essential that the parents are accompanied throughout this therapy. Sleep hygiene and behavioral care must also take into consideration the important role of the zeitgebers of sleep-wake rhythms, i.e. the external environmental factors involved in the synchronization of the biological clocks: regular exposure to light at adapted times, regular meal and wake-up times, social activities and times for going to school. The evidence for the effectiveness of behavioral interventions in the treatment of behavioral insomnia in the typical developmental child is strong, since 94% of children show clinically significant improvements in nighttime sleepiness and waking. By contrast, only about 25% of children with ASD are improved by an approach combining sleep hygiene and behavioral therapy. Melatonin has a special and prominent place in the drug management of sleep disorders associated with ASD. Several clinical trials have shown that melatonin is effective in treating sleep disorders in patients with ASD. This work led to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granting marketing authorization in September 2018 for a sustained-release paediatric melatonin molecule (Slenyto\u00ae). This synthetic molecule is a prolonged release melatonin (PRM) which mimics the physiological pharmacokinetic and secretory characteristics of endogenous melatonin, having a very short blood half-life and prolonged secretion for several hours during the night. A recent study evaluated the efficacy and safety of pediatric PRM (mini-tablets) in 125 children, aged 2 to 17.5 years with mainly ASD. After 15 days on placebo, the children were randomized into two parallel groups, PRM or placebo in a double-blind design for 13 weeks. At endpoint, total sleep time was increased by an average of 57.5 minutes on PRM and only 9.14 minutes on placebo (P=0.034). This difference between the two groups was already significant after three weeks of treatment (P=0.006). Sleep latency was also improved in the PRM group (-39.6 minutes) compared to placebo (-12.51 minutes) (P=0.01). Consolidated sleep duration (uninterrupted by awakenings) was improved by 77.9 minutes for the PRM group and only 25.4 minutes for the placebo group (P<0.001). PRM was well tolerated, the most frequent side effects being headache and daytime drowsiness at the same level with PRM or placebo. In addition, the acceptability by the children for swallowing the mini-tablets was excellent (100% compliance). The efficacy and tolerability of PRM was maintained over the medium and long term in the open phase, over a total study duration of 2 years., keywords: Adolescent, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Humans, Melatonin, Quality of Life, Sleep, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders, Sleep Wake Disorders"}], "max_completion_tokens": 1000}}
